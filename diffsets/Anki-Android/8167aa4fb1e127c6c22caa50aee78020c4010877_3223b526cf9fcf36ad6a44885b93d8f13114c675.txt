  *
  * This fix solves the issue in a very simple way, by ignoring calls to [onTouchEvent]
  * during the call to [onInterceptTouchEvent].
+ *
+ * Another problem with SwipeDismissBehavior is that the way it uses ViewDragHelper,
+ * event interception may happen well past the initial start of the gesture.
+ * ViewDragHelper will capture the view under the finger,
+ * which at this point might be some unrelated view, and *that* view will be moved instead.
+ *
+ * This solves the issue by never intercepting touch events unless the finger is over the snackbar.
+ * This does prevent the user from moving snackbar if they put a finger on it,
+ * move it directly upwards, and then to the side.
+ * However, this inconvenience is rather minor and fixing it properly might require too much effort.
