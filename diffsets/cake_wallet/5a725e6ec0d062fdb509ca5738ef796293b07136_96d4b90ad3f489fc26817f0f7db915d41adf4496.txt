+Investment Risks
+================
+
+	All investments, including investments in Monero, Litecoin and Bitcoin, are speculative in nature and involve substantial risk of loss. We encourage investors to invest carefully. We also encourage investors to get personal advice from professional investment advisors and to make independent investigations before making any investment. We do not in any way guarantee the success of any action you take with respect to investments on the App or otherwise. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. All investments, including investments in Monero, Litecoin or Bitcoin, carry risk and all investment decisions of an individual remain the responsibility of that individual. Do not enter any investment without fully understanding the worst-case scenario of that investment, including but not limited to, large market fluctuations or total loss.
+

+
+Monero, Bitcoin & Litecoin Transactions
+=======================================
+
+	The App does not store Monero, Litecoin or Bitcoin. Monero, Litecoin and Bitcoin exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Monero, Litecoin and Bitcoin networks.

+
+Waiver and Severability
+=======================
+
+	No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
