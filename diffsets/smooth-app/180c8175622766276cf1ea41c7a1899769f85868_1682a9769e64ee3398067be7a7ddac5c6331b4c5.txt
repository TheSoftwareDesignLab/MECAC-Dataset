-SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
------------------------------------------------------------
-
-PREAMBLE
-The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
-development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
-efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
-open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
-with others.
-
-The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
-redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
-fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
-redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
-names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
-however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
-requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
-to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
-
-DEFINITIONS

-Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
-include source files, build scripts and documentation.

-"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
-copyright statement(s).
-
-"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
-distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
-

-writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
