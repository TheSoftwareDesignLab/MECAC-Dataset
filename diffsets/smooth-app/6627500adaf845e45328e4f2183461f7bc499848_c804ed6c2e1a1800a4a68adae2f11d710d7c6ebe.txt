+# Translation File Regeneration Workflow
+
+This document explains the automated translation file regeneration workflow that was added to address issue #6892.
+
+## Overview
+
+The workflow `regenerate-translations.yml` automatically regenerates Flutter translation files when ARB (Application Resource Bundle) files are modified. This eliminates the manual step developers previously needed to perform when adding new translation strings.
+
+## How It Works
+
+### Triggers
+1. **Automatic**: When ARB files in `packages/smooth_app/lib/l10n/*.arb` are pushed to the `develop` branch
+2. **Manual**: Via the "Actions" tab using the "workflow_dispatch" trigger
+
+### Process
+1. **Environment Setup**: Uses the Flutter version specified in `flutter-version.txt` (currently 3.35.1)
+2. **Dependencies**: Installs Flutter dependencies for the smooth_app package
+3. **Tool Installation**: Installs `intl_utils` globally using `flutter pub global activate intl_utils`
+4. **Generation**: Runs `flutter pub global run intl_utils:generate` to create updated translation files
+5. **Change Detection**: Checks if any files were modified during generation
+6. **PR Creation**: If changes are detected, creates an automated PR with the updates
+
+### Generated Files
+The workflow updates these files when needed:
+- `packages/smooth_app/lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart` (main localization class)
+- `packages/smooth_app/lib/l10n/app_localizations_*.dart` (language-specific implementations)
+
+## Testing the Workflow
+
+### Prerequisites
+To test this workflow:
+1. The workflow file must be in the `develop` branch
+2. You need write permissions to the repository
+3. GitHub Actions must be enabled
+
+### Test Scenarios
+
+#### Scenario 1: Modify an ARB file
+1. Edit `packages/smooth_app/lib/l10n/app_en.arb` to add a new translation string:
+   ```json
+   "test_string": "This is a test string",
+   "@test_string": {
+     "description": "A test string for workflow validation"
+   }
+   ```
+2. Commit and push to the `develop` branch
+3. Check the "Actions" tab to see the workflow run
+4. If successful, a PR should be created with regenerated files
+
+#### Scenario 2: Manual trigger
+1. Go to Actions → "🌐 Regenerate Translation Files"
+2. Click "Run workflow" 
+3. Select the `develop` branch
+4. Click "Run workflow"
+5. Monitor the execution and check for PR creation
+
+### Expected Results
+- **No Changes**: If no ARB files were modified since the last generation, the workflow should complete without creating a PR
+- **With Changes**: If ARB files contain new/modified strings, the workflow should:
+  - Successfully regenerate the Dart files
+  - Create a PR with clear description
+  - Apply appropriate labels (`🌐 l10n`, `🤖 automated pr`)
+  - Assign the PR to the triggering user
+
+### Troubleshooting
+
+#### Common Issues
+1. **Flutter Version Mismatch**: Ensure `flutter-version.txt` contains a valid Flutter version
+2. **Permission Errors**: Check that the workflow has `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions
+3. **Dependency Issues**: Verify that `packages/smooth_app/pubspec.yaml` is valid
+
+#### Debug Steps
+1. Check the workflow logs in the Actions tab
+2. Look for error messages in the "Generate translation files" step
+3. Verify that ARB files are syntactically correct JSON
+4. Ensure the l10n configuration in `packages/smooth_app/l10n.yaml` is correct
+
+## Workflow Configuration
+
+The workflow is configured to:
+- Use caching for Flutter SDK and dependencies
+- Run only when ARB files change (efficient)
+- Cancel previous runs if new ones are triggered (saves resources)
+- Create unique branch names to avoid conflicts
+- Provide detailed PR descriptions for easy review
+
+## Integration with Existing Workflows
+
+This workflow complements the existing Crowdin workflow (`crowdin.yml`) which handles:
+- Uploading source strings to Crowdin
+- Downloading translated strings from Crowdin
+- Creating PRs with Crowdin translations
+
+The translation regeneration workflow specifically handles the Flutter code generation step that must occur after ARB file changes.

+            This PR was automatically created to regenerate Flutter translation files after changes to ARB files.
+            
+            ## What changed
+            - Translation files have been regenerated using `intl_utils:generate`
+            - This ensures all generated Dart files are in sync with the ARB translation files
+            
+            ## Files affected
+            The following generated files may have been updated:
+            - `lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart`
+            - `lib/l10n/app_localizations_*.dart`
+            
+            ## How to review
+            1. Check that the generated code looks correct
+            2. Verify that no manual translations were overwritten
+            3. Test the app to ensure translations work properly
+            
+            This PR was automatically generated by the translation regeneration workflow.
