+News: We invented the collaborative scanning app in 2012. 🤳🥫 As we turn 10, we’re reinventing it from the ground up!
+
+This app lets you find food that's good for you and good for the planet by scanning their barcodes.
+You will get personalized health & eco-impact info for 2.3M foods.
+
+<h1>👉  Set your food preferences without ruining your privacy</h1>
+<h1>👉  A scan that truly matches who you are</h1>
+✅ Green: the product matches your criteria
+🛑 Red: there is a problem
+⬜️ Gray: Help us answer you by photographing the products
+<h1>👉  Compare in a few seconds those 3 different tomato sauces left on the shelf.</h1>
+<h1>👉  Get a tailored comparison of any food category</h1>
+
+<h1>Food criteria you can pick</h1>
+🌍 Environment
+⚕️ Health
+🏭 Additives & Ultra processed foods
+🧂 Salt
+🌾 Allergens
+Nutri-Score
+Eco-Score
+
+<h1>👉 Scan, find & compare more than 2,3 million food products</h1>
+
+<h1>👉 Choose products that are good for you ⚕️</h1>
+
+➜ The Nutri-Score grade, from A to E : Nutritional quality
+➜ The NOVA group, from 1 to 4 : Avoid ultra-processed foods (Group 4)
+
+<h1>👉 Choose products that are good the planet 🌍</h1>
+➜ Food causes over 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions
+➜ The Eco-Score grade, from A to E : a synthesis of 16 environmental impacts
+
+<h1>👉 Contribute to Food Transparency</h1>
+
+➜ Open Food Facts is made by everyone, for everyone!
+➜ In short, we're "the Wikipedia of food", as the press nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has also enabled the creation of over 150+ apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.
+➜ Use it to make better food choices
+➜ The app is also collaborative. If the product is missing, contribute pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score, food processing level (NOVA) & Eco-Score.
+➜ Make a difference today by photographing a product from your kitchen.
+➜ Open Food Facts is a non-profit project made by thousands of volunteers from around the world. Why don't you join us ?
+
+<h1>👉 Decipher food labels</h1>
+
+We decipher products labels for you. You'll find:
+➜ Nutrition: The Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat, transfat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein, salt & sodium.
+➜ Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
+➜ Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
+➜ On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.
+
+<h1>👉 Our grades are science-based, and Open Food Facts is helping science!</h1>
+➜ We don't make up things. We rely on peer-reviewed science.
+➜ The Nutri-Score has been created by the independent French team led by Professor Hercberg.
+➜ The NOVA groups on food processing have been designed by the international team of Professor Monteiro.
+➜ The additives synthesis is based on reviews by EFSA on exposure levels on food additives.
+➜ The Eco-Score is based on ground breaking data by ADEME, the French environmental agency, adapted for the world.
+➜ The Open Food Facts community is collaborating with research teams across the planet for research that benefits all.
+
+<h1>👉 Your food, your data. Privacy-friendly app.</h1>
+➜ You can use the app anonymously
+➜ Your food data is yours, and is never sent online
+
+<h1>👉 Set up allergen alerts on products</h1>
+➜ Do you have a Milk, Gluten, Eggs, Soybeans, Nuts, Fish, Celery, Mustard, Sulphites, Peanuts, Sesame seeds, Crustaceans, Molluscs or Lupin allergy ?
+➜ Speed up your shopping with an initial screening with Open Food Facts.
+➜ Be careful that the info & the detection may not be 100% accurate. Always double check by yourself, with the packaging.
