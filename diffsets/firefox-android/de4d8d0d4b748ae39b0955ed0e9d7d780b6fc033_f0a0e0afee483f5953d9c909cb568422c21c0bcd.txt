+  ## Output style of execution status. May be one of [verbose, multi, single, compact].
+  ## For runs with only one test execution the default value is 'verbose', in other cases
+  ## 'multi' is used as the default. The output style 'multi' is not displayed correctly on consoles
+  ## which don't support ansi codes, to avoid corrupted output use single or verbose.
+  ## The output style `compact` is used to produce less detailed output, it prints just Args, test and matrix count, weblinks, cost, and result reports.
