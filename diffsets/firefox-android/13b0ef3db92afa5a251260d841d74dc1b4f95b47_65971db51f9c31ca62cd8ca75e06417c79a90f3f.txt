+### Integration with the Glean SDK
+
+The [Glean SDK](../../../components/service/glean/README.md) can be used to collect [Gecko Telemetry](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html).
+Applications using both this component and the Glean SDK should setup the Gecko Telemetry delegate
+as shown below:
+
+```Kotlin
+    val builder = GeckoRuntimeSettings.Builder()
+    val runtimeSettings = builder
+        .telemetryDelegate(GeckoGleanAdapter()) // Sets up the delegate!
+        .build()
+    // Create the Gecko runtime.
+    GeckoRuntime.create(context, runtimeSettings)
+```
+
+#### Adding new metrics
+
+New Gecko metrics can be added as described [in the Firefox Telemetry docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/start/adding-a-new-probe.html).

   * The component now handles situations where the Android system kills the content process (without killing the main app process) in order to reclaim resources. In those situations the component will automatically recover and restore the last known state of those sessions.
