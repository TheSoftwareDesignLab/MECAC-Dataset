-# Content blocking
-
-## Tracking protection: lists and general overview
-
-We use the disconnect tracking protection lists, these consist of:
-
-- The blacklist: a list of domains to block
-- The entitylist: an override list to unblock certain domains for certain other domains.
-- The google_mapping: a list of modifications for the blacklist.
-
-### The blacklist
-
-The blacklist contains list of domains that should be blocked. Any resources that are hosted
-on these domains should be blocked.
-
-The source lists contain multiple categories, we use **Advertising**, **Social**, **Analytics**, **Content** (aka. "other content trackers").
-We use some items from the **Disconnect** list, those items are moved into the **Social** list when parsing. We ignore **Legacy Disconnect** and
-**Legacy Social**. You can see the code parsing these lists at
-BlockListProcessor.java[BlockListProcessor.java](../app/src/webkit/java/org/mozilla/focus/webkit/matcher/BlocklistProcessor.java).
-
-The google_mapping is similar to the main list - these items are simply addded to the existing categories mentioned above. (The google entries
-in the main **Disconnect** list are discarded since we use those from google_mapping.json.)
-
-Note: each category contains a list of site owners: those names are discarded, we insert every single domain for every owner into the same list.
-
-### Entitylist: the override list
-
-Some domains need to be unblocked when visiting another domain belonging to the same owner. E.g. we usually block "googleapis.com", but when visiting e.g. google.de,
-we unblock "googleapis.com". This is done in the entitylist: for every domain that belongs to a "property" in the entitylist, we unblock all domains listed in
-"resources".
-
-## Implementation
-
-WebView calls the WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest() callback every time a resource is to be loaded - this permits us to intercept resource loading, and is how we
-can perform content blocking on Android. (See [BlockListProcessor.java](../app/src/webkit/java/org/mozilla/focus/webkit/TrackingProtectionWebViewClient.java) ).
-
-We then just need to verify every resource URL to determine whether it can be loaded in that callback: we use a custom trie-based domain matching implementation for
-Focus for Android. This is different from Focus iOS: Focus for iOS was originally a content blocking safari plugin, and used the iOS content blocking API
-( https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Extensions/Conceptual/ContentBlockingRules/Introduction/Introduction.html ).
-That API uses a specific blocklist format, therefore firefox-ios converts the disconnect lists into the iOS format at build-time.
-
-Focus-ios browser was implemented later, and reuses the iOS content blocking list format (iOS webview was unable to make use of the content blocking API
-at that time, and therefore implemented its own URL matching). This is a regex based format: Focus-ios (browser) therefore stores a list of regexes, and iterates
-over that list to check whether a given resource URL matches. That approach means that focus-ios only needs one copy of the blocklists, however this isn't ideal for performance.
-
-As mentioned, Focus for Android uses a custom Trie implementation instead of iterating over regexes. This does mean that we aren't reusing iOS's blocklist
-format, but it also permits for ~140x faster domain lookup when compared to a port of the iOS domain lookup implementation. The entitylist is similar,
-and we use extended versions of the same Trie for the domain overrides. See [UrlMatcher](../app/src/webkit/java/org/mozilla/focus/webkit/matcher/UrlMatcher.java) for
-the actual matcher implementation.
-
-
-## Miscellaneous notes
-
-- We discard the site owners and names when parsing the blocklists, that makes it harder to keep track of which trackers have been blocked for a given site. That data would probably have to be added to the blocklist trie if we want a better breakdown of trackers.
-- Our Trie search is recursive, and uses a slightly silly "TrieString" to take care of string reversal and substrings. An iterative implementation would probably be better, and would avoid substrings. Such an implementation would be slightly more complex since we would have to keep track of string indexes, but reduces overhead. Given that current performance is acceptable, there isn't huge value in actually working on this.

-# Firefox Focus for Android
-
-## Telemetry
-
-For clients that have "send anonymous usage data" enabled Focus sends a "core" ping and an "event" ping to Mozilla's telemetry service. Sending telemetry can be disabled in the app's settings. Builds of "Focus for Android" have telemetry enabled by default ("opt-out") while builds of "Klar for Android" have telemetry disabled by default.
-
-### Core ping
-
-Focus for Android creates and tries to send a "core" ping whenever the app goes to the background. This core ping uses the same format as Firefox for Android and is [documented on readthedocs.io](https://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/data/core-ping.html).
-
-### Event ping
-
-In addition to the core ping an event ping for UI telemetry is generated and sent as soon as the app is sent to the background.
-
-#### Settings
-
-As part of the event ping the most recent state of the user's setting is sent (default values in **bold**):
-
-* Search engine selection (`pref_search_engine`: search engine identifier; *default value depends on user's locale*)
-* Block ad trackers (`pref_privacy_block_ads`: **true**/false)
-* Block analytics trackers (`pref_privacy_block_other`: true/**false**)
-* Block social trackers (`pref_privacy_block_social`: **true**/false)
-* Block content trackers (`pref_privacy_block_analytics`: **true**/false)
-* Block web fonts (`pref_performance_block_webfonts`: true/**false**)
-* Block images (`pref_performance_block_images`: true/**false**)
-* Locale override (`pref_locale`: **empty string**/<locale-code>). **empty string** indicates "System Default" locale is selected.
-* Focus is set as the default browser (`pref_default_browser`: true/**false**)
-
-#### Events
-
-The event ping contains a list of events ([see event format on readthedocs.io](http://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html)) for the following actions:
-
-* Start session - ("action", "foreground", "app")
-* Stop session - ("action", "background", "app")
-* (Browsing) URL entered: - ("action", "type_url", "search_bar")
-* (Browsing) Incoming normal browsing intent from third-party app - ("action", "intent_url", "app")
-* (Browsing) Incoming custom tab intent from third-party app - ("action", "intent_custom_tab", "app", options). Options is a list of enabled custom tab options as requested by the third-party app, e.g. [hasToolbarColor, hasCloseButton] etc.
-* (Browsing) Text selection action from third-party app ("action", "text_selection_intent", "app")
-* (Browsing) Long press on image or link, or image in link ("action", "long_press", "browser")
-* (CustomTab) Custom Tab close button clicked - ("action", "click", "custom_tab_close_but")
-* (CustomTab) Custom Tab action button clicked - ("action", "click", "custom_tab_action_bu")
-* (CustomTab) Browser Menu custom tab item selected - ("action", "open", "menu", "custom_tab")
-* (BrowserContextMenu) Context menu dismissed without any selection ("action", "cancel", "browser_contextmenu")
-* (BrowserContextMenu) Share Link menu item selected ("action", "share", "browser_contextmenu", "link")
-* (BrowserContextMenu) Copy link menu item selected ("action", "copy", "browser_contextmenu", "link")
-* (BrowserContextMenu) Share Image menu item selected ("action", "share", "browser_contextmenu", "image")
-* (BrowserContextMenu) Copy Image menu item selected ("action", "copy", "browser_contextmenu", "image")
-* (BrowserContextMenu) Save Image menu item selected ("action", "save", "browser_contextmenu", "image")
-* (Search) Query entered: - ("action", "type_query", "search_bar")
-* (Search) Query/Hint clicked: - ("action", "select_query", "search_bar")
-* (Erase) UI button clicked - ("action", "click", "erase_button")
-* (Erase) Device's back button pressed -> User goes back to home screen ("action", "click", "back_button", "erase_home")
-* (Erase) Device's back button pressed -> User goes back to third-party app ("action", "click", "back_button", "erase_app")
-* (Erase) Notification clicked - ("action", "click", "notification", "erase")
-* (Erase) Home screen shortcut clicked - ("action", "click", "shortcut", "erase")
-* Enable/Disable content blocking for session - ("action", "click", "blocking_switch", "true/false")
-* Notification: "Erase" action clicked: ("action", "click", "notification_action", "erase")
-* Notification: "Open" action clicked: ("action", "click", "notification_action", "open")
-* Setting changed: - ("action", "change", "settings", <key>, { "to": <value> })
-* Share URL with third-party app - ("action", "share", "menu")
-* Open default app for URL - ("action", "open", "menu", "default")
-* Open Firefox directly - ("action", "open", "menu", "firefox")
-* Open an app for this URL from a list of available apps - ("action", "open", "menu", "selection")
-* (Firstrun) Showing a first run page: ("action", "show", "firstrun", "<page>") (Page numbers start at 0. Initially when the firstrun tour is shown an event for the first page (0) is fired.
-* (Firstrun) Skip button is pressed: ("action", "click", "firstrun", "skip")
-* (Firstrun) Finish button on the last page of the tour is pressed: ("action", "click", "firstrun", "finish")
-
-#### Limits
-
-* An event ping will contain up to but no more than 500 events
-* No more than 40 pings per type (core/event) are stored on disk for upload at a later time
-* No more than 100 pings are sent per day
-
-### Implementation notes
-
-* Event pings are generated (and stored on disk) whenever the onStop() callback of the main activity is triggered. This happens whenever the main screen of the app is no longer visible (The app is in the background or another screen is displayed on top of the app).
-
-* Whenever we are storing pings we are also scheduling an upload. We are using Android’s JobScheduler API for that. This allows the system to run the background task whenever it is convenient and certain criterias are met. The only criteria we are specifying is that we require an active network connection. In most cases this job is executed immediately after the app is in the background.
-
-* Whenever an upload fails we are scheduling a retry. The first retry will happen after 30 seconds (or later if there’s no active network connection at this time). For further retries a exponential backoff policy is used: [30 seconds] * 2 ^ (num_failures - 1)
-
-* An earlier retry of the upload can happen whenever the app is coming to the foreground and sent to the background again (the previous scheduled job is reset and we are starting all over again).

-# Firefox Focus for Android
-
-## Updating translations
-
-Firefox Focus for Android is getting localized on [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/focus-for-android/).
-
-For converting between Android XML files and Gettext PO files (to be consumed by Pontoon) we use a local, slightly modified version of [android2po](https://github.com/miracle2k/android2po) (See `tools/l10n/android2po`).
-
-### Setup
-
-1. Python, Pip and Git need to be installed.
-
-1. Run the `stringsSetup` gradle tasks to create a local checkout of the L10N repository (in folder `l10n-repo`) and to install the python dependencies to run the l10n scripts:
-
-  ```shell
-  ./gradlew stringsSetup
-  ```
-
-### Export strings for translation
-
-1. Fetch the latest changes from the L10N repository and remove all local modifications with the `stringsCleanUpdate` gradle task:
-
-  ```shell
-  ./gradlew stringsCleanUpdate
-  ```
-
-1. Run the `stringsExport` gradle task to update the template and existing translations:
-
-  ```shell
-  ./gradlew stringsExport
-  ```
-  
-1. Create separate commits for every locale using the `stringsCommit` gradle task:
-
-  ```shell
-  ./gradlew stringsCommit
-  ```
-
-1. Go to the l10n-repo folder, verify the changes and push them to the L10N repository.
-
-### Import translated strings
-
-1. Fetch the latest changes from the L10N repository and remove all local modifications with the `stringsCleanUpdate` gradle task:
-
-  ```shell
-  ./gradlew stringsCleanUpdate
-  ```
-  
-1. Run the `stringsImport` gradle task to generate the Android XML files.
-
-  ```shell
