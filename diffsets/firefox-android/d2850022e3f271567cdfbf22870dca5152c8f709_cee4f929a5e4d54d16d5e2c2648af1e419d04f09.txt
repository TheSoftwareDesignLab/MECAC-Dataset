-## Meta Data
-(optional / if needed or relevant)
-Links to past feature documents. Past issues/bugs that might provide additional context.
-Links to dashboards or metrics for which the following document will be based on.
-
-## Problem Summary
-Talk about current goals of the system and how they aren't being met. What outcomes are we not delivering? This can also include an explicit request for improvement that doesn't dictate a specific or concrete solution.
-
-## What user problem(s) are we trying to resolve?
-
-[List of prioritized user stories using the syntax “So that … as a … I want ….”]
-
-### Assumptions (optional)
-This is where you talk about what you assume to be true. This could include assumptions around what users are doing, errors, gaps, etc., based on anecdotes, opinions, testing, or data.
-
-## Outcomes
-What are the outcomes you want to achieve? What is the success criteria?
-
-## Hypothesis
-A high level hypothesis of how the feature you're proposing is going help us achieve the outcomes listed above. I recommend this be a sentence of the form:
-
-If we (do this/build this/create this experiment) for (these users), then we will see (this outcome) because we have observed (this) via (data source, UR, survey).
-
-## Metrics
-
-- What is the primary success metric to confirm hypothesis?
-- Are there secondary success metrics which could potentially prevent this feature from rolling out?
-- How will these metrics be measured? (tool, data source, visualization, etc.) Make sure to confirm that these are confirmed before releasing.
-
-Please provide sample artifact graphs here.
-
-
-## Detailed design
-This is the bulk of the RFC.  Explain in enough detail to try to make it readable to someone outside of the team (other PMs, executives, etc) or for someone joining the team.
-An additional goal is to reduce any doubt within the interpretation of metrics we might collect.This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.
-
-### Original Version (Present Day)
-What is current situation in regards to this feature? How does it currently work? No need to go in as much detail as the suggested change but just enough to provide contrast and more context. Screenshots and user flow can often be enough.
-[Add screenshots]
-
-### Variation A
-Provide details of change. If this is one of multiple variations, why do we think this change will make the better improvement. Include:
-Screenshots with appropriate explanation
-User flow
-
-### Variation B (if necessary)
-(Same details as variation A)
-
-## Hypothetical Implementation Plan
-
-Unresolved questions and risks (optional)
-What parts of the design are still TBD?
-
-
-## Results
-- If we are developing a hypothesis and defining success metrics, we need to log them here.
-- If metrics leave room to interpretation, define them. (e.g. when are they tracked, how, etc)
-- Include screenshots of result graphs or data tables
-- These results will likely help us develop new hypotheses.
-
-
-## Conclusion
-Was our hypothesis true or false and why?
-Our hypothesis was true because we observed... [e.g. a 15% increase in account signup completions].
-
-We should also address secondary metrics here:
-We also observed during this test that…  [e.g. we had an increase in single device signups]
-
-## Next Steps
-There no point having a conclusion if you don’t have take-aways with next steps.
-
-Are we releasing? Are we making changes?

-## Overview ##
-Code freeze for a milestone is the *second Friday of the sprint*, and most of releng happens between *Monday and and Thursday (of the next milestone)*, with the *Beta release Thursday*. Beta should be promoted to Release on the release date. String freeze is the *first Thursday* of the sprint, but can be pushed to the *second Wednesday* of the sprint if cleared with Delphine/L10N.
-
-## Sprint start [1st week of milestone]
-
-- [ ] Update versionName in build.gradle for the next milestone (preliminary version number)
-
-## String freeze and string Export [Thursday, 1st week of milestone]
-- [ ] Make sure the "Final string Import" from the previous release has already happened. (Check with the RM from the last release if it was not been checked off) This is to prevent string changes (mainly changes or deletions) from the this release from getting translated and included in the string import for the previous release (where the feature set is different, and the linter will fail).
-- [ ] Make sure all issues with label "strings needed" have strings assigned and the label updated to "strings approved"
-- [ ] Pre-land all strings for features that have not been implemented yet
-- [ ] Export strings and open PR in the L10N repository
-- [ ] If there are strings that haven't been pre-landed, land them **no later** than *second Wednesday* of the sprint and give a heads up to Delphine
-
-## Feature complete [Monday, 1st week of next milestone]
-
-- [ ] Create a branch for the *current* milestone and protect it through Settings on the repo (need admin privileges). After that `main` is tracking the next milestone. Usually done on the Monday after feature complete on Friday.
-- [ ] Create an issue in the *upcoming* milestone: "What's New Entry for [release]" to track work for the SUMO page ([example](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1670)).
-- [ ] [Create an issue](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/new?template=release_checklist_template.md&title=Releng+for+) in the *upcoming* milestone: "Releng for [release]" and copy this checklist into it. Assign the next assignee.
-- [ ] Go through the list of bugs closed during this sprint and make sure all they're all added to the correct milestone.
-- [ ] Make sure new What's New Link is updated in SupportUtils for release
-- [ ] Add either `ReadyForQA` or `QANotNeeded` flags on each of the bugs in the current milestone.
-
-## Final string Import [Wednesday, 1st week of next milestone]
-- [ ] Cherry pick any new string import commits from `main` into the release branch
-
-## Beta Submission [Thursday, 1st week of next milestone]
-
-- [ ] Tag first RC version in Github. For 1.0 the tag would be v1.0-RC1. This will kick off a build of the branch. The format for the Taskcluster task is `https://github.taskcluster.net/v1/repository/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/<milestone-branch>/latest`, or you can see it in the mouseover of the CI badge of the branch in the commits view.
-
-    If you need to trigger a new RC build, you need to draft a publish a new (pre-release) release. Editing an existing release and creating a new tag will not trigger a new RC build.
-
-- [ ] Create a [Bugzilla bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=__default__&product=Release%20Engineering&cloned_bug_id=1408386) for signing and uploading the builds [Friday after code release]. Include the planned dates for Beta and Release release, from the [train schedule](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Focus/Android/Train_Schedule).
-- [ ] Let release engineering sign the builds and upload the signed builds to Bugzilla
-- [ ] Let release management upload the builds to the Alpha channel (internal distribution)
-- [ ] If the builds passed a smoke test let release management promote the build to the beta channel (public distribution)
-- [ ] Upload the APK to the [releases page](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/releases).
-- [ ] Upload the APK to archive.mozilla.org into a folder with the name of the version (e.g. /android/focus/2.2-RC1) (S3 bucket)
-
-## During Beta
-
-- [ ] Check Google Play for new crashes. File issues and triage.
-- [ ] If bugs are considered release blocker then fix them on `main` and the milestone branch (cherry-pick / uplift)
-- [ ] If needed tag a new RC version (e.g. v1.0-RC2) and follow the submission checklist again.
-
-## Release
-
-- [ ] Release management promotes the build from beta to the release channel. For minor releases this can happen at any time during the day. Major releases often need to be synchronized with other marketing activities (e.g. blog postings). Releases are rolled out to 99% of the population (otherwise the rollout can't be stopped).
-
-## After the release
-
-- [ ] After some days release management sets the roll out to 100%
-- [ ] Check whether there are new crashes that need to be filed.
-- [ ] Tag the last and released RC version additionally with the tag of the release (v1.0-RC2 -> v1.0)
-- [ ] Upload signed APKs to the [release page](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/releases)
-- [ ] Upload the APK to http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/android/focus/ (S3 bucket) into a folder named like a release (e.g. /android/focus/2.2). Builds from the "latest" folder are linked from the mozilla.org website.
-
-```
-aws configure
-aws s3 cp <klar-or-focus-apk-path> s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/android/<new-version>/
-```
-Also replace the APKs in /android/focus/latest/. Builds from the "latest" folder are linked from the mozilla.org website.
