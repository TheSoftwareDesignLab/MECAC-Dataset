+#### Headings
+
+One of the many navigation modes provided by TalkBack is that of "Heading". This mode allows the user to jump to different section of the screen utilizing the heading of that area. This functionality was introduced in Android Pie and it can be enabled by putting the `android:accessibilityHeading="true"` on the element that needs to become a heading. If the min sdk is less than 28 then this can be enabled using the `AccessibilityDelegate`. 
+
+```java
+public static void enableAccessibilityHeading(@NonNull View view) {
+        setAccessibilityDelegateSafely(view, new AccessibilityDelegateCompat() {
+            @Override public void onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(View host, AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat info) {
+                super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info);
+                info.setHeading(true);
+            }
+        });
+    }
+```
