+#. translators: Warning: this is the OLD copy for the `play_store_desc` key. It is not used anymore, so strictly speaking, does not need to be translated in practice.
+#. This old source will only be kept around for a short time, the only goal being to keep the "translation memory" for this old copy around, to help while the new copy is translated (since the shorter, new copy has many common paragraphs with the old one here).
+#. The diff between the source of the old copy (this one) and the new one (in `play_store_desc`) can be seen in https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/pull/17069/files#diff-627fbef511dc257b5ecf6b9029883b713870ff46a6327c7050bfb82d7af27c03
+#. This key for the old copy will be removed once the new copy have translations for all locales in this project.

+"Why WordPress?\n"
+"\n"
+"There are a lot of blogging services, website builders, and social networks out there. Why create your website with WordPress?\n"
+"\n"
+"WordPress powers over a third of the web. It’s used by hobby blogs, businesses of all sizes, online stores, even the biggest news sites on the internet. Odds are that many of your favorite websites are running on WordPress.\n"
+"\n"
+"With WordPress, you own your own content.  Other social networks treat you as a commodity, and assume ownership of the content you post. But with WordPress anything you publish is yours, and you can take it with you wherever you’d like.\n"
+"\n"
+"WordPress is an open source website creator, meaning anyone can see how it's made, and even contribute.  Other services and social networks are proprietary, closed systems; you can never be sure exactly how they work or what they are doing -- and they can disappear!\n"
+"\n"
+"Whether you need a website builder to create your website, or a simple blog maker, WordPress can help. It gives you beautiful designs, powerful features, and the freedom to build anything you want.\n"
+"\n"
+"WordPress for Android supports self-hosted sites running WordPress 4.0 and later, and all sites at WordPress.com. Just like WordPress, WordPress for Android is open source.
