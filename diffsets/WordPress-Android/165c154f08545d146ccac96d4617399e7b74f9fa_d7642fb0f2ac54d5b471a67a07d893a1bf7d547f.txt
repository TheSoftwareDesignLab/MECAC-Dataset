 There might be times when a custom view such as a chart might not be accessible in no shape or form. This is how the `ExploreByTouchHelper` comes into play. This component allows virtual accessibility views to be created that intercepts touch events to trigger TalkBack announcements. It does this by hooking into a view once it has been drawn and creates virtual views using the `Rect` of the actual views. Since it's simply a super `AccessibilityDelegate` these views can be customized with `contentDescriptions` and `actions` when they become focused.

 There are several views and UI patterns that involve views that appear for a limited to show something to the user. The most common ones are `Toasts` and `Snackbars`. These components already have accessibility support built in. However, the `SnackBar` behavior has to be extended to be more accessible. 
-In this codebase, the `WPSnackBar` component has functionality that detects if the accessibility services are enabled and extends the time that the `SnackBar` is visible. This allows the user to interact with the actions that are present on the `SnackBar` before it disappears. Another component that is worth mentioning is the play/pause controls on a media component. Normally, they disappear and the user would tap the screen for them to reappear but in the case of TalkBack usage it would be best to make them remain on the screen permanently. The guiding principles for views of this nature are:

The guiding principles for views of this nature are: 
 
 * Ensure that the views that are appearing for a limited time, are either extended or have an indefinite time. 
 * The actions that are present on these views should be available in other areas of the app, so that if the view disappears the user still has means of triggering the functionality elsewhere.
