+     * Updates the data for the adapter while retaining visible item in certain cases.
+     *
+     * PagedList tries to keep the visible item by adding new items outside of the screen while modifying the scroll
+     * position. In most cases, this works out great because it doesn't interrupt to the user. However, after a new
+     * item is inserted at the top while the list is showing the very first items, it feels very weird to not have the
+     * inserted item shown. For example, if a new draft is added there is no indication of it except for the flash
+     * of the scroll bar which is not noticeable unless user is paying attention to it.
+     *
+     * In these cases, we try to keep the scroll position the same instead of keeping the visible item the same by
+     * first saving the state and re-applying it after the data updates are completed. Since `PagedListAdapter` uses
+     * bg thread to calculate the changes, we need to post the change in the bg thread as well so that it'll be applied
+     * after changes are reflected.
