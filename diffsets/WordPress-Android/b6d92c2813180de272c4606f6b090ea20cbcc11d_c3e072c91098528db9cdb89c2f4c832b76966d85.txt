By contrast, the\n    GNU General Public License is\n    intended to guarantee your freedom to\n    share and change free\n    software--to make sure the software is free for\n    all its users. This\n    General Public License applies to most of the\n    Free Software\n    Foundation\'s software and to any other program whose\n    authors commit\n    to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation\n    software is\n    covered by the GNU Library General Public License\n    instead.) You can\n    apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of\n    free software,\n    we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\n    Public Licenses\n    are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\n    to distribute\n    copies of free software (and charge for this service if\n    you wish),\n    that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\n    that you\n    can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\n    programs;\n    and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect\n    your\n    rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n    you\n    these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor\n    example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you\n    have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n    source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\n    rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the\n    software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso,\n    for each author\'s protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n    everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\n    we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the\n    original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect\n    on the original authors\' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program\n    is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the\n    danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\n    obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To\n    prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed\n    for everyone\'s free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise\n    terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n    follow.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR\n    COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to\n    any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the\n    copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n    this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any\n    such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either\n    the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to\n    say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\n    in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as\n    "you".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and\n    modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its\n    scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the\n    output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a\n    work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n    running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the\n    Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of\n    the Program\'s source code as you receive it, in any medium,\n    provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each\n    copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\n    keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the\n    absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n    Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may\n    charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you\n    may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any\n    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy\n    and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section\n    1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na)\n    You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You\n    must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\n    to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under\n    the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally\n    reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when\n    started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way,\n    to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\n    copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else,\n    saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view\n    a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is\n    interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your\n    work based on the Program is not required to print an\n    announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a\n    whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from\n    the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and\n    separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do\n    not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n    works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\n    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole\n    must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other\n    licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\n    part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this\n    section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written\n    entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to\n    control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n    the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not\n    based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the\n    Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not\n    bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may\n    copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\n    following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the\n    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for\n    software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer,\n    valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a\n    charge no more than your cost of physically performing source\n    distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\n    source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\n    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;\n    or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the\n    offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received\n    the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n    accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means\n    the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For\n    an executable work, complete source code means all the source code\n    for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\n    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the\n    source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n    the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is\n    made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\n    offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same\n    place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\n    parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object\n    code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the\n    Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt\n    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\n    License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from\n    you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n    long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not\n    required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute\n    the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by\n    law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\n    distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you\n    indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms\n    and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or\n    works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or\n    any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives\n    a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\n    the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not\n    impose any further restrictions on the recipients\' exercise of the\n    rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\n    compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a\n    consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\n    or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n    are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\n    that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\n    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so\n    as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license\n    would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all\n    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion\n    of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n    circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce\n    you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to\n    contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole\n    purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n    distribution system, which is implemented by public license\n    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide\n    range of software distributed through that system in reliance on\n    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor\n    to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any\n    other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis\n    section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n    a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution\n    and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either\n    by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\n    holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n    geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\n    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as\n    if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software\n    Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General\n    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\n    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n    address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a\n    distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version\n    number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",\n    you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this\n    License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\n    Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the\n    Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are\n    different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software\n    which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the\n    Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\n    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free\n    status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the\n    sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11.\n    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\n    WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\n    PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n    PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN\n    NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE\n    OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH\n    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n  </string>

Ezzel szemben a GNU GPL célja, hogy garantálja a szabad szoftver másolásának és terjesztésének szabadságát, ezáltal biztosítva a szoftver szabad felhasználhatóságát minden felhasználó számára. A GPL szabályai vonatkoznak a Free Software Foundation legtöbb szoftverére, illetve minden olyan programra, melynek szerzője úgy dönt, hogy ezt használja a szerzői jog megjelölésekor. (A Free Software Foundation egyes szoftvereire a GNU LGPL érvényes.) Bárki használhatja a programjaiban a GPL-t a szerzői jogi megjegyzésnél.\n\nA szabad szoftver megjelölés nem jelenti azt, hogy a szoftvernek nem lehet ára. A GPL licencek célja, hogy garantálja a szabad szoftver másolatainak szabad terjesztését (és e szolgáltatásért akár díj felszámítását), a forráskód elérhetőségét, hogy bárki szabadon módosíthassa a szoftvert, vagy felhasználhassa a részeit új szabad programokban; és hogy mások megismerhessék ezt a lehetőséget.\n\nA szerző jogainak védelmében korlátozásokat kell hozni, amelyek megtiltják, hogy bárki megtagadhassa ezeket a jogokat másoktól, vagy ezekről való lemondásra kényszerítsen bárki mást. Ezek a megszorítások bizonyos felelősségeket jelentenek azok számára, akik a szoftver másolatait terjesztik vagy módosítják.\n\nHa valaki például ilyen program másolatait terjeszti, akár ingyen vagy bizonyos összeg fejében, a szoftverre vonatkozó minden jogot tovább kell adnia a fogadó feleknek. Biztosítani kell továbbá, hogy megkapják vagy legalábbis megkaphassák a forráskódot is. És persze ezeket a licencfeltételeket is el kell juttatni, hogy tisztában legyenek a jogaikkal.\n\nA jogok védelme két lépésből áll:\n\n(1) a szoftver szerzői jogainak védelméből és\n\n(2) a jelen licenc biztosításából, amely jogalapot biztosít a szoftver másolására, terjesztésére és/vagy módosítására.\n\nAz egyes szerzők és a magunk védelmében biztosítani akarjuk, hogy mindenki megértse: a jelen szabad szoftverre nincs jótállás. Ha a szoftvert módosították és továbbadták, akkor mindenkinek, aki a módosított változatot kapja, tudnia kell, hogy az nem az eredeti, így a mások által okozott hibáknak nem lehet hatása az eredeti szerző hírnevére.\n\nVégül, a szabad szoftver létét állandóan fenyegetik a szoftverszabadalmak. El szeretnénk kerülni annak veszélyét, hogy a szabad program terjesztői szabadalmat jegyezhessenek be rá, ezáltal saját szellemi tulajdont képezővé tegyék a programot. Ennek megelőzéséhez tisztázni kívánjuk: szabadalom szabad szoftverrel kapcsolatban csak mindenki általi szabad használatra jegyezhető be, vagy egyáltalán nem jegyezhető be.\n\nA másolásra, terjesztésre, módosításra vonatkozó pontos szabályok és feltételek:\nA MÁSOLÁSRA, TERJESZTÉSRE ÉS MÓDOSÍTÁSRA VONATKOZÓ FELTÉTELEK ÉS KIKÖTÉSEK\n\n0. Ez a licenc minden olyan programra vagy munkára vonatkozik, amelynek a szerzői jogi megjegyzésében a jog tulajdonosa a következő szöveget helyezte el: a GPL-ben foglaltak alapján terjeszthető. Az alábbiakban a Program kifejezés bármely ilyen programra vagy munkára vonatkozik, a Programon alapuló munka pedig magát a programot vagy egy szerzői joggal védett munkát jelenti: vagyis olyan munkát, amely tartalmazza a programot vagy annak egy részletét, módosítottan vagy módosítatlanul és/vagy más nyelvre fordítva. (Az alábbiakban a fordítás minden egyéb megkötés nélkül beletartozik a módosítás fogalmába.) Minden engedélyezés címzettje Ön.\n\nA jelen licenc a másoláson, terjesztésen és módosításon kívül más tevékenységre nem vonatkozik, azok a hatályán kívül esnek. A Program futtatása nincs korlátozva, illetve a Program kimenetére is csak abban az esetben vonatkozik ez a szabályozás, ha az tartalmazza a Programon alapuló munka egy részletét (függetlenül attól, hogy ez a Program futtatásával jött-e létre). Ez tehát a Program működésétől függ.\n\n1. A Program forráskódja módosítás nélkül másolható és bármely adathordozón terjeszthető, feltéve, hogy minden egyes példányon pontosan szerepel a megfelelő szerzői jogi megjegyzés, illetve a garanciavállalás elutasítása; érintetlenül kell hagyni minden erre a szabályozásra és a garancia teljes hiányára utaló szöveget és a jelen licencdokumentumot is el kell juttatni mindazokhoz, akik a Programot kapják.\n\nFelszámítható díj a másolat fizikai továbbítása fejében, illetve ellenszolgáltatás fejében a Programhoz garanciális támogatás is biztosítható.\n\n2. A Program vagy annak egy része módosítható, így a Programon alapuló munka jön létre. A módosítás ezután az 1. szakaszban adott feltételek szerint tovább terjeszthető, ha az alábbi feltételek is teljesülnek:\n\n    a) A módosított fájlokat el kell látni olyan megjegyzéssel, amely feltünteti a módosítást végző nevét és a módosítások dátumát. \n\n    b) Minden olyan munkát, amely részben vagy egészben tartalmazza a Programot vagy a Programon alapul, olyan szabályokkal kell kiadni vagy terjeszteni, hogy annak használati joga harmadik személy részére licencdíjmentesen hozzáférhető legyen, a jelen dokumentumban található feltételeknek megfelelően. \n\n    c) Ha a módosított Program interaktívan olvassa a parancsokat futás közben, akkor úgy kell elkészíteni, hogy a megszokott módon történő indításkor megjelenítsen egy üzenetet a megfelelő szerzői jogi megjegyzéssel és a garancia hiányára utaló közléssel (vagy éppen azzal az információval, hogy miként juthat valaki garanciához), illetve azzal az információval, hogy bárki terjesztheti a Programot a jelen feltételeknek megfelelően, és arra is utalást kell tenni, hogy a felhasználó miként tekintheti meg a licenc egy példányát. (Kivétel: ha a Program interaktív ugyan, de nem jelenít meg hasonló üzenetet, akkor a Programon alapuló munkának sem kell ezt tennie.) \n\nEzek a feltételek a módosított munkára, mint egészre vonatkoznak. Ha a munka azonosítható részei nem a Programon alapulnak és független munkákként elkülönülten azonosíthatók, akkor ez a szabályozás nem vonatkozik ezekre a részekre, ha azok külön munkaként kerülnek terjesztésre. Viszont, ha ugyanez a rész az egész részeként kerül terjesztésre, amely a Programon alapuló munka, akkor az egész terjesztése csak a jelen dokumentum alapján lehetséges, amely ebben az esetben a jogokat minden egyes felhasználó számára kiterjeszti az egészre tekintet nélkül arra, hogy melyik részt ki írta.\n\nE szövegrésznek tehát nem az a célja, hogy mások jogait elvegye vagy korlátozza a kizárólag saját maga által írt munkákra; a cél az, hogy a jogok gyakorlása szabályozva legyen a Programon alapuló illetve a gyűjteményes munkák terjesztése esetében.\n\nEzenkívül más munkáknak, amelyek nem a Programon alapulnak, a Programmal (vagy a Programon alapuló munkával) közös adathordozón vagy adattárolón szerepeltetése nem jelenti a jelen szabályok érvényességét azokra is.\n\n3. A Program (vagy a Programon alapuló munka a 2. szakasznak megfelelően) másolható és terjeszthető tárgykódú vagy végrehajtható kódú formájában az 1. és 2. szakaszban foglaltak szerint, amennyiben az alábbi feltételek is teljesülnek:\n\n    a) a teljes, gép által értelmezhető forráskód kíséri az anyagot, amelynek terjesztése az 1. és 2. szakaszban foglaltak szerint történik, jellemzően szoftverterjesztésre használt adathordozón; vagy, \n\n    b) legalább három évre szólóan írásban vállalja, hogy bármely külső személynek rendelkezésre áll a teljes gép által értelmezhető forráskód, a fizikai továbbítást fedező összegnél nem nagyobb díjért az 1. és 2. szakaszban foglaltak szerint szoftverterjesztésre használt adathordozón; vagy,\n\n    c) a megfelelő forráskód terjesztésére vonatkozóan megkapott tájékoztatás kíséri az anyagot. (Ez az alternatíva csak nem kereskedelmi terjesztés esetén alkalmazható abban az esetben, ha a terjesztő a Programhoz a tárgykódú vagy forráskódú formájában jutott hozzá az ajánlattal együtt a fenti b. cikkelynek megfelelően.) \n\nEgy munka forráskódja a munkának azt a formáját jelenti, amelyben a módosításokat elsődlegesen végezni szokás. Egy végrehajtható program esetében a teljes forráskód a tartalmazott összes modul forráskódját jelenti, továbbá a kapcsolódó felületdefiníciós fájlokat és a fordítást vezérlő parancsfájlokat. Egy speciális kivételként a forráskódnak nem kell tartalmaznia normál esetben a végrehajtható kód futtatására szolgáló operációs rendszer főbb részeiként (kernel, fordítóprogram stb.) terjesztett részeit (forrás vagy bináris formában), kivéve, ha a komponens maga a végrehajtható állományt kíséri.\n\nHa a végrehajtható program vagy tárgykód terjesztése a forráskód hozzáférését egy megadott helyen biztosító írásban vállalja, akkor ez egyenértékű a forráskód terjesztésével, bár másoknak nem kell a forrást lemásolniuk a tárgykóddal együtt.\n\n4. A Programot csak a jelen Licencben leírtaknak megfelelően szabad lemásolni, terjeszteni, módosítani és allicencbe adni. Az egyéb módon történő másolás, módosítás, terjesztés és allicencbe adás érvénytelen, és azonnal érvényteleníti a dokumentumban megadott jogosultságokat. Mindazonáltal azok, akik a Licencet megszegőtől kaptak példányokat vagy jogokat, tovább gyakorolhatják a Licenc által meghatározott jogaikat mindaddig, amíg teljesen megfelelnek a Licenc feltételeinek.\n\n5. Önnek nem kötelező elfogadnia ezt a szabályozást, hiszen nem írta alá. Ezen kívül viszont semmi más nem ad jogokat a Program terjesztésére és módosítására. Ezeket a cselekedeteket a törvény bünteti, ha nem a jelen szerzői jogi szabályozás keretei között történnek. Mindezek miatt a Program (vagy a Programon alapuló munka) terjesztése vagy módosítása a jelen dokumentum szabályainak, és azon belül a Program vagy a munka módosítására, másolására vagy terjesztésére vonatkozó összes feltételének elfogadását jelenti.\n\n6. Minden alkalommal, amikor a Program (vagy az azon alapuló munka) továbbadása történik, a Programot megkapó személy automatikusan hozzájut az eredeti licenctulajdonostól származó licenchez, amely a jelen szabályok szerint biztosítja a jogot a Program másolására, terjesztésére és módosítására. Nem lehet semmilyen módon tovább korlátozni a fogadó félnek az itt megadott jogait. A Program továbbadója nem felelős harmadik személyekkel betartatni a jelen szabályokat.\n\n7. Ha bírósági határozat, szabadalomsértés vélelme, vagy egyéb (nem kizárólag szabadalmakkal kapcsolatos) okból olyan feltételeknek kell megfelelnie (akár bírósági határozat, akár megállapodás, akár bármi más eredményeképp), amelyek ellentétesek a jelen feltételekkel, az nem menti fel a terjesztőt a jelen feltételek figyelembevétele alól. Ha a terjesztés nem lehetséges a jelen Licenc és az egyéb feltételek kötelezettségeinek együttes betartásával, akkor tilos a Program terjesztése. Ha például egy szabadalmi szerződés nem engedi meg egy program jogdíj nélküli továbbterjesztését azok számára, akik közvetve vagy közvetlenül megkapják, akkor az egyetlen módja, hogy eleget tegyen valaki mindkét feltételnek az, hogy eláll a Program terjesztésétől.\n\nHa ennek a szakasznak bármely része érvénytelen, vagy nem érvényesíthető valamely körülmény folytán, akkor a szakasz maradék részét kell alkalmazni, egyéb esetekben pedig a szakasz egésze alkalmazandó.\n\nEnnek a szakasznak nem az a célja, hogy a szabadalmak vagy egyéb hasonló jogok megsértésére ösztönözzön bárkit is; mindössze meg szeretné védeni a szabad szoftver terjesztési rendszerének egységét, amelyet a szabad közreadást szabályozó feltételrendszerek teremtenek meg. Sok ember nagymértékben járult hozzá az e rendszer keretében terjesztett, különféle szoftverekhez, és számít a rendszer következetes alkalmazására; azt a szerző/adományozó dönti el, hogy a szoftverét más rendszer szerint is közzé kívánja-e tenni, és a licencet kapók ezt nem befolyásolhatják.\n\nE szakasz célja, hogy pontosan tisztázza azt, ami elgondolásunk szerint a jelen licenc többi részének a következménye.\n\n8. Ha a Program terjesztése és/vagy használata egyes országokban nem lehetséges akár szabadalmak, akár szerzői jogokkal védett felületek miatt, akkor a Program szerzői jogainak eredeti tulajdonosa, aki a Programot ezen szabályozás alapján adja közre, egy explicit földrajzi megkötést adhat a terjesztésre, és egyes országokat kizárhat. Ebben az esetben úgy tekintendő, hogy a jelen licenc ezt a megkötést is tartalmazza, ugyanúgy mintha csak a fő szövegében lenne leírva.\n\n9. A Free Software Foundation időről időre kiadja a General Public License dokumentum felülvizsgált és/vagy újabb változatait. Ezek az újabb dokumentumok az előzőek szellemében készülnek, de részletekben különbözhetnek, hogy új problémákat vagy aggályokat is kezeljenek.\n\nA dokumentum minden változata egy megkülönböztető verziószámmal ellátva jelenik meg. Ha a Program szerzői jogi megjegyzésében egy bizonyos vagy annál újabb verzió van megjelölve, akkor lehetőség van akár a megjelölt, vagy a Free Software Foundation által kiadott későbbi verzióban leírt feltételek követésére. Ha nincs ilyen megjelölt verzió, akkor lehetőség van a Free Software Foundation által valaha kibocsátott bármelyik dokumentum alkalmazására.\n\n10. A Programot más szabad szoftverbe, amelynek szerzői jogi szabályozása különbözik, csak akkor építheti be, ha a szerzőtől erre engedélyt szerzett. Abban az esetben, ha a program szerzői jogainak tulajdonosa a Free Software Foundation, akkor a Free Software Foundation címére kell írni; néha kivételt teszünk. A döntés a következő két cél szem előtt tartásával fog történni: megmaradjon a szabad szoftveren alapuló munkák szabad állapota, valamint segítse elő a szoftver újrafelhasználását és megosztását.\nGARANCIAVÁLLALÁS HIÁNYA\n\n11.
