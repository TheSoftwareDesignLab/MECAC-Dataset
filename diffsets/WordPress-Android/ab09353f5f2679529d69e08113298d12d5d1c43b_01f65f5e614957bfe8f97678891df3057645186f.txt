+## Adding a new test?
+
+Great! When adding a new UI test, consider:
+
+* Whether you need to test a user flow (to accomplish a task or goal) or a specific feature (e.g. boundary testing).
+* What screens/pages are being tested(defined in `pages/`).
+* What user flows are being used(defined in `flows/`).
+* Any specific UI components being interacted with?(defined in `components/`).
+* What network requests are made during the test (defined in the `WordPressMocks` repo).
+
+It's preferred to focus UI tests on entire user flows, and group tests with related flows or goals in the same test file.
+
+When you add a new test, you may need to add new screens, methods, and flows, when writing these I encourage to check 
+`support/WPSupportUtils.java` for additional code to reuse to automating the task. Our tests are also used to generate screenshots
+and a lot of useful helper functions are made available through that auxillary file. Wherever possible, avoid the use
+ of a string to select a UI element on the screen, the use of other identifiers such as id or content description is preferable 
+  and should be used where possible, even if that means adding it to a UI element that might be missing the appropriate field.
+   This ensures tests can be run regardless of the device language.
+   
+## Adding or updating network mocks
+
+When you add a test (or when the app changes), the request definitions for WireMock need to be updated. You can read WireMock’s documentation [here](http://wiremock.org/docs/).
+
+If you are unsure what network requests need to be mocked for a test, an easy way to find out is to run the app through [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) and observe the required requests.
+
+`WordPressMocks` is included as a library in `WordPress-Android` and are located in `libs/mocks/WordPressMocks/`, you can update 
+your local mock files and make changes here. Additionally a pull request updating the mocks 
+here should have an accompanying pull request to the `WordPressMocks` repo so that the mocks can be shared across the platforms.
