+## UI tests Overview
+
+WordPress for Android has UI acceptance tests for critical user flows through the app, such as login, 
+signup, and publishing. The tests use mocked network requests with [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/), 
+defined in [WordPressMocks](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPressMocks).
+
+## Running the tests 
+
+**Note that due to the mock server setup, tests cannot be run on physical devices right now.**
+
+
+1. Follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android#build-instructions)
+ (steps 1-7) to clone, build and run the project in Android Studio.
