 #### Touch Targets
-Be sure to check for insufficient touch targets on a screen. An element that’s touch enabled should at least 48dp x 48dp. 
-
-For views where you don’t want to modify the padding you can utilize the [TouchDelegate](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/TouchDelegate) functionality where you are able to get the current “Hit Rect) which is a rect with the current bounds and you are able to modify it to increase the touch area. 
+Sometimes people have difficulty when attempting to select views with small touch targets on the  screen. 
+Be sure to check for insufficient touch targets using the tools available. You can utilize the layout bounds functionality in Developer Options to see the current touch target size. 
+Enable developer options by going to Settings > System > Developer Options. Under the Drawing section, selected "Show layout bounds" and turn it on. Your screen should now show the bounds & margins of every visible view on the screen. For touch targets : 
+ 
+ * Each element that’s touch enabled should have at least 48dp x 48dp in size. 
+ * Easiest way to increase this is to utilize the `padding` attribute. 
+ * For views where you don’t want to modify the padding you can utilize the [TouchDelegate](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/TouchDelegate) functionality where you are able to get the current “Hit Rect) which is a rect with the current bounds and you are able to modify it to increase the touch area. There is a function within `ViewUtils` that does this well.
