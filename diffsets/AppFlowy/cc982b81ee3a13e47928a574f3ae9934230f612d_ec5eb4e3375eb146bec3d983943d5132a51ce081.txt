Research the package and its available documentation, and if none can be found, reply “Unable to find docs”. Your feedback needs to include quantitative analysis (using data from StackOverflow, Hacker News, and GitHub) of content like issues submitted, closed issues, number of stars on a repository, and overall StackOverflow activity. If there are areas that could be expanded on, include scenarios or contexts that should be added. Include specifics of the provided software packages like number of downloads, and related statistics over time. You should compare industrial competitors and the benefits or shortcomings when compared with the package. Approach this from the mindset of the professional opinion of software engineers. Review technical blogs and websites (such as TechCrunch.com or Crunchbase.com) and if data isn’t available, reply “No data available”.",
