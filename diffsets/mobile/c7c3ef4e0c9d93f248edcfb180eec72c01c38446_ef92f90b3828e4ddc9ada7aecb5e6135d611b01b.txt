 We're using the standard way of internationalising our app, as desbribed in the
 [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization#setting-up).
 
-What is specific to this project is the way we produce the template `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` file.
+What is specific to this project is the way we produce the ARB files.
 
-This file is generated by a script: `scripts/update-arb-from-crowdin.mjs` that fetches lichess translations from the [crowdin lichess project](https://crowdin.com/project/lichess).
+Lichess translations are managed in [crowdin lichess project](https://crowdin.com/project/lichess).
 
-## How to update the translations
+Crowdin translations (and sources) are located in the `translation/` directory. New
+translations are regularly fetched from crowdin by a github action.
 
-There is a script that fetches the translations from crowdin and updates the `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` file.
+We generate ARB files with a script that processes these translations: `scripts/gen-arb.mjs`.
 
-This file must not be edited manually, as it will be overwritten by the script.
+Then a flutter command is used to generate the dart files from the ARB files:
 
-To update the translations, run the following commands:
+So, in order to update the dart files we need to run:
 
 ```bash
-./scripts/update-arb-from-crowdin.mjs
+./scripts/gen-arb.mjs
 flutter gen-l10n
 ```
 
-If the script does nothing (no changes), it means that the translations from the
-last crowdin export are already up to date.

-The list of modules we're using in the app is defined in the `scripts/update-arb-from-crowdin.mjs` script.
+We can edit this file to add new translations that are specific to the mobile

+file.

+All the other modules comes from [lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/tree/master/translation/source) repository. They are pulled from crowdin and should **NOT** be edited.
+We are not using all the lila modules, and the list of modules is defined in the
