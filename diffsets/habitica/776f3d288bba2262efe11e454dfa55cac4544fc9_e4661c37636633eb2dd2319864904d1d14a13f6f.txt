   "questButterflyText": "Bye, Bye, Butterfry",
   "questButterflyNotes": "Your gardener friend @Megan sends you an invitation: “These warm days are the perfect time to visit Habitica’s butterfly garden in the Taskan countryside. Come see the butterflies migrate!” When you arrive, however, the garden is in shambles -- little more than scorched grass and dried-out weeds. It’s been so hot that the Habiticans haven’t come out to water the flowers, and the dark-red Dailies have turned it into a dry, sun-baked, fire-hazard. There's only one butterfly there, and there's something odd about it...<br><br>“Oh no! This is the perfect hatching ground for the Flaming Butterfry,” cries @Leephon.<br><br>“If we don’t catch it, it’ll destroy everything!” gasps @Eevachu.<br><br>Time to say bye, bye to Butterfry!",
-  "questButterflyCompletion": "After a blazing battle, the Flaming Butterfry is captured. “Great job catching the that would-be arsonist,” says @Megan with a sigh of relief. “Still, it’s hard to vilify even the vilest butterfly. We’d better free this Butterfry someplace safe…like the desert.”<br><br>One of the other gardeners, @Beffymaroo, comes up to you, singed but smiling. “Will you help raise these foundling chrysalises we found? Perhaps next year we’ll have a greener garden for them.”",
