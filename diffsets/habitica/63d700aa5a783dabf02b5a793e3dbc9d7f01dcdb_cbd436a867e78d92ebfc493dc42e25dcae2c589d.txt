-    "commGuidePara002": "To help keep everyone safe, happy, and productive in the community, we have some guidelines. We have carefully crafted them to make them as friendly and easy-to-read as possible. Please take the time to read them.",
-    "commGuidePara003": "These rules apply to all of the social spaces we use, including (but not necessarily limited to) Trello, GitHub, Transifex, and the Wikia (aka wiki). Sometimes, unforeseen situations will arise, like a new source of conflict or a vicious necromancer. When this happens, the mods may respond by editing these guidelines to keep the community safe from new threats. Fear not: you will be notified by an announcement from Bailey if the guidelines change.",

As a result, we've been lucky to attract one of the warmest, kindest, most courteous and supportive communities on the internet. There are many traits that make up Habiticans. Some of the most common and most notable are:",

-    "commGuideList01Cpart2": "Habiticans cheer for each other's victories, and comfort each other during hard times. We lend strength to each other and lean on each other and learn from each other. In parties, we do this with our spells; in chat rooms, we do this with kind and supportive words.",

-    "commGuideList02B": "Do not post images or text that are violent, threatening, or sexually explicit/suggestive, or that promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group.",
-    "commGuideList02Bpart2": "Not even as a joke. This includes slurs as well as statements. Not everyone has the same sense of humor, and so something that you consider a joke may be hurtful to another. Attack your Dailies, not each other.",

-    "commGuideList02D": "Avoid profanity.",
-    "commGuideList02Dpart2": "This includes milder, religious-based oaths that may be acceptable elsewhere-we have people from all religious and cultural backgrounds, and we want to make sure that all of them feel comfortable in public spaces. Additionally, slurs will be dealt with very severely, as they are also a violation of the Terms of Service.",
-    "commGuideList02E": "Avoid extended discussions of divisive topics outside of the Back Corner.",
-    "commGuideList02Epart2": "If you feel that someone has said something rude or hurtful, do not engage them. A single, polite comment, such as \"That joke makes me feel uncomfortable,\" is fine, but being harsh or unkind in response to harsh or unkind comments heightens tensions and makes HabitRPG a more negative space. Kindness and politeness helps others understand where you are coming from.",

-    "commGuideList02Gpart2": "if someone tells you that something you said or did made them uncomfortable. There is great strength in being able to sincerely apologize to someone. If you feel that the way they responded to you was inappropriate, contact a mod rather than calling them out on it publicly.",
-    "commGuideList02H": "Divisive/contentious conversations should be reported to mods.",
-    "commGuideList02Hpart2": "If you feel that a conversation is getting heated, overly emotional, or hurtful, cease to engage. Instead, email",

-    "commGuidePara021": "Furthermore, some public spaces in Habitica have additional guidelines.",
-    "commGuideHeadingTavern": "The Tavern",
-    "commGuidePara022": "The Tavern is the main spot for Habiticans to mingle. Daniel the Barkeep keeps the place spic-and-span, and Lemoness will happily conjure up some lemonade while you sit and chat. Just keep in mind...",
-    "commGuidePara023": "Conversation tends to revolve around casual chatting and productivity or life improvement tips.",
-    "commGuidePara024": "Because the Tavern chat can only hold 200 messages,",
-    "commGuidePara024part2": "it isn't a good place for prolonged conversations on topics, especially sensitive ones",
-    "commGuidePara024part3": "(ex. politics, religion, depression, whether or not goblin-hunting should be banned, etc.). These conversations should be taken to an applicable guild or the Back Corner (more information below).",
-    "commGuidePara027": "Don't discuss anything addictive in the Tavern.",
-    "commGuidePara027part2": "Many people use HabitRPG to try to quit their bad Habits. Hearing people talk about addictive/illegal substances may make this much harder for them! Respect your fellow Tavern-goers and take this into consideration. This includes, but is not exclusive to: smoking, alcohol, pornography, gambling, and drug use/abuse.",
-    "commGuideHeadingPublicGuilds": "Public Guilds",
-    "commGuidePara029": "Public guilds are much like the Tavern, except that instead of being centered around general conversation, they have a focused theme.",
-    "commGuidePara029part2": "Public guild chat should focus on this theme. For example, members of the Wordsmiths guild might be cross if they found the conversation suddenly focusing on gardening instead of writing, and a Dragon-Fanciers guild might not have any interest in deciphering ancient runes. Some guilds are more lax about this than others, but in general,",
-    "commGuidePara029part3": "try to stay on topic!",
-    "commGuidePara031": "Some public guilds will contain sensitive topics such as depression, religion, politics, etc.",
-    "commGuidePara031part2": "This is fine as long as the conversations therein do not violate any of the Terms and Conditions or Public Space Rules, and as long as they stay on topic.",
-    "commGuidePara033": "Public Guilds may NOT contain 18+ content. If they plan to regularly discuss sensitive content, they should say so in the Guild title.",
-    "commGuidePara033part2": "This is to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone. If the guild in question has different kinds of sensitive issues, it is respectful to your fellow Habiticans to place your comment behind a warning (ex. \"Warning: references self-harm\"). Additionally, the sensitive material should be topical -- bringing up self-harm in a guild focused on fighting depression may make sense, but may be less appropriate in a music guild. If you see someone who is repeatedly violating this guideline, even after several requests, please email",
-    "commGuidePara033part3": "with screenshots.",
-    "commGuidePara035": "No Guilds, Public or Private, should be created for the purpose of attacking any group or individual. Creating such a Guild is grounds for an instant ban.",
-    "commGuidePara035part2": "Fight bad habits, not your fellow adventurers!",
-    "commGuidePara037": "All Tavern Challenges and Public Guild Challenges must comply with these rules as well.",
-    "commGuideHeadingBackCorner": "The Back Corner",
-    "commGuidePara038": "Sometimes a conversation will get too long, off-topic, or sensitive to be continued in a Public Space without making users uncomfortable. In that case, the conversation will be directed to the Back Corner Guild. Note that being directed to the Back Corner is not at all a punishment!",
-    "commGuidePara038part2": "In fact, many Habiticans like to hang out there and discuss things at length.",
-    "commGuidePara039": "The Back Corner Guild is a free public space to discuss sensitive material or a single conversation for a long time, and it is carefully moderated.",
-    "commGuidePara039part2": "The Public Space Guidelines still apply, as do all of the Terms and Conditions.",
-    "commGuidePara039part3": "Just because we are wearing long cloaks and clustering in a corner doesn't mean that anything goes! Now pass me that smoldering candle, will you?",
-    "commGuideHeadingTrello": "Trello Boards",
-    "commGuidePara040": "Trello serves as an open forum for suggestions and discussion of site features.",
-    "commGuidePara040part2": "Habitica is ruled by the people in the form of valiant contributors-we all build the site together. Trello is the system that lends method to our madness. Out of consideration for this,",
-    "commGuidePara040part3": "try your best to contain all your thoughts into one comment, instead of commenting many times in a row on the same card. If you think of something new, feel free to edit your original comments.",
-    "commGuidePara040part4": "Please, take pity on those of us who receive a notification for every new comment. Our inboxes can only withstand so much.",
-    "commGuidePara041": "HabitRPG uses five different Trello boards:",
-    "commGuideList03A": "Main Board",

-    "commGuidePara042": "All have their own guidelines outlined, and the Public Spaces rules apply.",
-    "commGuidePara042part2": "Users should avoid going off-topic in any of the boards or cards. Trust us, the boards get crowded enough as it is! Prolonged conversations should be moved to the Back Corner Guild.",

+    "commGuideHeadingWelcome": "Bienvenue en Habitica !",
+    "commGuidePara001": "Salutations, brave ! Bienvenue en Habitica, le pays de la productivité, de la vie saine et des griffons ravageurs occasionnels. Nous sommes une joyeuse communauté faite de personnes serviables qui se soutiennent les unes les autres sur la voie de l’amélioration de soi.",

Nous les avons minutieusement forgées afin de les rendre aussi agréables et faciles à lire que possible. Nous vous enjoignons à prendre le temps de les lire.",
+    "commGuidePara003": "Ces règles s’appliquent à tous les espaces sociaux que nous utilisons, comprenant (mais pas forcément limités à) Trello, GitHub, Transifex et Wikia (c’est-à-dire le wiki). Parfois, des situations imprévues surgiront, comme une nouvelle source de conflit ou un nécromancien perfide. Si cela arrive, les modérateurs et modératrices (Mods) pourront y faire face en éditant ces règles de conduite afin de protéger la communauté de nouvelles menaces. Soyez sans crainte : vous serez prévenu·es par une annonce de Bailey si cela devait être le cas.",

Certains des plus courants et des plus marquants sont :",

Nous échangeons nos forces et comptons sur les autres et apprenons les un·e·s des autres.

Souvenez-vous : les Habiticien·ne·s viennent de tous horizons et ont eu des expériences drastiquement différentes. C’est ce qui rend HabitRPG si génial !

Cela inclut les injures aussi bien que les déclarations. Tout le monde n’a pas le même sens de l’humour, et ce que vous considérez comme une plaisanterie peut être blessant pour une autre personne. Attaquez vos Quotidiennes, pas vos semblables.",
+    "commGuideList02C": "<strong>Gardez les discussions à un niveau correct.</strong> Il y a de nombreux jeunes Habitien-ne-s sur le site. Ne souillons pas d'innocents esprits et ne détournons pas les autres Habiticien-ne-s de leurs objectifs.",
+    "commGuideList02D": "<strong>Évitez les grossièretés.</strong> Cela comprend les jurons plus ou moins gros, les grossièretés religieuses qui pourraient être acceptées ailleurs - nous accueillons des personnes de toutes religions et cultures et voulons nous assurer que toutes se sentent à l’aise dans les espaces publics. De plus, les injures seront traitées très sévèrement car elles contreviennent aux Conditions d’utilisation.",
+    "commGuideList02E": "<strong>Évitez les discussions longues ou polémiques en dehors de l'Arrière-Boutique.</strong> Si vous pensez que quelqu’un vous a parlé de façon injurieuse ou inconvenante, ne renchérissez pas. Un commentaire simple, poli tel que \"Cette plaisanterie me met mal à l’aise\" est acceptable, mais une réponse sèche ou méchante à un commentaire sec ou méchant ne fait qu’accentuer la tension et fait de HabitRPG un espace négatif. L’amabilité et la politesse aident les autres à mieux vous comprendre.",
+    "commGuideList02F": "<strong>Obtempérez immédiatement si un Modérateur vous demande</strong> de cesser une conversation ou de la déplacer au Back Corner. Les derniers mots et tirades finales devraient être lancés (courtoisement) à votre \"table\" dans le Back Corner, si vous en avez la permission.",

Ces conversations devraient être tenues dans une guilde appropriée ou dans l'Arrière-Boutique (plus d’informations ci-dessous).",

+    "commGuidePara029": "<strong>Les Guildes Publiques ressemblent à la Taverne, mais elles sont centrées autour d’un thème particulier et pas sur une conversation générale.</strong> La messagerie d’une guilde publique devrait se concentrer sur ce thème. Par exemple, les membres de la Guilde des Scribes pourraient être froissés si l’on découvrait une conversation sur le jardinage plutôt que sur l’écriture, et une guilde de Fans de Dragons ne trouverait que peu d’intérêt dans l’étude des runes anciennes. Certaines guildes sont plus coulantes que d’autres mais de façon générale <strong> essayez de ne pas vous éloigner du sujet !</strong>",
+    "commGuidePara031": "<strong>Certaines Guildes Publiques peuvent contenir des contenus sensibles comme la dépression, la religion, la politique, etc.</strong> Ceci est permis tant que les conversations ne violent ni les Termes et Conditions ni les Règles d’Espaces Publics et qu’elles ne dérivent pas du sujet.",
+    "commGuidePara033": "<strong>Les Guildes Publiques ne doivent PAS contenir de contenu adulte. S’il est prévu que des sujets sensibles soient discutés souvent, cela devrait être mentionné dans le nom de la Guilde.</strong> Cela permet de garder Habitica agréable et confortable pour tout le monde. Si une guilde discute de divers sujets sensibles, il est plus respectueux envers vos camarades de placer un avertissement avant votre commentaire (par exemple : Attention, mentions d’automutilation). De plus, tout contenu sensible doit rester cohérent avec les sujets discutés – parler d’automutilation dans une guilde échangeant sur la dépression est logique, mais pas approprié dans une guilde musicale. Si vous voyez quelqu’un enfreindre cette règle de façon répétée, même après plusieurs requêtes, envoyez un courriel à <a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitrpg.com\">leslie@habitrpg.com</a> avec des captures d'écran.",

Dans ce cas, la conversation sera redirigée vers \"l'Arrière-Boutique\", la Back Corner Guild.
