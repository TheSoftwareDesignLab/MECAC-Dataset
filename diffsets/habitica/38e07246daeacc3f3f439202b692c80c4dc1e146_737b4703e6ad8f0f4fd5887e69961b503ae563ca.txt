More Quest-lines unlock at levels 30, 40, and 60 respectively. \n\n - When you invite people to your Party on the [website](https://habitica.com/#/options/groups/party), you'll be rewarded with the Basi-List Scroll!

(We will add this feature to the app in a future update.)\n\n To battle the Boss or collect items for a Collection Quest, simply complete your tasks normally, and they will be tallied into damage overnight. (Reloading by pulling down on the screen may be required to see the Boss's health bar go down.) If you are fighting a Boss and you missed any Dailies, the Boss will damage your Party at the same time that you damage the Boss. \n\n After level 11 Mages and Warriors will gain Skills that allow them to deal additional damage to the Boss, so these are excellent classes to choose at level 10 if you want to be a heavy hitter.",
