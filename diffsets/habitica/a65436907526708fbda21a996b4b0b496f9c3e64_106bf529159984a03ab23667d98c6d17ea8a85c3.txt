   "faqQuestion6": "How do I get a Pet or Mount?",
   "iosFaqAnswer6": "At level 3, you will unlock the Drop System. Every time you complete a task, you'll have a random chance at receiving an egg, a hatching potion, or a piece of food. They will be stored in Menu > Items.\n\n To hatch a Pet, you'll need an egg and a hatching potion. Tap on the egg to determine the species you want to hatch, and select \"Hatch Egg.\" Then choose a hatching potion to determine its color! Go to Menu > Pets to equip your new Pet to your avatar by clicking on it. \n\n You can also grow your Pets into Mounts by feeding them under Menu > Pets. Tap on a Pet, and then select \"Feed Pet\"! You'll have to feed a pet many times before it becomes a Mount, but if you can figure out its favorite food, it will grow more quickly. Use trial and error, or [see the spoilers here](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Food#Food_Preferences).

   "faqQuestion7": "How do I become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer?",
   "iosFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their Party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their Party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their Party members.\n\n If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click “Decide Later” and choose later under Menu > Choose Class.",
