   "questRatNotes": "Garbage! Massive piles of unchecked dailies are lying all across Habitica. The problem has become so serious that hordes of rats are now seen everywhere. You notice @Pandah petting one of the beasts lovingly. She explains that rats are gentle creatures that feed on unchecked dailies. The real problem is that the dailies have fallen into the sewer, creating a dangerous pit that must be cleared. As you descend into the sewers, a massive rat, with blood red eyes and mangled yellow teeth, attacks you, defending its horde. Will you cower in fear or face the fabled Rat King?",

You notice @Pandah standing behind you, looking at the once mighty creature. She explains that the citizens of Habitica have been inspiried by your courage and are quickly completing all their unchecked dailies. She warns you that we must be vigilant, for should we let out down our guard, the Rat King will return. As payment, @Pandah offers you several rat eggs. Noticing your uneasy expression, she smiles, \"They make wonderful pets.\"",

Confident in yourselves and your ability to withstand the wyrm's influence, your party makes it's way to Mt. Habitica. You approach the entrance to the mountain's caverns and pause. Swells of shadows, almost like fog, wisp out from the opening. It is near impossible to see anything in front of you. The light from your lanterns seem to end abruptly where the shadows begin. It is said that only magical light can pierce the dragon's infernal haze. If you can find enough light crystals, you could make your way to the dragon.",
