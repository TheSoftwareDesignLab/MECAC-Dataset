If you want to be certain that your change has been saved, reload the page and check that the new value is being displayed.<br><br>Some people have trouble with Custom Day Start on the first day that they change it because changing it can cause Cron to run immediately, but after the first day it works well. To minimize problems on the first day, <strong>complete all your Dailies before changing the Custom Day Start</strong> or Rest in the Inn that day.<br><br>If you change the Custom Day Start from or to a time that is too close to the current time, then the new setting will not be used until the next day. It is best to allow a window of two hours for the change to take effect. For example, if it is currently set to 0 (midnight), change it before 10pm; if you want to set it to 9pm, change it before 7pm.",
