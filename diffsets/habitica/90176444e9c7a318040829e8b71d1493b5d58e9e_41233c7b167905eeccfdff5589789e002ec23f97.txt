-                    p Happy winter! Instead of a boring pair of earmuffs, why not use the gold that you earned with all your hard work to buy a Limited Edition class outfit?
-                    p From now until January 31st, you will be able to use your gold to buy your current class' armor set from the Rewards store! You can be a Yeti Tamer, a Ski-Sassin, a Candy Cane Mage, or a Snowflake Healer. If you switch classes (system unlocked at level 10), you will gain access to your new classes' armor set. Make sure to collect yours first, though!
-                    p What are you waiting for? Go be productive and earn some gold!

+                    p To clear some confusion, you have until Jan 31, 2014 to <strong>purchase</strong> your quest scrolls, after 1/31 Alexander no longer sells them. You can still begin / finish your quests any time after. Thanks to @Cole, you're now allowed to purchase the Cub quest even if you haven't finished Trapper. Stock up!
