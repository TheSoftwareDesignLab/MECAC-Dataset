Ye will nah loot any damage or 'ave yer account harmed durin' that weekend, even if ye can't log in t' check off yer Dailies in time! We shall be workin' mighty hard t' make th' downtime as short as possible, 'n will be postin' regular updates on <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>our Twitter account</a>. At th' end o' th' downtime, t' thank everyone fer thar patience, ye will all receive a rare pet!",

-    "maintenanceInfoWhyText": "For the past several months, we have been thoroughly revamping Habitica behind-the-scenes. Specifically, we have rewritten the API. While it may not look much different on the surface, it’s a whole new world underneath. This will allow us WAY more flexibility when we want to build features in the future, and lead to improved performance!",
