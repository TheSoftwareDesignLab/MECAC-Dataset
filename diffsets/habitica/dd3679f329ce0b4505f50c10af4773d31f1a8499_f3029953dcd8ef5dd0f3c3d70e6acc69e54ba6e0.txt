Pozytywne nawyki mogą zapewnić ci nagrody, jak Złoto czy Doświadczenie (Exp), podczas gdy Negatywne spowodują utratę Punktów zdrowia (PZ).\n\nCodzienne są powtarzalnymi zadaniami, które chcesz wykonywać w zorganizowanym schemacie. Na przykład, raz na dzień, trzy razy w tygodniu albo cztery razy w miesiącu. Pominięcie Codziennych powoduje utratę PZ, ale im trudniejsze są, tym lepsze nagrody!\n\nDo Zrobienia to jednorazowe zadania, które zapewniają nagrodę gdy tylko je wykonasz. Do Zrobienia mogą mieć wskazaną datę wykonania, ale nie stracisz PZ jeśli jej nie dotrzymasz.\n\nWybierz typ zadań, który najlepiej odpowiada temu, co próbujesz osiągnąć!",
