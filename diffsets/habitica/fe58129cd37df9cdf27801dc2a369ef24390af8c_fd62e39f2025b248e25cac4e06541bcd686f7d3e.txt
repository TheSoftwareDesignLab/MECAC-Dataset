   "questOctopusNotes": "@Urse, a wild-eyed young scribe, has asked for your help exploring a mysterious cave by the sea shore. Among the twilight tidepools stands a massive gate of stalactites and stalagmites. As you near the gate, a dark whirlpool begins to spin at its base. You stare in awe as a squid-like dragon rises through the maw. \"The sticky spawn of the stars has awakened,\" roars @Urse madly. \"After vigintillions of years, the great Octothulu is loose again, and ravening for delight!\"",
-  "questOctopusCompletion": "Completion: With a final blow, the creature slips away into the whirlpool from which it came. You cannot tell if @Urse is happy with your victory or saddened to see the beast go. Wordlessly, your companion points to three slimy, gargantuan eggs in a nearby tidepool, set in a nest of gold coins. \"Probably just octopus eggs,\" you say nervously. As you return home, @Urse frantically scribbles in a journal and you suspect this is not the last time you will hear of the great Octothulu.",
