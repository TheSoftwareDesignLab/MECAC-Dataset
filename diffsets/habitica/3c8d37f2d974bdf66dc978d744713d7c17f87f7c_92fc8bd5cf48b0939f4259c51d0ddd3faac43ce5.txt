+Suggestion:
+
+Do NOT copy this file to the other language folders because it
+contains nothing but people's names and hence won't need to be
+translated. The names are likely to change every so often, so
+unnecessary copies are good to avoid.
+
+An exception would be for languages (if any) where commas are not used
+to separate words in a list.
