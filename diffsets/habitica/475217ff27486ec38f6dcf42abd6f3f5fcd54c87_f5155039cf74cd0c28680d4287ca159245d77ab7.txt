Something… alive.” He swims up from the table. “The Joyful Reaper needs to hear about this. Let’s pack a meal for the road.”",

     "questLostMasterclasser2Notes": "The Joyful Reaper drums her bony fingers on some of the books that you brought. “Oh, dear,” the Master of Healers says. “There is a malevolent life essence at work. I might have guessed, considering the attacks by reanimated skulls during each incident.” Her assistant @tricksy.fox brings in a chest, and you are startled to see the contents that @beffymaroo unloads: the very same objects once used by this mysterious Tzina to possess people.<br><br>“I’m going to use resonant healing magic to try to make this creature manifest,” the Joyful Reaper says, reminding you that the skeleton is a somewhat unconventional Healer. “You’ll need to read the revealed information quickly, in case it breaks loose.”<br><br>As she concentrates, a twisting mist begins to siphon from the books and twine around the objects. Quickly, you flip through the pages, trying to read the new lines of text that are writhing into view. You catch only a few snippets: “Sands of the Timewastes” — “the Great Disaster” —“split into four”— “permanently corrupted”— before a single name catches your eye: Zinnya.<br><br>Abruptly, the pages wrench free from your fingers and shred themselves as a howling creature explodes into being, coalescing around the possessed objects.<br><br>“It’s an a’Voidant!” the Joyful Reaper shouts, throwing up a protection spell. “They’re ancient creatures of confusion and obscurity. If this Tzina can control one, she must have a frightening command over life magic. Quickly, attack it before it escapes back into the books!”<br><br>",
     "questLostMasterclasser2Completion": "The a’Voidant succumbs at last, and you share the snippets that you read.<br><br>“None of those references sound familiar, even for someone as old as I,” the Joyful Reaper says. “Except… the Timewastes are a distant desert at the most hostile edge of Habitica. Portals often fail nearby, but swift mounts could get you there in no time. Lady Glaciate will be glad to assist.” Her voice grows amused. “Which means that the enamored Master of Rogues will undoubtedly tag along.” She hands you the glimmering mask. “Perhaps you should try to track the lingering magic in these items to its source. I’ll go harvest some sustenance for your journey.”",
