   "questGoldenknight1Notes": "<p>The Golden Knight has been getting on poor Habiticans' cases. Didn't do all of your Dailies? Checked off a negative Habit? She will use this as a reason to harass you about how you should follow her example. She is the shining example of a perfect Habitican, and you are naught but a failure. Well, that is not nice at all! Everyone makes mistakes. They should not have to be met with such negativity for it. Perhaps it is time you gather some testimonies from hurt Habiticans and give the Golden Knight a stern talking-to!</p>",

You begin to recite the Habitcan's complaints to her, one by one. \"And @Pfeffernusse says that your constant bragging-\" The knight raises her hand to silence you and scoffs, \"Please, these people are merely jealous of my success. Instead of complaining, they should simply work as hard as I! Perhaps I shall show you the power you can attain through diligence such as mine!\" She raises her morningstar and prepares to attack you!</p>",
