-## How to add a new language
-- All the old files in `/locales` has been moved to `/locales_old`. 
-- New files must have a `languageName` property (translated or not in english? Italian or Italiano?) and might have a `stringNotFound` property.
-- The language folder under `/locales` must be named with a two letters code (en, es... not en_US or similar) and the code must match the one passed by the browser (we should find a table for that...)

-## How to translate a string
-
-- If the string is in a `.jade` file it can be accessed with `env.t('string name here')`
-- If the string is in a `.js` file it can be accessed with `window.env.t('string name here')`
