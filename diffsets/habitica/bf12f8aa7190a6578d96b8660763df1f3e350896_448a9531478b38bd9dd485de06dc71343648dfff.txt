-For each element there's a .variables file that contains variables that are different for our theme and a .overrides file that contains custom CSS properties.
-
-More info on theming can be found at http://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html.

You can add more later as you think of them!<br><br>\n * **Set up [To-Dos](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/To-Dos):**\n\n  Enter tasks you do once or rarely in the To-Dos column, one at a time. You can click the pencil to edit them and add checklists, due dates, and more!<br><br>\n * **Set up [Dailies](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Dailies):**\n\n Enter activities you need to do daily or on a particular day of the week in the Dailies column. Click the item's pencil icon to 'edit' the day(s) of the week it will be due. You can also make it due on a repeating basis, for example, every 3 days.<br><br>\n * **Set up [Habits](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habits):**\n\n Enter habits you want to establish in the Habits column. You can edit the Habit to change it to just a good habit <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-plus'></span> or a bad habit <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-minus'></span>.<br><br>\n * **Set up [Rewards](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Rewards):**\n\n In addition to the in-game Rewards offered, add activities or treats which you want to use as a motivation to the Rewards column. It's important to give yourself a break or allow some indulgence in moderation!<br><br> If you need inspiration for which tasks to add, you can look at the wiki's pages on [Sample Habits](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Habits), [Sample Dailies](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Dailies), [Sample To-Dos](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_To-Dos), and [Sample Rewards](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Sample_Custom_Rewards).",

As you complete tasks and check them off in Habitica, you will gain [Experience](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Experience_Points), which helps you level up, and [Gold](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_Points), which allows you to purchase Rewards. If you fall into bad habits or miss your Dailies, you will lose [Health](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Health_Points). In that way, the Habitica Experience and Health bars serve as a fun indicator of your progress toward your goals.
