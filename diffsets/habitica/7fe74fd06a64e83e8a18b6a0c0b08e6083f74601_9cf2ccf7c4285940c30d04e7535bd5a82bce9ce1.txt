-      p Welcome to the new Habitica! We're so excited to share it with you at last. This project, which has been a labor of love since last December, is the single biggest update that Habitica has ever released (with over 150 pages of designs, an entire rewrite of all of our front-end code, countless rounds of testing and iteration, and many, many meetings). Just refresh your page to load the new website!

-        li Click directly on your tasks to bring up the edit modal!
-        li The navigation bar contains several changes to be more intuitive for new users, so we recommend taking some time to open the drop-down menus and familiarize yourself with the new locations. Notably, the User menu has moved to an icon in the upper-right corner.
-        li You can now pin any purchasable item in the game to your Rewards. You can pin Backgrounds, too! Just hover over the shop icon and click the pin. When you head back to the tasks page, you'll see it in your Rewards column!
-        li There are lots of new filtering options, especially for Guilds and Challenges!
-        li There are visual upgrades for every aspect of the site, from the front page to the Seasonal Shop. We hope that you like them!

-      p If you have thoughts about the new design, we look forward to hearing them. On <strong>October 12th</strong> we will be opening a Trello card for public comments on the redesign. This delay will give us time to focus our attention on answering general questions and fixing any bugs that might arise. For this reason, we ask that you hold back on sharing your feedback about the new designs until that Trello card is live and linked in a Bailey announcement. Thanks for understanding!
