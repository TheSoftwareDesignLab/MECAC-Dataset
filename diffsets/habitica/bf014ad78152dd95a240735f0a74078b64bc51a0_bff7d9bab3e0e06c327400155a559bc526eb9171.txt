Non subirai alcun danno e il tuo account non subirà alcun cambiamento durante il weekend, anche se non potrai accedere e spuntare le tue Attività Giornaliere in tempo!

Queste sono tutte funzioni interconnesse, quindi ci vorrà tempo per costruirle, ma finché non abbiamo finito con questa riscrittura non possiamo cominciare a lavorarci.",

Le Attività Giornaliere che avete spuntato verranno ripristinate, i bonus saranno resettati, e così via. Se state partecipando ad una Sfida di raccolta oggetti, continuerete a trovare oggetti. Se vi trovate in una battaglia contro un Boss, si potranno ancora causare danni al Boss, ma quest'ultimo non infliggerà danni a voi. (Anche i mostri hanno bisogno di una pausa!)",

We zullen zo hard mogelijk werken om zo snel mogelijk weer in de lucht te zijn en plaatsen updates op <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'> onze Twitter-account</a>. Aan het einde van het onderhoud ontvangt iedereen als bedankje voor het geduld een zeldzaam dier!",
-    "maintenanceInfoWhy": "Waarom gebeurt dit?",
-    "maintenanceInfoWhyText": "De afgelopen maanden hebben wij achter de schermen hard nagedacht over een make-over voor Habitica. We hebben vooral de API herschreven. Hoewel dit op het eerste gezicht niet heel anders lijkt te zijn, is er in werkelijkheid heel wat vernieuwd. Dit geeft ons veel meer flexibiliteit wanneer we in de toekomst andere functies willen toevoegen, en het leidt tot verbeterde prestaties!",

Als je veranderingen opmerkt die er niet zouden moeten zijn, stuur dan een e-mail naar <%= hrefTechAssistanceEmail %> en we zullen het voor je uitzoeken!",
-    "maintenanceInfoAddFeatures": "Wat voor functies zal dit Habitica in staat stellen toe te voegen?",
-    "maintenanceInfoAddFeaturesText": "Alles herschrijven zal ons in staat stellen om een verbeterde chat in de gilden te plaatsen, plannen op te stellen voor organisaties en families, additionele productiviteitsfuncties zoals maandelijkse taken en de mogelijkheid om taken van gisteren af te vinken. Dit zijn allemaal op zichzelf staande functies, dus het kost tijd om ze te bouwen, maar het was onmogelijk om eraan te beginnen voordat alles herschreven is.",
-    "maintenanceInfoHowLong": "Hoe lang zal dit onderhoud duren?",
-    "maintenanceInfoHowLongText": "We moeten taken en data verhuizen voor alle 1,3 miljoen Habitica gebruikers -- geen makkelijke taak! We verwachten dat dit plaats zal vinden tussen 13:00 uur Pacifische tijd (20:00 uur UTC) en 22:00 uur Pacifische tijd (5:00 uur UTC). Wees gerust, we doen er alles aan om het zo snel mogelijk te volbrengen. Je kunt updates volgen <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>op onze Twitter</a>.",
-    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffected": "Wat voor effect heeft dit op mijn Dagtaken, Series, Versterkingen en Queesten?",
-    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText1": "Je zult GEEN enkele schade of verlies van streak krijgen dit weekend, je dag zal normaal resetten. Dagelijkse taken die je afgevinkt had zullen weer onafgevinkt staan, buffs gereset etc. Als je in een verzamelqueeste zit, zul je nog steeds voorwerpen vinden. Als je in een eindbazengevecht zit, zul jij nog steeds schade toebrengen aan de baas maar de baas niet aan jou. (Ook monsters hebben immers een pauze nodig!)",
-    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText2": "Na lang nagedacht te hebben, kwam ons team tot de conclusie dat dit de eerlijkste manier was om goed te maken voor het feit dat veel gebruikers niet in staat waren om hun Dagelijkse Taken af te vinken tijdens het onderhoud. Onze excuses voor het ongemak dat hierdoor werd veroorzaakt!",
-    "maintenanceInfoSeeTasks": "Wat als ik mijn takenlijst moet zien?",
-    "maintenanceInfoSeeTasksText": "Als je al weet dat je zaterdag je takenlijst moet bekijken, dan raden wij je aan om een screenshot te nemen van je takenlijst vóór het onderhoud, zodat je daarop je daginvulling zal kunnen volgen tijdens het siteonderhoud.",
-    "maintenanceInfoRarePet": "Wat voor zeldzaam dier zal ik ontvangen?",
-    "maintenanceInfoRarePetText": "Aan het einde van het onderhoud, ontvangt iedereen als bedankje voor het geduld een Veteraandier! Als je nooit een Veteraandier hebt ontvangen zul je nu een Veteraanwolf krijgen. Als je al een Veteraanwolf hebt zul je een Veteraantijger krijgen. En als al je beide hebt, dan zul je een nooit eerder gezien Veteraandier ontvangen! Na het technisch onderhoud kan het enkele uren duren voordat je het Veteraandier zal zien, maar wees niet ongerust: iedereen krijgt er een.",
-    "maintenanceInfoWho": "Wie heeft er gewerkt aan dit enorme project?",
-    "maintenanceInfoWhoText": "We zijn blij dat je het vraagt! Het is gelukt door onze fantastische bijdrager Paglias, en met veel hulp van Blade, TheHollidayInn, SabreCat, Victor Pudeyev, TheUnknown en Alys.",
-    "maintenanceInfoTesting": "De nieuwe versie is ontelbare keren getest door een stel geweldige open-source vrijwilligers. Bedankt, we zouden hier zonder jullie nooit in geslaagd zijn."

-  "maintenanceInfoWhat": "What is happening?",
-  "maintenanceInfoWhatText": "On May 21, Habitica will be down for maintenance for most of the day. You will not take any damage or have your account harmed during that weekend, even if you can’t log in to check off your Dailies in time! We will be working very hard to make the downtime as short as possible, and will be posting regular updates on <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>our Twitter account</a>. At the end of the downtime, to thank everyone for their patience, you will all receive a rare pet!",
-  "maintenanceInfoWhy": "Why is this happening?",
-  "maintenanceInfoWhyText": "For the past several months, we have been thoroughly revamping Habitica behind-the-scenes. Specifically, we have rewritten the API. While it may not look much different on the surface, it’s a whole new world underneath. This will allow us WAY more flexibility when we want to build features in the future, and lead to improved performance!",

-  "maintenanceInfoMore": "More Information",
-  "maintenanceInfoAccountChanges": "What changes will I see to my account after the rewrite is complete?",
-  "maintenanceInfoAccountChangesText": "At first, there won’t be any notable changes aside from performance improvements for features such as Challenges. If you notice any changes that shouldn’t be there, email us at <%= hrefTechAssistanceEmail %> and we will investigate them for you!",
-  "maintenanceInfoAddFeatures": "What kind of features will this allow Habitica to add?",
-  "maintenanceInfoAddFeaturesText": "Completing this rewrite will allow us to start building out improved chat and Guilds, plans for organizations and families, and additional productivity features like Monthlies and the ability to record yesterday’s activity! Those are all involved features on their own, so it will take time to build them, but until we were finished with this rewrite, there was no way we could start them.",
-  "maintenanceInfoHowLong": "How long will the maintenance take?",
-  "maintenanceInfoHowLongText": "We have to migrate tasks and data for all 1.3 million Habitica users -- not an easy task! We anticipate that it will take place between approximately 1pm Pacific Time (8pm UTC) and 10pm Pacific Time (5am UTC). Rest assured that we’re doing everything we can to make it go as quickly as possible! You can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/habitica' target='_blank'>updates on our Twitter</a>.",
-  "maintenanceInfoStatsAffected": "How will my Dailies, Streaks, Buffs, and Quests be affected?",
-  "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText1": "You will NOT take any damage or lose any streaks that weekend, but otherwise, your day will reset normally! Dailies that you checked will become unchecked, buffs will reset, etc. If you are in a Collection Quest, you will still find items. If you are in a Boss Battle, you will still deal damage to the Boss, but the Boss will not deal damage to you. (Even monsters need a break!)",
-  "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText2": "After a lot of thought, our team concluded that this was the most fair way to handle the fact that many users will not be able to check off their Dailies normally during the maintenance. We’re sorry for any inconvenience this causes!",
-  "maintenanceInfoSeeTasks": "What if I need to see my task list?",
-  "maintenanceInfoSeeTasksText": "If you know that you will need to see your task list on Saturday to remind yourself what you have to do, we recommend that before the maintenance begins, you take a screenshot of your tasks so that you can use it as a reference.",
-  "maintenanceInfoRarePet": "What kind of rare pet will I receive?",
-  "maintenanceInfoRarePetText": "To thank you for your patience during the downtime, everyone will get a rare Veteran Pet. If you’ve never received a Veteran Pet before, you will receive a Veteran Wolf. If you already have a Veteran Wolf, you will receive a Veteran Tiger. And if you already have a Veteran Wolf and a Veteran Tiger, you will receive a never-before-seen Veteran pet! After the migration is completed, it may take several hours for your pet to show up, but never fear, everyone will get one.",
-  "maintenanceInfoWho": "Who worked on this massive project?",
-  "maintenanceInfoWhoText": "We’re glad you asked! It was spearheaded by our amazing contributor paglias, with lots of help from Blade, TheHollidayInn, SabreCat, Victor Pudeyev, TheUnknown, and Alys.",
-  "maintenanceInfoTesting": "The new version was also tirelessly tested by a bunch of our amazing open-source volunteers. Thank you -- we couldn't have done this without you."

-    "maintenanceInfoWhyText": "在過去的幾個月裡，我們在後台徹底改進了Habitica。特別的是我們重新寫了API。雖然在前台可能看起來沒有什麼改變，在後台它已經是一個全新的世界。這將使我們在未來想要寫一個新功能的時候，有更大的彈性，並且帶來更好的表現！",

-    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText2": "我們的團隊在思索已久後，結論出這是最為公平的處置—考慮到多數用戶無法在維護期間正常地勾選他們的每日任務。我們對此帶來的不便感到抱歉！",
