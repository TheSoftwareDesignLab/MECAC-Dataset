-        <h3>New Chat Performance Improvements</h3>
-        <p>We've deployed some behind-the-scenes improvements to the Tavern chat, which should cause the messages and avatars to load more quickly. Additionally, each chat message that you post in the Tavern and in Guilds will now remember the outfit your avatar was wearing when you post it, even on a refresh! We hope that these changes will make chatting even more enjoyable.</p>

+        <p>The sun is rising on Valentine's Day when a shocking crash splinters the air. A blaze of sickly pink light lances through all the buildings, and bricks crumble as a deep crack rips through Habit City's main street. An unearthly shrieking rises through the air, shattering windows as a hulking form slithers forth from the oozing earth.</p>
+        <p>Mandibles snap and a carapace glitters; legs upon legs unfurl in the air. The crowd begins to scream as the insectoid creature rears up, revealing itself to be none other than that cruelest of creatures: the fearsome Dysheartener itself. It howls in anticipation and lunges forward, hungering to gnaw on the hopes of hard-working Habiticans. With each rasping scrape of its spiny forelegs, you feel a vise of despair tightening in your chest.</p>
+        <p>"Take heart, everyone!" Lemoness shouts. "It probably thinks that we're easy targets because so many of us have daunting New Year's Resolutions, but it's about to discover that Habiticans know how to stick to their goals!"</p>
+        <p>AnnDeLune raises her staff. "Let's tackle our tasks and take this monster down!"</p>
+        <p class="text-center">~*~</p>
+        <p>Complete Habits, Dailies and To-Dos to damage the World Boss! Incomplete Dailies fill the Rage Strike Bar. When the Rage Strike bar is full, the World Boss will attack one of Habitica's shopkeepers. A World Boss will never damage individual players or accounts in any way. Only active accounts who are not resting in the Inn will have their incomplete Dailies tallied.</p>
