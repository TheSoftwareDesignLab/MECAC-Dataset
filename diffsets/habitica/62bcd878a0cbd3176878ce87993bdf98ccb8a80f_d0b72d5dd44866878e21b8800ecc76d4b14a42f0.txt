-        <p>Hello Habiticans! We're excited to announce the launch of our unique username system! We've made this change so it’s easier to find and invite your friends to Parties, Guilds, and Challenges, mention people in chat, and more. In the future we hope to use this functionality to introduce even more useful features, such as the option to receive notifications if you are mentioned in chat.</p>
-        <p>You can check and change your current Username in <a href='/user/settings/site' target='_blank'>Settings</a>. If you've just confirmed, check your Stable to find the Veteran Pet you've been given as a reward!</p>
-        <p>If you’d like to learn more about this change, this <a href='https://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Player_Names' target='_blank'>Wiki page</a> has more detailed information.</p>
-        <p>Thank you for being patient as we make these changes to improve Habitica!</p>

First, there's a <a href='https://habitica.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/taking-a-break-guild-spotlight/' target='_blank'>Guild Spotlight</a> that highlights the Guilds that can help you as you explore ways to use Habitica to help with sleep hygiene and taking breaks. We've also posted a <a href='https://habitica.wordpress.com/2018/11/15/use-case-spotlight-sleep-and-rest/' target='_blank'>Use Case Spotlight</a> featuring a number of great suggestions for using Habitica's task system to manage this as well! These suggestions were submitted by Habiticans in the <a href='/groups/guild/1d3a10bf-60aa-4806-a38b-82d1084a59e6' target='_blank'>Use Case Spotlights Guild</a>.</p>
+        <p>Plus, we're collecting user submissions for the next Use Case Spotlight! How do you use Habitica for professionalization and "adulting" skills? We’ll be featuring player-submitted examples in Use Case Spotlights on the Habitica Blog next month, so post your suggestions in the Use Case Spotlight Guild now. We look forward to learning more about how you use Habitica to improve your life and get things done!</p>
