-Suggestion:
-
-Do NOT copy this file to the other language folders because it
-contains nothing but people's names and hence won't need to be
-translated. The names are likely to change every so often, so
-unnecessary copies are good to avoid.
-
-An exception would be for languages (if any) where commas are not used
-to separate words in a list.
