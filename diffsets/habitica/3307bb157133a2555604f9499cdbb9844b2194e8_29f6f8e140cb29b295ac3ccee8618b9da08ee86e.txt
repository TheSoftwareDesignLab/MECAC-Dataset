A monster whose presence twists the wills of the strong heroes of the land, turning them towards bad habits and laziness! The beast is a grand dragon of immense power and comprised of the shadows themselves. Vice, the treacherous Shadow Wyrm. Brave Habiteers, stand up and defeat this foul beast once and for all, but only if you believe you can stand against its immense power. </p><h3>Vice Part 1: </h3><p>How can you expect to the fight the beast if it already has control over you? Don't fall victim to laziness and vice! Work hard to fight against the dragon's dark influence and dispel his hold on you! </p>"

Enjoy your victory, brave Habiteers, but take the lessons you've learned from battling Vice and move forward. There are still habits to be done and potentially worse evils to conquer!"
