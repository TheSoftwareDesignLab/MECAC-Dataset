-      p We've fixed a bug that was causing all participants in quest lines to receive the next scroll in a quest line, instead of just the person who originally started the quest. This caused duplication of quest scrolls. Now only the person who started the quest will receive the next quest scroll. All other rewards will still be given to all members of the party who participated in the quest.
