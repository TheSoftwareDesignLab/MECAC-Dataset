 	<string name="tip_navigation_t">To get directions to a place, either directly long-click on it on the map, (then tap its description marker and select \'Directions to\'), or select \'Directions\' after tapping any entry in a search results list or favorite list. 
 		\n\nThe destination is marked as an orange target flag marker on the map and OsmAnd displays the distance to it and the direction to it (orange triangle).
-		\n\nTo show a route to the destination from any point other than your current position, subsequently select it on the map and tap \'Directions from\'.
+		\n\nYou may chose to either \'Follow\' a route, which means that OsmAnd would live-guide you, give you voice instructions (if enabled), etc. Or you can select to \'Only show\' a route on the map, which would produce a static route without any live-guideance or adjustments as you move.
+		\n\nTo show a route to the selected destination from any point other than your current position, select the start point on the map and tap \'Directions from\'.
+		\n\nShould you select \'Directions from\' together with \'Follow\', OsmAnd will switch to your actual position as soon as it it found (so this can be used to jump-start routing before the position is found), while \'Directiosn from\' in combination with \'Only show\' just shows you the route from any arbitrary point you had selected without subsequent updates.
