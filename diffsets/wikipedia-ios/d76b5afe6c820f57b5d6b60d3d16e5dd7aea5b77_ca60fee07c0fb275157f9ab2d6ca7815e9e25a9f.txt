  *  RTL-compliant control which lays out a save button (bookmark icon) and text.
+ *
+ *  @warning
+ *  This class hard-codes images and text according to its @c selected state. Anything set in Interface Builder will
+ *  be overwritten.
+ *
+ *  @discussion
+ *  Also, AutoLayout constraints are used to ensure RTL compliance across iOS 8 & 9. Initial implementaion of a textual
+ *  save button used @c UIButton "out of the box" with @c titleEdgeInsets to space the icon & text.  The problems with
+ *  this approach were:
+ *
+ *    - iOS 8: Icon & text were still LTR when device was set to RTL language.<br/>
+ *    - iOS 9: Icon & text were overlapping each other since the inset wasn't also flipped.
+ *
+ *  The iOS 9 issue could've been worked around easily enough by flipping the inset (and setting the
+ *  @c contentHorizontalAlignment), but a custom control was needed for complete RTL compliance in iOS 8 & 9. See
+ *  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T121681 for more information, including screenshots.
