+# Translations
+
+The actual translations are handled by the crowdin platform at: <https://translate.authpass.app/authpass>. Do **not** modify any translated any
+app_XX.arb files manually.
+
+## New strings
+
+All new code should have translatable strings, even the code base still does not 100% use URL translations.
+
+* Add your string into `app_en.arb` - give a useful `description` (or `context`). (do NOT translate it in any other `app_XX.arb` file, as this is handled [through crowdin](https://translate.authpass.app/authpass)).
+* In the code typically use a variable in the `build` method: `final loc = AppLocalizations.of(context)` and access your string through `loc.xxxx`.
+* See the flutter [i18n/l10n documentation](https://flutter.dev/go/i18n-user-guide).

 as well as Flutter itself. You can checkout the Flutter website at https://flutter.dev/

 1. [Download Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and make sure `flutter doctor` shows no errors.
    * Latest Flutter stable or beta channel should typically work, check out
      [authpass/_tools/install_flutter.sh](authpass/_tools/install_flutter.sh) for what's being used in the CI.
