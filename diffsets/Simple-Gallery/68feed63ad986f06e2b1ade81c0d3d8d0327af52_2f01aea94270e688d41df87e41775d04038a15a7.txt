+    <string name="faq_5_title">What is the difference between hiding and excluding a folder\?</string>
     <string name="faq_5_text">Exclude prevents displaying the folder only in Simple Gallery, while Hide works system-wise and it hides the folder from other galleries too. It works by creating an empty \".nomedia\" file in the given folder, which you can then remove with any file manager too. Note that some devices do not allow hiding folders like Camera, Screenshots and Downloads.</string>

-    <string name="faq_8_title">What if I want just a few particular folders visible?</string>
-    <string name="faq_8_text">Adding a folder at the Included Folders doesn\'t automatically exclude anything. What you can do is go in Settings -> Manage Excluded Folders, exclude the root folder \"/\", then add the desired folders at Settings -> Manage Included Folders.
-        That will make only the selected folders visible, as both excluding and including are recursive and if a folder is both excluded and included, it will show up.</string>

     <string name="faq_13_text">The current solution for displaying images works fine in the vast majority of cases, but if you want even better image quality, you can enable the \"Show images in the highest possible quality\" at the app settings, in the \"Deep zoomable images\" section.</string>

+    <string name="faq_14_title">I have hidden a file/folder. How can I unhide it\?</string>
     <string name="faq_14_text">You can either press the \"Temporarily show hidden items\" menu item at the main screen, or toggle \"Show hidden items\" in the app settings to see the hidden item. If you want to unhide it, just long press it and select \"Unhide\". Folders are hidden by adding a hidden \".nomedia\" file into them, you can delete the file with any file manager too. Note that hiding works recursively though, so if you hide a folder, all subfolders will become hidden too. So for unhiding the subfolders you have to unhide the parent folder.</string>

+    <string name="faq_15_title">Why does the app take up so much space\?</string>
     <string name="faq_15_text">App cache can take up to 250MB, it ensures quicker image loading. If the app is taking up even more space, it is most likely caused by you having items in the Recycle Bin. Those files count to the app size. You can clear the Recycle bin by opening it and deleting all files, or from the app settings. Every file in the Bin is deleted automatically after 30 days.</string>

     <string name="faq_16_text">Starting with Android 11 you cannot hide or unhide files or folders anymore, you cannot see the hidden ones in gallery apps either. You will have to use some file manager for that.</string>

     <string name="faq_17_text">That stopped working due to the system changes that came with Android 11 too, the app cannot browse real folders anymore, it relies on the so called MediaStore at fetching data.</string>

     <string name="faq_18_text">Our apps have no ads whatsoever. If you see them during video playback, you must be using some other apps video player. Try finding your default video player in the device settings, then do a \"Clear defaults\" on it. The next time you invoke some video intent you will see an app picker prompt, where you can select what app you want to use.</string>
