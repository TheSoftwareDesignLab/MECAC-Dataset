If you want to unhide it, just long press it and select \"Unhide\". Folders are hidden by adding a hidden \".nomedia\" file into them, you can delete the file with any file manager too. Note that hiding works recursively though, so if you hide a folder, all subfolders will become hidden too. So for unhiding the subfolders you have to unhide the parent folder.</string>

If the app is taking up even more space, it is most likely caused by you having items in the Recycle Bin. Those files count to the app size. You can clear the Recycle bin by opening it and deleting all files, or from the app settings. Every file in the Bin is deleted automatically after 30 days.</string>
