 # Translations

 ## Current state
 
-Currently in place is integration with `flutter_localizations`
-package, allowing all flutter UI elements to be localized
+We have a framework set up that makes it possible for UI strings
+to be translated.  (This was issue #275.)  This means that when
+adding new strings to the UI, instead of using a constant string
+in English we'll add the string to that framework.
+For details, see below.
+
+At present not all of the codebase has been migrated to use the framework,
+so you'll see some existing code that uses constant strings.
+Fixing that is issue #277.
+
+At present we don't have the strings wired up to a platform for
+people to contribute translations.  That's issue #276.
+Until then, we have only a handful of strings actually translated,
+just to make it possible to demonstrate the framework
+is working correctly.
+
 
-Per the discussion in #275 the approach here is to start with
-ARB files and have dart autogenerate the bindings. I believe
-this is the most straightforward way when connecting with a
-translation management system, as they output ARB files that
-we consume (this is also the same way web and mobile works
-but with .po or .json files, I believe).

-Add the appropriate entry in `assets/l10n/app_en.arb` ensuring
-you add a corresponding resource attribute describing the

+To add a new string in the UI, start by
+adding an entry in the ARB file `assets/l10n/app_en.arb`.
+This includes a name that you choose for the string,
+its value in English,
+and a "resource attribute" describing the string in context.
+The name will become an identifier in our Dart code.
+The description will provide context for people contributing translations.
 
+For example, this entry describes a UI string
+named `profileButtonSendDirectMessage`
+which appears in English as "Send direct message":

-The bindings are automatically generated when you execute
-`flutter run` although you can also manually trigger it
-using `flutter gen-l10n`.
+Then run the app (with `flutter run` or in your IDE),
+or perform a hot reload,
+to cause the Dart bindings to be updated based on your
+changes to the ARB file.
+(You can also trigger an update directly, with `flutter gen-l10n`.)

+To use in our widgets, you need to import the generated bindings:
 ```
 import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/zulip_localizations.dart';
 ```
 
-And in your widget code pull the localizations out of the context:
+Then in your widget code, pull the localizations object
+off of the Flutter build context:
 ```
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   final zulipLocalizations = ZulipLocalizations.of(context);
 ```
 
-And finally access one of the generated properties:
-`Text(zulipLocalizations.chooseAccountButtonAddAnAccount)`.
+Finally, on the localizations object use the getter
+that was generated for the new string:
+`Text(zulipLocalizations.profileButtonSendDirectMessage)`.
+
+
+### Strings with placeholders
+
+When a UI string is a constant per language, with no placeholders,
+the generated Dart code provides a simple getter, as seen above.
+
+When the string takes a placeholder,
+the generated Dart binding for it will instead be a function,
+taking arguments corresponding to the placeholders.
 
-String that take placeholders are generated as functions
-that take arguments: `zulipLocalizations.subscribedToNStreams(store.subscriptions.length)`
+For example:
+`zulipLocalizations.subscribedToNStreams(store.subscriptions.length)`.
 
-## Hack to enforce locale (for testing, etc)
 
-To manually trigger a locale change for testing I've found
-it helpful to add the `localeResolutionCallback` in

+## Other notes
+
+Our approach uses the `flutter_localizations` package.
+We use the `gen_l10n` way, where we write ARB files
+and the tool generates the Dart bindings.
+
+As discussed in issue #275, the other way around was
+also an option.  But this way seems most straightforward
+when connecting with a translation management system,
+as they output ARB files that we consume.
+This also parallels how zulip-mobile works with `.json` files
+(and Zulip web, and the Zulip server with `.po` files?)
+
+A file `build/untranslated_messages.json` is emitted
+whenever the Dart bindings are generated from the ARB files.
+This output awaits #276.
