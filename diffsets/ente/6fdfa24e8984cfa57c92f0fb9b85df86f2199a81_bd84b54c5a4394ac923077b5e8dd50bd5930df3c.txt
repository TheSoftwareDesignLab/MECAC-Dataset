+# Translations
+
+We use Crowdin for translations, and the `i18next` library to load these at
+runtime.
+
+Within our project we have the _source_ strings - these are the key value pairs
+in the `public/locales/en-US/translation.json` file in each app.
+
+Volunteers can add a new _translation_ in their language corresponding to each
+such source key-value to our [Crowdin
+project](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-photos-web).
+
+Everyday, we run a [GitHub workflow](../../.github/workflows/web-crowdin.yml)
+that
+
+* Uploads sources to Crowdin - So any new key value pair we add in the source
+  `translation.json` becomes available to translators to translate.
+
+* Downloads translations from Crowdin - So any new translations that translators
+  have made on the Crowdin dashboard (for existing sources) will be added to the
+  corresponding `lang/translation.json`.
+
+The workflow also uploads existing translations and also downloads new sources
+from Crowdin, but these two should be no-ops.
+
+## Adding a new string
+
+- Add a new entry in `public/locales/en-US/translation.json` (the **source `translation.json`**).
+- Use the new key in code with the `t` function (`import { t } from "i18next"`).
+- During the next sync, the workflow will upload this source item to Crowdin's
+  dashboard, allowing translators to translate it.
+
+## Updating an existing string
+
+- Update the existing value for the key in the source `translation.json`.
+- During the next sync, the workflow will clear out all the existing
+  translations so that they can be translated afresh.
+
+## Deleting an existing string
+
+- Remove the key value pair from the source `translation.json`.
+- During the next sync, the workflow will delete that source item from all
+  existing translations (both in the Crowdin project and also from the he other
+  `lang/translation.json` files in the repository).
