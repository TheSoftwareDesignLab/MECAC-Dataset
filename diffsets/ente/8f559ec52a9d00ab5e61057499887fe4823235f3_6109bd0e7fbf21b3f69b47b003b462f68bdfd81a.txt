+SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+PREAMBLE
+The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
+development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
+efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
+open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
+with others.
+
+The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
+redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
+fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
+redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
+names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
+however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
+requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
+to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
+
+DEFINITIONS

+Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

-UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
--------------------------------
-
-PREAMBLE
-This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
-redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
-bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
-are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
-any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
-licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
-derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
-purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
-the fonts.
-
-DEFINITIONS
-"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
-Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
-include source files, build scripts and documentation.
-
-"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
-as received under this licence.
-
-"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
-or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
-Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
-a new environment.
-
-"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
-copyright ownership of the Font Software.
-
-"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
-identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
-Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
-
-To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
-permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
-infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
-computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
-distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
-a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
-countries other activities as well.
-
-PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
-This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
-rights are reserved.
-
-Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
-copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
-the below conditions:
-
-1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
-notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
-text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
-fields can be easily viewed by the user.
-
-2) The font name complies with the following:
-(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
-(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
-avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
-(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
-renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
-additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
-Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
-the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
-the new work, appended to that name.
-
-3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
-Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
-Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
-acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
-their explicit written permission.
-
-4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
-be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
-under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
-licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
-except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
-created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
-licence.
-
-TERMINATION
-This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
-not met.
-
-DISCLAIMER
-THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
-DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING

-DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
