+UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
+-------------------------------
+
+PREAMBLE
+This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
+redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
+bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
+are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
+any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
+licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
+derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
+purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
+the fonts.
+
+DEFINITIONS
+"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
+Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
+include source files, build scripts and documentation.
+
+"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
+as received under this licence.
+
+"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
+or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
+Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
+a new environment.
+
+"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
+copyright ownership of the Font Software.
+
+"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
+identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
+Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
+
+To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
+infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
+computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
+distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
+a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
+countries other activities as well.
+
+PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
+This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
+rights are reserved.
+
+Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
+copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
+the below conditions:
+
+1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
+notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
+text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
+readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
+fields can be easily viewed by the user.
+
+2) The font name complies with the following:
+(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
+(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
+avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
+(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
+renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
+additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
+Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
+the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
+the new work, appended to that name.
+
+3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
+Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
+Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
+acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
+their explicit written permission.
+
+4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
+be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
+under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
+licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
+except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
+created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
+licence.
+
+TERMINATION
+This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
+not met.
+
+DISCLAIMER
+THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
+EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
+COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
+COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
+DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
+FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER
+DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
