- ### How does Ente handle photos that are part of multiple iOS albums?
-When you select multiple albums for backup, Ente prioritizes uploading each photo to the album with the fewest photos. This means a photo will only be uploaded once, even if it exists in multiple albums on your device. If you create new albums on your device after the initial backup, those photos may not appear in the corresponding Ente album if they were already uploaded to a different album.

 ### Why don’t all photos from a new iOS album appear in the corresponding Ente album?

 ### How does the deduplication feature work on the desktop app?
-If the app finds exact duplicates, it will show them in the deduplication. When you delete a duplicate, the app keeps one copy and creates a symlink for the other duplicate. This helps save storage space.

 # Guide

+This guide aims to achieve self-hosting Ente photos or Ente-Auth with tailscale
+(TSDPROXY) without exposing any port OR if someone is behind CGNAT and cannot
+open any port on the internet but want to run their own selfhosted service for
+themselves, friends and family only.
 
 Before getting start keep the following NOTE in mind.
 
-> [!NOTE]
-> If someone is behind double or triple CGNAT; must install tailscale system wide by running `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh` in your linux terminal and `sudo tailscale up` otherwise dns resolver will fail and uploading will not work. This is not necessary for those who are not behing CGNAT.
-> This guide also work on docker rootless and normal.

-> [!CAUTION]
-Remember that current docker update 28.0.0 has some bug and cannot connect to external network. Make sure to install docker-ce 27.5.0, docker-ce-rootless-extras 27.5.0 and docker-ce-cli 27.5.0. Hopefully docker 28.1.0 will resolve this issue in next week.

-> [!IMPORTANT]
-> For Docker rootless, the user must have local permissions for all directories required by the Ente-photos self-hosted server. This can be achieved by running `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/ubuntu/docker/ente`. In the Linux terminal, you can check the UID with `id -u` or simply `id`. The first user typically has UID 1000.
-> To allow listening and pinging on any port without root privileges, create a file called `/etc/sysctl.d/99-rootless.conf` with the following content:
