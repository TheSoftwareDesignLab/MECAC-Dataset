+# Ente Photos Documentation Style Guide
+
+This guide ensures consistency across all Ente Photos documentation.
+
+## Voice and Tone
+
+### Use "Ente" or "Ente Photos"
+- ✅ "Ente backs up your photos automatically"
+- ✅ "Ente Photos provides end-to-end encryption"
+- ❌ "We back up your photos" (except in support/personal contexts)
+
+**Exception**: Use "we" when:
+- Offering support ("we'll be happy to help")
+- Making commitments ("we store 3 copies")
+- Explaining company decisions ("we chose this approach because...")
+
+### Imperative voice for instructions
+- ✅ "Open Settings and select Backup"
+- ❌ "You can open Settings and select Backup"
+- ❌ "Users should open Settings"
+
+## Terminology Standards
+
+### UI Elements
+- **Menu icon**: The three horizontal lines (☰) at top left
+- **Overflow menu**: The three dots (...) button
+- **Info button**: The (i) icon
+
+### Feature Names (Use exact capitalization)
+- **Settings** (not "settings" or "Preferences" on mobile)
+- **Preferences** (only on desktop)
+- **Backup** (not "backup" or "Back up" when referring to the feature)
+- **Albums** (capitalize when referring to the section)
+- **Uncategorized** (capitalize - it's a special album)
+- **Trash** (capitalize - it's a special section)
+- **Hidden** (capitalize when referring to the special section)
+- **Archive** (capitalize when referring to the section)
+
+### Platform Names
+- **iOS** (not "IOS" or "ios")
+- **Android** (capitalize)
+- **macOS** (not "Mac OS" or "MacOS")
+- **Windows** (capitalize)
+- **Linux** (capitalize)
+
+### Action Consistency
+- **Tap** (mobile) vs. **Click** (desktop/web)
+- **Open** (for UI elements, menus, settings, tabs, sections)
+  - ✅ "Open `Settings > Backup`"
+  - ✅ "Open the Albums tab"
+  - ✅ "Open sharing settings"
+  - ❌ "Go to Settings" (use "Open" instead)
+  - ❌ "Navigate to the Albums tab" (use "Open" instead)
+  - **Exception**: "Go to [URL]" is acceptable when directing users to external websites
+- **Select** (for choosing from options)
+- **Enable/Disable** (for toggles)
+- **Enter** (for text input)
+
+### Path Navigation
+Use consistent format with `>` separator:
+- **Settings > Backup > Backed up folders**
+- **Preferences > Advanced > Machine learning**
+
+### Links and References
+- **"Learn more"** (standard phrase for linking to detailed guides)
+  - ✅ "Learn more in the [Feature guide](#)"
+  - ✅ "Learn more about [Topic](#)"
+  - ❌ "For more details, see..." (use "Learn more" instead)
+  - ❌ "Read more here:" (use "Learn more" instead)
+  - ❌ "See more at..." (use "Learn more" instead)
+- **"See [Page Name](#)"** (for direct references in prose)
+- **Internal links**: Always use title case for link text
+
+## Formatting Standards
+
+### Headings
+- H1 (`#`): Page title only
+- H2 (`##`): Major sections
+- H3 (`###`): Subsections / FAQ questions
+- H4 (`####`): Sub-subsections (use sparingly)
+
+**Spacing**: H3 headings automatically have increased top margin (48px) for better visual separation between sections, especially important in FAQ pages with many consecutive questions. This is handled by CSS - no manual spacing needed.
+
+### Emphasis
+- **Bold**: UI elements, important warnings, section labels
+  - Example: **On mobile:** or **Important:**
+- *Italic*: Emphasis, terminology introduction (use sparingly)
+- `Code`: File paths, commands, technical values
+
+### Lists
+- Use `-` for unordered lists (consistent)
+- Use `1.` for numbered steps
+- Use sub-bullets for nested information
+
+### Notes and Warnings
+Use blockquotes with bold labels:
+```markdown
+> **Note**: Additional context here.
+> **Important**: Critical information.
+> **Warning**: Something that could cause data loss.
+```
+
+### Code Blocks
+Always specify language:
+```markdown
+```bash
+command here
+```
+```
+
+### FAQ Question Format
+Always use H3 with mandatory anchor for deep linking:
+```markdown
+### Question text here? {#your-anchor-id}
+```
+
+**Anchor ID requirements:**
+- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
+- Make anchors descriptive and meaningful
+- Must be unique across ALL FAQ files (not just within one file)
+- ✅ `{#enable-face-recognition-ml}`
+- ✅ `{#backup-slow-speed}`
+- ❌ `{#faq1}` (not descriptive)
+- ❌ Duplicate anchors across different FAQ files
+
+**Testing for duplicates:**
+```bash
+# Run this command to check for duplicate anchor IDs:
+grep -rh "{#[a-z0-9-]*}" docs/photos/faq/*.md | sed 's/.*{#\([^}]*\)}.*/\1/' | sort | uniq -d
+```
+
+## Content Structure
+
+### Feature Pages
+Should include:
+1. Title and brief description
+2. Main content sections
+3. Platform-specific instructions (if applicable)
+4. **Related FAQs** section at bottom
+
+### FAQ Pages
+Should include:
+1. Title
+2. Groups of related questions (H2 sections)
+3. Questions as H3
+4. Clear, concise answers with links to detailed guides
+5. **Related Features** section at bottom (optional)
+
+### Getting Started Pages
+Should include:
+1. Title and context
+2. Step-by-step instructions
+3. Platform-specific notes
+4. **FAQs** section
+5. **Next steps** section
+
+## Cross-Linking Best Practices
+
+### Always link to:
+- Related feature pages from FAQ answers
+- Related FAQ from feature pages
+- Next logical steps in getting started guides
+- Troubleshooting from relevant feature pages
+
+### Link text should:
+- Be descriptive (not "click here")
+- Use the target page's title
+- Be consistent across the docs
+
+## Platform-Specific Guidance
+
+When providing platform-specific instructions, use bold headers:
+```markdown
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open `Settings > Backup`
+2. Select the albums to back up
+
+**On desktop:**
+1. Open `Preferences > Backup`
+2. Configure watch folders
+
+**On web:**
+1. Click the menu icon
+2. Select Export
+```
+
+**Platform header variations:**
+- `**On mobile:**` - Generic mobile (both iOS and Android)
+- `**On iOS:**` - iOS-specific instructions
+- `**On Android:**` - Android-specific instructions
+- `**On desktop:**` - Desktop app (all platforms)
+- `**On web:**` - Web browser interface
+- `**On web/desktop:**` - When instructions are identical for web and desktop
+- `**On mobile and web:**` - When instructions are identical for mobile and web
+
+**Always bold the platform headers** - never use plain text like "On mobile:" without bold formatting.
+
+## Common Patterns
+
+### Prerequisites
+When needed, start with:
+```markdown
+**Prerequisites:**
+- Item one
+- Item two
+```
+
+### Time Estimates
+Include when relevant:
+```markdown
+This may take 10-30 minutes for large libraries.
+```
+
+### Version/Platform Notes
+```markdown
+> **Note**: This feature is available on mobile apps starting v0.9.98.
+```
+
+## Examples
+
+### Good Example
+```markdown
+### How do I enable face recognition? {#enable-face-recognition-example}
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning`
+2. Enable "Face recognition"
+3. Wait for indexing to complete
+
+**On desktop:**
+1. Open `Preferences > Machine learning`
+2. Enable "Face recognition"
+3. Monitor indexing progress
+
+The app will download your photos to index them. This is faster over WiFi.
+
+Learn more in the [Machine learning guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning).
+```
+
+### Bad Example
+```markdown
+### How to enable face recognition?
+
+On mobile you can enable face recognition in the settings. Go to the three horizontal lines button at the top left, then go to General, then Advanced, and you'll find Machine learning where you can enable it.
+
+For more details, see: /photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning
+```
+
+**What's wrong with the bad example:**
+- ❌ Missing anchor ID (should have `{#unique-anchor-id}`)
+- ❌ "Go to" instead of "Open"
+- ❌ Platform header not bolded
+- ❌ "For more details, see" instead of "Learn more"
+- ❌ Lacks clear numbered steps
+- ❌ Missing code formatting for Settings paths
+
+## Checklist for New Content
+
+### General
+- [ ] Used consistent terminology from this guide
+- [ ] Followed formatting standards
+- [ ] Used imperative voice for instructions ("Open Settings" not "You can open Settings")
+- [ ] Used proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
+
+### FAQ-Specific
+- [ ] All H3 questions have unique anchor IDs (format: `{#descriptive-anchor}`)
+- [ ] Verified no duplicate anchor IDs across all FAQ files (run the grep command)
+- [ ] Used "Open" for UI navigation (not "Go to" or "Navigate to")
+- [ ] Platform headers are bold: `**On mobile:**` `**On desktop:**` `**On web:**`
+- [ ] Settings paths use code format: `` `Settings > Backup > Folders` ``
+
+### Links and Cross-References
+- [ ] Used "Learn more" consistently (not "See more", "For more details", "Read more")
+- [ ] Added cross-links to related feature pages
+- [ ] Checked all internal links work correctly
+- [ ] Link text uses title case and is descriptive
+
+### Platform Instructions
+- [ ] Specified platforms where relevant with bold headers
+- [ ] Provided mobile, desktop, and/or web instructions as needed
+- [ ] Used platform-appropriate action verbs (Tap vs Click)

+
+### How do I install Ente Photos on my Android phone? {#install-android}

+
+### How do I install Ente Photos on my iPhone or iPad? {#install-ios}
+
+You can install Ente Photos on your iPhone or iPad from the [iOS AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1542026904).
+
+### How do I install Ente Photos on my desktop? {#install-desktop}
+
+You can install Ente Photos on your desktop by downloading the installer from [our website](https://ente.io/download/desktop).
+
+**Supported platforms:**
+- **Windows**: Download and run the installer
+- **macOS**: Download the DMG file
+- **Linux**: Download the installer or AppImage
+
+### How do I install CLI for Ente Photos? {#install-cli}
+
+Ente's CLI is distributed directly over [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0). The CLI is useful for:
+- Automated exports to NAS or local storage
+- Bulk operations
+- Server-to-server transfers
+
+### Can I access Ente Photos from my browser? {#web-app}
+
+Yes. Ente Photos is also available on the web at [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io). It offers most of the functionality of the desktop app, except for machine learning and generating video streams.
+
+You don't need to install anything - just log in with your email and password.
+
+### Why is the latest version not available on F-Droid? {#fdroid-delay}
+
+Releases over F-Droid are generally slower than other stores since they run their own build servers. The latest updates are usually available within 2 weeks of release.

+After creating your account on one device, you can log in to Ente Photos on all your other devices:
+
+1. Install Ente Photos on the device (see installation guides above)
+2. Open the app and select "Existing user"
+3. Enter your email address and password
+4. You may be asked to verify your email with a 6-digit code
+5. Once logged in, your photos will begin syncing automatically
+
+Your entire photo library will sync to this device, and any new photos you back up from any device will appear everywhere.
+
+Learn more in [Creating an account and logging in](/photos/getting-started/signup).
+
+### Can I use Ente on both mobile and desktop? {#mobile-and-desktop}
+
+Yes! You can use Ente Photos on as many devices as you want:
+- Install on multiple phones and tablets
+- Install on multiple computers
+- Use the web app in any browser
+- All devices stay in sync automatically
+
+Each device can have its own backup configuration (which albums to back up on mobile, which folders to watch on desktop).
+
+### Do I need separate accounts for different devices? {#separate-accounts}
+
+No. Use the same account across all your devices. Your photos, albums, and all your data will sync seamlessly across all devices where you're logged in.
+
+Only use separate accounts if you want to keep photo libraries completely separate (for example, personal vs. work photos).
+
+## Account Creation & Security
+
+### How do I create a new Ente account? {#create-account}
+
+When you first open Ente Photos, you'll be guided through account creation:
+
+1. **Enter your email address** and verify it with a code
+2. **Create a strong password** (this encrypts all your photos)
+3. **Save your recovery key** - this is critical for account recovery
+4. **Choose a plan** - Start with 10 GB free or select a paid plan
+
+For a detailed walkthrough, see [Creating an account](/photos/getting-started/signup).
+
+### What is the recovery key and why is it important? {#recovery-key}
+
+Your recovery key is the **only way** to recover your account if you:
+- Forget your password
+- Are logged out of all devices
+
+Since Ente uses end-to-end encryption, we cannot reset your password without your recovery key.
+
+**How to save it:**
+- Write it down on paper and store it safely
+- Save it in a password manager
+- Store it in any secure location you trust
+
+**Never skip this step!** Without your recovery key, losing your password means permanently losing access to your photos.
+
+### How do I reset my password if I lost it? {#reset-password}
+
+On the login page:
+1. Enter your email
+2. Click "Forgot Password"
+3. Enter your recovery key
+4. Create a new password
+
+If you don't have your recovery key and are logged out of all devices, we cannot recover your account due to end-to-end encryption.
+
+### Can I change my password later? {#change-password-later}
+
+Yes, you can change your password at any time from Settings. Ente's architecture allows password changes without re-encrypting your entire library.
+
+The privacy of your account depends on password strength - choose a strong one.
+
+### Does Ente support two-factor authentication (2FA)? {#2fa}
+
+Yes! Ente recommends enabling 2FA for additional security. Supported methods include:
+- **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
+- **WebAuthn/FIDO2** for hardware security keys
+- **Passkeys** as an alternative 2FA mechanism
+
+You can set up 2FA in Settings on mobile or desktop apps.
+
+Learn more in our [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy).
+
+### Can I use passkeys instead of passwords? {#use-passkeys}
+
+Passkeys serve as a second factor (2FA) for your Ente account, not as a replacement for your password. When you add a passkey to your account, it will be used instead of TOTP codes for two-factor authentication.
+
+Passkeys use strong cryptography built into your devices (like Windows Hello or Apple's Touch ID), providing a more secure and convenient 2FA method than traditional codes.
+
+Learn more in the [Passkeys feature guide](/photos/features/account/passkeys).
+
+### What happens if I lose my passkey? {#lost-passkey}
+
+If you lose access to your passkey (for example, if you misplace a hardware security key), you can recover your account using your Ente recovery key.
+
+**To recover:**
+1. During login, press cancel on the browser dialog asking for passkey verification
+2. Select "Recover two-factor" in the error message
+3. Enter your Ente recovery key to log in
+4. Go to the Passkey settings page to delete the lost passkey and/or add a new one
+
+If you've lost both your passkey and recovery key, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) for assistance.
+
+### I'm not receiving the verification code email {#verification-code}
+
+If you're not receiving verification codes:
+
+1. Check your spam/junk folder
+2. Wait a few minutes - emails can be delayed
+3. Try requesting a new code
+4. Make sure you entered the correct email address
+5. Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) if the issue persists
+
+### What if I lose access to my email address? {#lost-email}
+
+The recovery key does not bypass email verification. For security reasons, Ente does not disable or bypass email verification unless the account owner reaches out and successfully verifies their identity by providing account details.
+
+If you lose access to your email, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io).

+title: Advanced Features FAQ
+description: Frequently asked questions about CLI, exports, and advanced features in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Advanced Features
+
+## Command Line Interface (CLI)
+
+### What is the Ente CLI? {#what-is-cli}
+
+The Ente CLI is a command-line tool for advanced users that allows you to:
+- Export your entire library or specific albums to local storage
+- Set up automated exports with cron jobs
+- Sync data to NAS or other storage systems
+- Perform bulk operations
+
+The CLI is particularly useful for:
+- Regular automated backups to local/NAS storage
+- Server-to-server transfers
+- Power users who prefer command-line tools
+
+For complete details, see the [CLI feature guide](/photos/features/utilities/cli).
+
+### How do I install the CLI? {#install-cli-advanced}
+
+Ente's CLI is distributed directly over [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0).
+
+Download the appropriate version for your platform and follow the installation instructions in the [CLI README](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme).
+
+Learn more in the [CLI installation guide](/photos/features/utilities/cli#installation).
+
+### How do I use the CLI to export my photos? {#cli-export-photos}
+
+The CLI supports incremental exports, which means it will only download new or changed files:
+
+```bash
+# Export all photos
+ente export
+
+# Export to specific directory
+ente export --dir /path/to/backup
+
+# Export specific album
+ente export --album "Album Name"
+```
+
+The exports are incremental and will gracefully handle interruptions - you can safely stop and restart without re-downloading everything.
+
+For complete documentation, see the [CLI feature guide](/photos/features/utilities/cli#basic-usage).
+
+### How do I keep NAS and Ente photos synced? {#nas-sync}
+
+The recommended approach is to use the CLI to pull data from Ente to your NAS:
+
+1. Install the CLI on your NAS or a machine that can access it
+2. Set up a cron job to run periodic exports
+3. Use the CLI's incremental export feature
+
+Example cron job for daily sync:
+```bash
+0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/ente export --dir /nas/ente-backup
+```
+
+See the [CLI NAS sync guide](/photos/features/utilities/cli#nas-sync-setup) for detailed setup.
+
+**Note**: Two-way sync is not currently supported. The CLI pulls data from Ente to your local storage.
+
+### CLI not found after installation {#cli-not-found}
+
+Make sure the CLI binary is in your PATH or use the full path to execute it.
+
+### CLI authentication issues {#cli-auth-issues}
+
+If login fails, try:
+- Verify your email and password are correct
+- Check your internet connection
+- Ensure you're using the latest CLI version
+
+### CLI export interruptions {#cli-export-interruptions}
+
+The CLI handles interruptions gracefully. Simply run the export command again - it will resume from where it stopped.
+
+### NAS export issues with CLI {#cli-nas-export}
+
+If exporting to NAS using CLI:
+- Ensure the NAS mount is accessible
+- Check write permissions on the destination folder
+- Use a local path if the NAS is mounted on your system
+
+## Exporting from Desktop/Web
+
+### How can I backup my data locally outside Ente? {#local-backup}
+
+You can use our CLI tool or our desktop app to set up exports of your data to your local drive. This way, you can use Ente in your day to day use, with an additional guarantee that a copy of your original photos and videos are always available on your machine.
+
+**Desktop app**:
+
+Open `Settings > Export data`, choose a destination folder, and enable "Continuous export" to automatically export new items.
+
+**CLI**:
+Use [Ente's CLI](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#export) to export your data in a cron job to a location of your choice. The exports are incremental, and will also gracefully handle interruptions.
+
+For complete details, see the [Export feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export).
+
+### Does the exported data preserve album structure? {#export-album-structure}
+
+Yes. When you export your data for local backup, it will maintain the exact album structure how you have set up within Ente.
+
+Each album becomes a separate folder, and photos are organized accordingly.
+
+Learn more about [Export album structure](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export#album-structure).
+
+### Does the exported data preserve metadata? {#export-preserves-metadata}
+
+Yes, the metadata is written out to a separate JSON file during export. Note that the original is not modified.
+
+When you export, suppose you have `flower.png`. You will end up with:
+
+```
+flower.png
+metadata/flower.png.json
+```
+
+Ente writes this JSON in the same format as Google Takeout so that if a tool supports Google Takeout import, it should be able to read the JSON written by Ente too.
+
+Learn more about the metadata format in the [Metadata and Editing FAQ](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing#export-data-preserve-metadata).
+
+### Can I do a 2-way sync with exports? {#export-two-way-sync}
+
+No, two-way sync is not currently supported. Exports create a one-way sync from Ente to your local storage.
+
+Attempting to export data to the same folder that is also being watched by the Ente app (for uploads) will result in undefined behavior (e.g. duplicate files, export stalling etc).
+
+**Use separate folders for:**
+- **Upload source** (watch folders)
+- **Export destination** (local backups)
+
+Learn more about [Export limitations](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export#export-limitations).
+
+### Why is my export size larger than my backed-up size in Ente? {#export-size-larger}
+
+One possible reason could be that you have files that are in multiple different albums. Whenever a file is backed-up to Ente in multiple albums it will still count only once towards the total storage in Ente. However, during export that file will be downloaded multiple times to the different folders corresponding to said albums, causing the total export size to be larger.
+
+**Example:**
+- Photo `sunset.jpg` is in albums "Vacation" and "Best Photos"
+- In Ente: Counts as 1 file (storage counted once)
+- On export: Appears in both `Vacation/` and `Best Photos/` folders (downloaded twice)
+
+Learn more about [Files in multiple albums](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export#files-in-multiple-albums).
+
+### Can I export to a network drive (NAS)? {#export-to-nas}
+
+Generally, exports are likely to work better than imports when using network drives, since the interaction with the file system is relatively simpler.
+
+**Important note**: If you're exporting to a UNC path (Windows network path like `\\server\share`), the file separators will not work as expected and the export will not start. As a workaround, map your UNC path to a network drive letter and use that instead.
+
+Learn more about [Export to NAS](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export#network-drives-nas).
+
+### How do I set up continuous exports? {#continuous-export}
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Export data`, choose your export folder, and enable "Continuous export".
+
+With continuous export enabled, the app will automatically export new items in the background without you needing to run any manual exports or cron jobs.
+
+The desktop app needs to be running for continuous export to work.
+
+Learn more about [Desktop continuous export](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export#desktopweb-continuous-export).
+
+## Utilities
+
+### What is video streaming in Ente? {#video-streaming}
+
+Video streaming is a beta feature that lets you watch videos without downloading the entire file first. Ente generates streamable versions (HLS format) that support instant playback and seeking.
+
+For complete details, see the [Video Streaming feature guide](/photos/features/utilities/video-streaming).
+
+### What is a stream technically? {#what-is-a-stream}
+
+A stream is an encrypted HLS file with a `.m3u8` playlist. Ente converts videos to 720p at 2mbps in H.264 format. The stream is encrypted with AES and the playlist with XChaCha20.
+
+Due to encryption, Ente cannot read the contents, duration, or number of chunks within the generated stream.
+
+### Will streams consume space in my storage? {#stream-storage}
+
+While video streaming is in beta, streams do not count against your storage quota. This may change in the future, with options to keep originals only, streams only, or both.
+
+### Video streaming isn't working correctly, what should I do? {#stream-issues}
+
+Video streaming is still in beta. If something isn't working:
+- Create a thread in `#feedback` on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/948937918347608085/1121126215995113552)
+- Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io)
+
+For crashes or upload failures with streaming enabled, see [Troubleshooting](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#app-crashes-ml-video).
+
+### How does Cast work? {#how-does-cast-work}
+
+Ente Cast lets you play slideshow albums on Chromecast TVs or any internet-connected large screen. You can pair using auto-pair (Chromium browsers with Chromecast) or PIN pairing (works with any device).
+
+For setup instructions, see the [Cast feature guide](/photos/features/utilities/cast/).
+
+### Can I use Cast without Chromecast? {#cast-without-chromecast}
+
+Yes! Use the "Pair with PIN" option which works with any device. Load [cast.ente.io](https://cast.ente.io) on your large screen device and enter the displayed PIN on your mobile or web device.
+
+### App crashes with video streaming enabled {#app-crashes-video-streaming}
+
+If the app crashes when watching videos or using machine learning, especially on iOS or older devices:
+
+1. Open `Settings > General > Advanced`
+2. Disable "Video streaming" or "Enable video playback"
+3. Disable "Machine learning" if crashes continue
+4. Restart the app
+
+The combination of ML processing and video streaming can exceed available memory on older devices.
+
+### Video upload failures with streaming enabled {#video-upload-failures-streaming}
+
+Large video uploads may fail when streaming is enabled, especially on mobile:
+
+1. Temporarily disable video streaming
+2. Upload the videos
+3. Re-enable video streaming after upload completes
+
+### My device isn't showing up in Auto Pair for Cast {#cast-auto-pair-not-working}
+
+- Ensure your device and Chromecast are on the same WiFi network
+- Check that your Chromecast is properly set up and visible on your network
+- Try the "Pair with PIN" option as an alternative
+
+### PIN pairing isn't working for Cast {#cast-pin-not-working}
+
+- Verify that [cast.ente.io](https://cast.ente.io) is loaded on your large screen device
+- Check that both devices have internet connectivity
+- Make sure you're entering the PIN exactly as displayed (case-sensitive)
+- The PIN expires after a short time - refresh for a new PIN if needed
+
+### Photos aren't appearing on the TV {#cast-photos-not-appearing}
+
+- Allow a few moments for the initial connection and loading
+- Check that the album you selected has photos in it
+- Verify your internet connection on both devices
+- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
+
+### What types of notifications does Ente send? {#notification-types}
+
+Ente can send notifications for:
+- New photos added to shared albums
+- "On this day" memories from previous years
+- Birthday reminders for tagged people
+
+Notifications are currently only available on mobile apps. See the [Notifications feature guide](/photos/features/utilities/notifications) for details.
+
+### How do I manage notification settings? {#manage-notifications}
+
+Open `Settings > General > Notifications` to enable or disable specific notification categories. All categories are enabled by default when you grant notification permission.
+
+## Other Advanced Features
+
+### Can I access Ente from multiple browsers? {#multiple-browsers}
+
+Yes! You can access Ente from any browser by going to [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io) and logging in with your credentials.
+
+Your data syncs across all browsers and devices where you're logged in.
+
+### Does Ente have an API? {#api}
+
+Ente does not currently have a public API for third-party integrations.
+
+However, the CLI provides programmatic access to many features for advanced users. The CLI is open source, so you can also review or extend it for your specific needs.
+
+### Can I self-host Ente? {#self-hosting}
+
+Yes! Ente is open source and can be self-hosted. See our [self-hosting documentation](/self-hosting/) for complete setup instructions.
+
+Note that these FAQs are primarily for Ente's cloud service. Self-hosting has additional considerations documented separately.
+
+### How do I report bugs or request features? {#report-bugs}
+
+You can:
+1. **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features on [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/issues)
+2. **Discord**: Join our [Discord community](https://ente.io/discord) for discussions
+3. **Email**: Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io)
+
+For security vulnerabilities, please email [security@ente.io](mailto:security@ente.io) directly.

+title: Albums and Organization FAQ
+description: Frequently asked questions about organizing photos with albums, hiding, archiving, and deletion in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Albums and Organization
+
+## Albums {#albums-section}
+
+### Can Ente albums be nested? {#nested-albums}
+
+No, Ente albums cannot be nested currently. When you upload a nested folder structure using the "Separate albums" option, Ente will create a separate album for each nested folder, but these albums themselves will not be nested - they will all appear as top-level albums.
+
+For example, if you have folders organized as `Photos/2024/Summer/Beach`, Ente will create separate albums but display them as a flat list rather than maintaining the hierarchical structure.
+
+### What happens when I upload a nested folder structure? {#nested-folders}
+
+When you upload a folder with nested subfolders using the desktop app, you'll see two options:
+
+**Single album**: Creates one Ente album with the parent folder's name and syncs all files from all nested folders into this single album.
+
+**Separate albums**: Creates separate albums for each nested folder. Only the leafmost folder name is used for the album name. For example, both `A/B/C/D/x.png` and `1/2/3/D/y.png` will be uploaded into the same Ente album named "D".
+
+Note that in separate album mode:
+- Only nested folders with at least one file will create an album
+- Empty folders (or folders containing only other folders) will be ignored
+
+### Can I sync a folder with multiple subfolders? {#sync-subfolders}
+
+Yes! When you drag and drop a folder with multiple subfolders onto the desktop app, Ente will detect the structure and prompt you to choose between creating a single album or separate albums for each folder.
+
+This works for:
+- Drag and drop operations
+- Upload selector
+- [Watch folders](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#watch-folders) setup
+
+The app will intelligently handle the folder structure based on your preference.
+
+### Why don't all photos from a new iOS album appear in the corresponding Ente album? {#ios-album-sync}
+
+If you create a new album on your iOS device after the initial backup, the photos in that album may have already been uploaded to another album in Ente.
+
+When you select multiple albums for backup, Ente prioritizes uploading each photo to the album with the fewest photos. This means a photo will only be uploaded once, even if it exists in multiple albums on your device.
+
+**To fix this**: Open the "On Device" album in Ente, select all photos, and manually add them to the corresponding album in Ente.
+
+### What happens if I reorganize my photos in the iOS Photos app after backing up? {#ios-reorganize}
+
+Reorganizing photos in the iOS Photos app (e.g., moving photos to new albums) won't automatically reflect in Ente. You'll need to manually add those photos to the corresponding albums in Ente to maintain consistency.
+
+This is because iOS doesn't notify apps when photos are moved between albums - apps only see when new photos are added to the device.
+
+### How does Ente handle photos that are part of multiple iOS albums? {#multiple-ios-albums}
+
+When you select multiple albums for backup, Ente prioritizes uploading each photo to the album with the fewest photos. This means a photo will only be uploaded once, even if it exists in multiple albums on your device. If you create new albums on your device after the initial backup, those photos may not appear in the corresponding Ente album if they were already uploaded to a different album.
+
+## Uncategorized
+
+### What is the Uncategorized album? {#what-is-uncategorized}
+
+Uncategorized is a special system album in Ente where photos are automatically placed when they don't belong to any other album. It acts as a catch-all location to prevent photos from being lost when they're removed from all regular albums.
+
+Photos appear in Uncategorized when:
+- You remove a photo from its last remaining album
+- You delete an album but choose to keep the photos
+- You delete a file from a [watched folder](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#watch-folders) on desktop
+
+Learn more in the [Uncategorized feature guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/uncategorized).
+
+### Why are photos appearing in Uncategorized? {#why-uncategorized}
+
+Photos automatically move to Uncategorized in these situations:
+
+**When you remove from last album**: If you remove a photo from the only album it belongs to, it goes to Uncategorized instead of being deleted.
+
+**When deleting albums**: If you delete an album and choose "Keep photos", any photos that were exclusively in that album move to Uncategorized.
+
+**When deleting from watched folders**: On desktop, if you delete a file from a folder being watched by Ente, the corresponding photo in Ente moves to Uncategorized (it's not permanently deleted).
+
+**Note**: Photos uploaded by others (from shared albums) do not go to Uncategorized when removed.
+
+### How do I clean up Uncategorized items? {#clean-uncategorized}
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the Uncategorized album
+2. Tap the three dots (overflow menu)
+3. Select "Clean Uncategorized"
+
+This will automatically remove all files from Uncategorized that are also present in another album that you own. Only files exclusive to Uncategorized will remain.
+
+**Manual cleanup:**
+You can also manually:
+- Add photos from Uncategorized to specific albums
+- Delete photos you don't need from Uncategorized
+- Move photos to appropriate albums by selecting them and choosing "Add to album"
+
+### Can I delete the Uncategorized album? {#delete-uncategorized}
+
+No, you cannot delete the Uncategorized album itself because it's a system album. However, you can:
+- Delete individual photos from Uncategorized
+- Use "Clean Uncategorized" to remove photos that exist in other albums
+- Empty it completely by deleting all photos within it
+
+The Uncategorized album will always exist as a container for photos without other albums.
+
+### Do photos in Uncategorized count against my storage? {#uncategorized-storage}
+
+Yes, photos in Uncategorized count towards your storage quota just like photos in any other album. If you want to free up storage, you'll need to delete photos from Uncategorized (they'll move to Trash for 30 days before permanent deletion).
+
+### Can I organize photos in Uncategorized? {#organize-uncategorized}
+
+Yes! Photos in Uncategorized work just like photos in regular albums. You can:
+- View them by date
+- Search for them
+- Add them to other albums (recommended to keep them organized)
+- Delete them if you don't need them
+- Share individual photos
+
+The best practice is to periodically review Uncategorized and add photos to appropriate albums or delete ones you don't need.
+
+### What happens if I add an Uncategorized photo to an album? {#add-from-uncategorized}
+
+When you add a photo from Uncategorized to another album:
+- The photo will appear in both the new album AND Uncategorized
+- It will remain in Uncategorized unless you use "Clean Uncategorized"
+- Running "Clean Uncategorized" will remove it from Uncategorized since it now exists in another album
+
+This behavior ensures photos aren't accidentally lost.
+
+### Why do some photos stay in Uncategorized after cleaning? {#photos-stay-uncategorized}
+
+The "Clean Uncategorized" function only removes photos that exist in at least one other album that you own. Photos remain in Uncategorized if:
+- They don't exist in any other album yet
+- They only exist in albums shared by others (not albums you own)
+- They were uploaded by others in collaborative albums
+
+If you want these photos organized, manually add them to appropriate albums.
+
+### Can I prevent photos from going to Uncategorized? {#prevent-uncategorized}
+
+Not directly, but you can minimize it:
+
+1. **Be careful when removing from albums**: Before removing a photo from an album, check if it exists in other albums
+2. **Use "Delete album and photos" option**: When deleting albums, choose to delete photos too if you don't need them
+3. **Organize regularly**: Ensure photos belong to at least one album before removing them from others
+4. **For watched folders**: Keep files in watched folders or move them to another watched folder instead of deleting them
+
+### How do I view Uncategorized photos? {#view-uncategorized}
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Open the Albums tab
+- Scroll to the bottom
+- Tap on "Uncategorized"
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Click the hamburger menu (three lines) in the top left
+- Select "Uncategorized"
+
+The Uncategorized section shows all photos that aren't in any other album you own.
+
+## Hide vs Archive {#hide-vs-archive}
+
+### What's the difference between hiding and archiving? {#difference}
+
+**Hiding** provides maximum privacy - hidden photos are completely removed from everywhere in the app (timeline, albums, search results) except the special "Hidden" section, which requires biometric authentication (FaceID/TouchID) or your device passcode to access.
+
+**Archiving** is for decluttering - archived photos are only removed from your home timeline and memories, but still appear in albums and search results. No authentication is required to view archived items. Use archiving when you want to clean up your timeline (e.g., old screenshots) without completely hiding the content.
+
+For detailed guides, see [Hide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/hide) and [Archive](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/archive).
+
+### Can I hide photos that are shared with me? {#hide-shared}
+
+No, you cannot hide photos or albums that are shared with you by other users. However, you can archive shared albums to remove them from your timeline. The "Hide" feature only works on content that you own.
+
+### Do archived photos appear in search results? {#archive-search}
+
+Yes, archived photos still appear in search results and in their respective albums. Archiving only removes photos from your home timeline and memories section. If you want photos completely hidden from search results too, use the "Hide" feature instead of archiving.
+
+### How do I hide photos in Ente? {#how-to-hide}
+
+Open the photo, tap the three dots menu (overflow menu), and select "Hide" (the action with the eye icon). Hidden items will only be accessible from the special "Hidden" category at the bottom of the Albums screen, which requires biometric authentication to view.
+
+**Note**: Hidden items may still appear in "On device" albums within Ente as long as they're present in your native device gallery. Once you remove them from your device, they'll stop showing up there.
+
+### How do I archive photos in Ente? {#how-to-archive}
+
+Long press to select the photo(s) you want to archive, then select "Archive" from the bottom menu. To archive an entire album, open the album, tap the three dots menu, and select "Archive album". You can view archived content anytime by going to the "Archive" section (no authentication required).
+
+## Storage Management
+
+### How can I free up space on my device? {#free-up-device-space}
+
+Once your photos are backed up to Ente, you can safely delete them from your device to reclaim storage space:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Free up space`, review the amount of space that will be freed, and confirm to delete backed-up photos from your device.
+
+Your photos remain in Ente and will be automatically downloaded when you view them in the app.
+
+Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+### How can I remove duplicate photos from my library? {#remove-duplicates}
+
+If you have exact duplicate files across different albums, you can use the manual deduplication tool:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Free up space > Remove duplicates`, review the duplicates found, and confirm to remove them.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Deduplicate files`, review the duplicates found, and confirm to remove them.
+
+This keeps one copy of each unique file and creates symlinks in all albums, freeing up storage while maintaining your album structure.
+
+Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+### How can I find and remove similar photos? {#remove-similar}
+
+Ente's ML-powered similar images feature helps you find visually similar (but not identical) photos:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Free up space > Similar images`, review each group of similar photos, choose which to keep and which to delete, and confirm your selections.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Desktop doesn't have a "Similar images" feature. Use the mobile app for AI-powered similar image detection.
+
+Ente intelligently manages symlinks to ensure no album loses all photos from a scene.
+
+Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+### Will I lose my photos when freeing up device space? {#free-up-space-safe}
+
+No! Freeing up device space only removes local copies from your device. All photos remain safely stored in Ente's encrypted cloud and can be viewed or re-downloaded anytime.
+
+### Can I choose which photos to delete from my device? {#selective-device-deletion}
+
+Currently, the "Free up space" feature removes all backed-up photos at once. If you want selective deletion, manually delete specific photos from your device's gallery app.
+
+### How much space will I free up? {#how-much-space-freed}
+
+The app will show you the exact amount before you confirm. This is typically the total size of all backed-up photos and videos on your device.
+
+### Will new photos still backup automatically after freeing up space? {#backup-after-free-space}
+
+Yes! After freeing up space, new photos you take will continue to backup automatically to Ente.
+
+### What's the difference between duplicates and similar images? {#duplicates-vs-similar}
+
+- **Duplicates**: Exact same file (identical hash) - automatically detected during upload
+- **Exact duplicates tool**: Finds and removes exact duplicates across your entire library
+- **Similar images**: Visually similar but not identical photos - uses ML to detect
+
+Learn more in [Storage optimization](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+### Does removing duplicates affect automatic duplicate detection? {#manual-vs-auto-dedup}
+
+No. Automatic duplicate detection during upload continues to work regardless of whether you use the manual deduplication tool.
+
+Learn more about [Duplicate detection during backup](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).
+
+## Trash and Deletion {#trash}
+
+### How do I delete photos in Ente? {#delete-photos}
+
+When you delete a photo or video in Ente, it's moved to Trash rather than being permanently deleted immediately.
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Long press to select the photo(s) you want to delete
+- Tap the trash icon in the action bar
+- Confirm the deletion
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Select the photo(s) you want to delete
+- Click the trash icon or press the Delete key
+- Confirm the deletion
+
+Deleted items remain in Trash for 30 days before being permanently deleted automatically.
+
+Learn more in the [Trash feature guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/trash).
+
+### How do I restore deleted photos? {#restore-photos}
+
+If you accidentally deleted photos, you can restore them from Trash within 30 days:
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Open the Albums tab
+- Scroll to the bottom and tap "Trash"
+- Select the photos you want to restore
+- Tap the "Restore" button
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Open the sidebar menu
+- Click on "Trash"
+- Select the items to restore
+- Click the "Restore" button
+
+Restored photos will be moved back to their original albums.
+
+### How do I permanently delete photos or empty trash? {#empty-trash}
+
+To free up storage space immediately, you can permanently delete items from trash:
+
+**To empty all trash:**
+- Open Trash
+- Click/tap "Empty trash" or the trash icon
+- Confirm that you want to permanently delete all items
+
+**To delete specific items:**
+- Open Trash
+- Select the items you want to permanently delete
+- Choose "Delete permanently" from the menu
+- Confirm the action
+
+**Warning**: Permanently deleted items cannot be recovered.
+
+### Can I recover files after 30 days in trash? {#recover-after-30-days}
+
+No, files in trash are permanently deleted after 30 days and cannot be recovered. This is an irreversible operation.
+
+If you need to keep certain files, make sure to restore them from trash before the 30-day period expires. We recommend regularly checking your trash if you're unsure about deleting certain items.
+
+### Does trash count against my storage? {#trash-storage}
+
+Yes, items in trash are included in your storage quota calculation. To free up storage space, you can:
+- Manually empty your trash
+- Permanently delete specific items
+- Wait for automatic deletion after 30 days
+
+Once files are permanently deleted (either manually or after 30 days), the storage space will be freed up and reflected in your account.
+
+### What happens when I delete an album? {#delete-album}
+
+When you delete an album in Ente, you'll be given two options:
+
+1. **Delete album and keep photos**: The album is removed, but photos that were exclusively in that album are moved to the [Uncategorized](#uncategorized) section. Photos that exist in other albums remain there.
+
+2. **Delete album and photos**: Both the album and all photos in it are moved to Trash. Photos will be permanently deleted after 30 days unless restored.
+
+### Can I delete photos that are shared with me? {#delete-shared-photos}
+
+You can remove shared photos from your view, but you cannot permanently delete photos that someone else owns. Only the owner of the photo can permanently delete it from Ente.
+
+If someone has shared an album with you and you want to stop seeing it, you can leave the shared album or archive it instead.
+
+### Do deleted photos on my device also delete from Ente? {#device-deletion-sync}
+
+No. If you delete a photo from your device's native photos app, it will **not** be automatically deleted from Ente. This is by design for two reasons:
+
+1. **Safety**: Prevents accidental loss of your backed-up photos
+2. **Platform restrictions**: iOS and Android don't allow apps to automatically delete users' photos without manual confirmation
+
+If you want to delete a photo from Ente, you must do it manually within the Ente app.
+
+### What happens to deleted photos in collaborative albums? {#collaborative-deletion}
+
+In collaborative albums:
+- **If you're a collaborator**: You can only delete photos that you uploaded. When you delete a photo you uploaded, it goes to your trash.
+- **If you're the album owner**: You can remove any photos from the album, but you can only permanently delete photos you own. Other collaborators' photos will be removed from the album but remain in their accounts.
+
+When a collaborator leaves or is removed from a shared album, any photos they uploaded are also removed from that album.
+
+### Can I recover photos after deleting my account? {#recover-after-account-deletion}
+
+No. When you delete your Ente account, all your data (including photos in trash) is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. This is an irreversible operation.
+
+Before deleting your account, make sure to:
+1. [Export your photos](/photos/faq/advanced-features#export) if you want to keep them
+2. Restore any photos from trash that you want to keep
+3. Save any important albums or shared content
+
+### How do I delete multiple photos at once? {#bulk-delete}
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Long press on the first photo to enter selection mode
+- Tap additional photos to select them (or tap "Select all")
+- Tap the trash icon in the action bar
+- Confirm deletion
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Click the first photo
+- Hold Shift and click the last photo to select a range (or Ctrl/Cmd+A for all)
+- Press Delete key or click the trash icon
+- Confirm deletion
+
+All selected photos will be moved to trash together.
+
+### Why can't I delete some photos? {#cannot-delete}
+
+You may not be able to delete photos if:
+- They are owned by someone else who shared them with you
+- You don't have permission (you're a viewer, not a collaborator or owner)
+- There's a sync issue - try refreshing or restarting the app
+
+If you still can't delete photos you own, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io).
+
+### How is Uncategorized different from Trash? {#uncategorized-vs-trash}
+
+**Uncategorized** is for photos that aren't in any regular album but are still active in your library:
+- Photos are fully accessible and searchable
+- They count towards storage
+- They won't be automatically deleted
+- You can add them to albums anytime
+
+**Trash** is for photos you've intentionally deleted:
+- Photos are scheduled for permanent deletion after 30 days
+- They're hidden from normal views (except Trash folder)
+- They count towards storage until permanently deleted
+- You can restore them within 30 days
+
+## iOS Album Backup and Organization {#ios-album-backup}
+
+### Why don't all photos from a new iOS album appear in the corresponding Ente album? {#ios-new-album}
+
+If you create a new album on your device after the initial backup, the photos in that album may have already been uploaded to another album in Ente. To fix this, go to the "On Device" album in Ente, select all photos, and manually add them to the corresponding album in Ente.

+description: Frequently asked questions about backing up and syncing photos in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Backup and Sync
+
+## Mobile Backup
+
+### How does automatic backup work in Ente? {#automatic-backup}
+
+Once you select which albums to backup in your mobile app settings, Ente automatically syncs new photos and videos from those albums to the cloud. Backup happens in the background without needing to open the app.
+
+**Key features:**
+- Background sync runs automatically
+- Original quality with no compression
+- Smart resumption if interrupted
+- WiFi-only by default (configurable)
+
+Learn more in the [Backup feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/).
+
+### How do I select which albums to back up? {#select-albums}
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Backed up folders` and select the albums you want to automatically backup.
+
+Once configured, new photos added to these albums will automatically sync in the background.
+
+### Can I backup over mobile data or only WiFi? {#mobile-data}
+
+By default, Ente only backs up photos over WiFi to save mobile data and battery. However, you can change this setting:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup` and toggle "Backup over mobile data".
+
+Note that backing up over mobile data can consume significant data if you have many photos to upload.
+
+### Why is my initial backup taking so long? {#initial-backup-slow}
+
+The initial backup can take time depending on:
+- The size of your photo library
+- Your internet connection speed
+- Whether you're using WiFi or mobile data
+- Device battery optimization settings
+
+**Tips to speed up initial backup:**
+
+**On iOS:**
+- Keep the app open in foreground for large initial uploads
+- Disable automatic screen lock temporarily (`Settings > Backup > Backup settings > Disable auto lock`)
+- Videos won't backup in background - keep the app open for them
+
+**On Android:**
+- Disable battery optimization for Ente in system settings
+- Keep your device connected to power
+- Ensure you haven't force-closed the app from recents
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Desktop uploads are generally faster than mobile
+- Consider doing initial upload from desktop if you have a large library
+
+### What happens if my backup is interrupted? {#backup-interrupted}
+
+If your backup is interrupted (due to network issues, closing the app, or other reasons), Ente will automatically resume from where it left off the next time you have connectivity. You don't need to restart the entire backup process.
+
+### Do deleted photos on my device also delete from Ente? {#deletion-sync}
+
+No. If you delete a photo from your device's native photos app, it will **not** be automatically deleted from Ente. This is by design for two reasons:
+
+1. **Safety**: Prevents accidental loss of photos
+2. **Platform restrictions**: iOS and Android don't allow apps to automatically delete photos without manual confirmation
+
+If you want to delete a photo from Ente, you must do it manually within the Ente app.
+
+### Understanding Ente's backup vs. sync paradigm {#backup-vs-sync}
+
+**Ente is a backup service, not a two-way sync service like Google Photos.**
+
+**What this means:**
+
+**Changes in Ente → Your device:**
+- ❌ Deleting a photo in Ente does NOT delete it from your device
+- ❌ Moving photos between albums in Ente does NOT affect your device albums
+- ❌ Renaming albums in Ente does NOT rename device albums
+
+**Changes on your device → Ente:**
+- ✅ New photos on your device → automatically backed up to Ente
+- ❌ Deleting photos from your device → does NOT delete from Ente
+- ❌ Moving photos between device albums → may not update Ente albums
+- ❌ Renaming device albums → does NOT rename Ente albums
+
+**Why this design?**
+
+1. **Safety**: Prevents accidental data loss
+2. **Platform limitations**: OS restrictions prevent true two-way sync
+3. **Backup-first philosophy**: Ente preserves your photos even if you accidentally delete them locally
+
+**What you need to know:**
+
+✅ **Uploading**: Happens automatically for selected albums
+✅ **Re-upload protection**: Ente won't re-upload photos you've already uploaded, even if you delete them from Ente and they're still on your device
+❌ **Two-way sync**: Not supported - changes in Ente don't reflect on your device
+
+**If you want to delete a photo everywhere:**
+1. Delete from Ente app
+2. Delete from your device's native Photos app
+3. Both deletions must be done manually
+
+### Can I delete photos from my device after backing up to Ente? {#free-up-space-after-backup}
+
+Yes! Once photos are safely backed up to Ente, you can delete them from your device to free up space.
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Use Ente's "Free up space" feature at `Settings > Backup > Free up space`. Ente will show photos that are backed up and can be safely deleted. Review and confirm deletion.
+
+This feature only deletes photos that have been successfully uploaded to Ente. Photos remain in Ente and can be re-downloaded anytime.
+
+Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+### If I delete a photo from Ente, will it be re-uploaded from my device? {#delete-reupload}
+
+**No, it will not be re-uploaded automatically.**
+
+Ente tracks which files have been uploaded and won't upload them again, even if you delete them from Ente while they're still on your device.
+
+**To force a re-upload of previously uploaded files:**
+
+You would need to use "Reset ignored files" in `Settings > Backup`. However, this is rarely needed and should be done carefully as it will re-upload all previously uploaded files.
+
+### How does Ente handle duplicate files during backup? {#duplicate-handling}
+
+Ente automatically detects and handles duplicate files during upload:
+
+- If you try to upload the same photo multiple times to the same album, Ente will skip it
+- If you upload the same photo to different albums, Ente creates a symlink (reference) instead of uploading it again
+- This saves storage space while maintaining your album structure
+
+This happens automatically in the background without any action required from you.
+
+Learn more in the [Duplicate detection guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).
+
+### What file formats can I backup? {#backup-file-formats}
+
+Ente supports all files with mime types of `image/*` or `video/*`, regardless of their specific format. This includes:
+
+- Common formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4, MOV, etc.
+- Live Photos (both photo and video components)
+- RAW formats (limited support currently)
+
+**Limitations:**
+- Maximum file size: 10 GB
+- Some video formats cannot be streamed on web browsers and must be downloaded
+
+### Does Ente compress my photos during backup? {#does-ente-compress}
+
+No. Ente backs up your photos in **original quality with no compression**. The file size of your photos in Ente will be the same as the original file sizes.
+
+Your photos are encrypted before upload, but encryption doesn't change the quality or apply any compression.
+
+### How can I check my backup status? {#check-backup-status}
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Backup status` to see:
+- Number of files backed up
+- Files pending upload
+- Any errors or issues
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Check the sync status indicator in the bottom right corner
+- Click to expand and see detailed progress
+
+### Does Ente backup Live Photos from iPhone? {#live-photos-backup}
+
+Yes! Ente backs up both components of Live Photos:
+- The photo component
+- The video component
+
+Both are preserved in their original quality.
+
+## Background Sync
+
+### How does background sync work? {#how-background-sync-works}
+
+Background sync allows Ente to automatically back up your photos without needing to keep the app open. Once you've selected which albums to back up, Ente will monitor those albums and upload new photos in the background.
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Works on both iOS and Android
+- Backs up photos over WiFi by default (configurable in settings)
+- Continues even when the app is closed
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Use [watch folders](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#what-are-watch-folders) to automatically sync specific directories
+
+**Important**: On iOS, large videos may not upload in background - they'll sync when you open the app.
+
+Learn more in the [Background sync feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/#background-sync).
+
+### Why isn't background sync working on my phone? {#background-sync-not-working}
+
+If photos aren't automatically backing up in the background, try these solutions:
+
+**On Android:**
+1. Open device `Settings > Apps > Ente > Battery`
+2. Choose "Unrestricted" or disable "Optimize battery usage"
+3. Grant all required permissions (Photos, Storage)
+4. Ensure you haven't force-closed the app from recents
+
+**On iOS:**
+1. Open device `Settings > Ente`
+2. Enable "Background App Refresh"
+3. Grant "Full Access" to Photos
+4. Don't force-quit the Ente app from the app switcher
+5. For initial large backups, keep the app open in foreground
+
+**Note**: On iOS, videos may not upload in the background due to size - they'll sync when you next open the app.
+
+Learn more in the [Background sync guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/#background-sync).
+
+### Does background sync work on web? {#background-sync-web}
+
+No, background sync is not available when using Ente Photos through a web browser. Web browsers don't allow background processes to run when the tab is closed or inactive.
+
+Background sync is only available on:
+- Mobile apps (iOS and Android)
+- Desktop app (via watch folders)
+
+If you're using the web version, you'll need to keep the browser tab open for uploads to complete.
+
+### How does background sync work on iOS? {#ios-background-sync}
+
+On iOS, background sync works through silent push notifications:
+- Our servers "tickle" your device periodically
+- This wakes up the app and gives it 30 seconds to sync
+- Videos may not upload in background due to size limitations
+
+**Important**: If you force-kill the app from recents, iOS won't deliver push notifications and background sync will stop working.
+
+For large initial backups, keep the app open in foreground on iOS.
+
+### How does background sync work on Android? {#android-background-sync}
+
+On Android, the app can run background processes more freely than iOS. However, battery optimization settings can interfere.
+
+**Make sure to**:
+- Disable "Optimize battery usage" for Ente
+- Grant all required permissions
+- Don't force-close the app from recents
+
+**Note**: On Android 15+, if the app is in private space and private space is locked, background sync won't work.
+
+## Desktop Backup (Watch Folders)
+
+### How do watch folders work? {#how-watch-folders-work}
+
+Watch folders allow the Ente desktop app to automatically monitor specific directories on your computer and sync any changes to Ente. When you add or modify files in a watched folder, they're automatically uploaded.
+
+**Key features:**
+- One-way sync from your computer to Ente
+- Monitors folders in real-time
+- Automatically uploads new files
+- Moves files to uncategorized if deleted locally
+- Preserves folder structure as albums
+
+Learn more in the [Watch folders feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders).
+
+### What are watch folders? {#what-are-watch-folders}
+
+Watch folders is a desktop app feature that automatically syncs specific folders on your computer to Ente. Once you add a folder to watch, the app will:
+- Immediately upload all existing files in that folder
+- Continuously monitor the folder for changes
+- Automatically upload any new files added to the folder
+- Move files to Uncategorized if you delete them locally
+
+This creates a one-way background sync from your computer to Ente, automating your photo backup workflow.
+
+### How do I set up watch folders? {#set-up-watch-folders}
+
+1. Open the Ente desktop app
+2. Click "Watch folders" in the sidebar
+3. Click "Add folder" and select the folder you want to watch (or drag and drop it)
+4. If the folder has nested subfolders, choose between:
+   - **Single album**: All files go into one Ente album
+   - **Separate albums**: Each subfolder becomes its own album
+5. The folder will be initially synced and then monitored for changes
+
+The sync happens in the background even when the app is minimized. You can see progress in the bottom right corner.
+
+### Can I watch multiple folders at once? {#watch-multiple-folders}
+
+Yes! You can add as many watch folders as you need. Each folder can be configured independently:
+- Different folders can sync to different albums
+- Each can have its own single/separate album setting
+- All watched folders sync simultaneously in the background
+
+To manage your watch folders, click "Watch folders" in the sidebar to see the list of all folders being watched.
+
+### What happens if I delete a file from my watched folder? {#delete-from-watched-folder}
+
+If you delete a file from a watched folder on your computer, the corresponding file in Ente will be automatically moved to the [Uncategorized](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#uncategorized) album. It won't be permanently deleted - you can still access it from the Uncategorized section.
+
+If you want to remove it completely from Ente, you'll need to manually delete it from the Uncategorized album.
+
+### Why are my watch folders not syncing? {#watch-folders-not-syncing}
+
+Common issues and solutions:
+
+1. **Desktop app is closed**: Watch folders only sync when the desktop app is running. Enable "Launch at startup" in preferences.
+
+2. **Network issues**: Check your internet connection. The sync will automatically resume when connectivity is restored.
+
+3. **Upload in progress**: If you're manually uploading files, watch folder syncing pauses and resumes when the upload completes.
+
+4. **File format not supported**: Check if the files are valid image/video formats. The app may skip unsupported files.
+
+5. **Storage quota exceeded**: Verify you haven't reached your storage limit in Settings.
+
+Check the sync status indicator in the bottom right corner for error details.
+
+### Can I watch folders on a network drive (NAS)? {#watch-nas}
+
+**Not recommended**. The Ente desktop app currently does not officially support NAS (network drives).
+
+While the app may work with network drives in some cases, we've found that network storage products often have:
+- Flaky file system emulation
+- Bad performance during uploads
+- Unreliable file change event notifications (critical for watch folders)
+
+**We strongly recommend** temporarily copying files to your local storage for uploads, rather than watching folders that live on a network drive.
+
+**Exception**: Exports to network drives generally work better than imports. See [Advanced Features](/photos/faq/advanced-features) for export details.
+
+### How do I stop watching a folder? {#stop-watching-folder}
+
+1. Click "Watch folders" in the sidebar
+2. Find the folder you want to stop watching
+3. Click the three dots next to that folder entry
+4. Select "Stop watching"
+
+The folder will no longer be monitored, but all files that were already uploaded to Ente will remain there. Stopping watch does not delete any photos from Ente.
+
+### Can watch folders preserve my nested folder structure? {#watch-nested-structure}
+
+Yes! When you add a folder with nested subfolders, you'll see two options:
+
+**Separate albums mode**:
+- Creates a separate Ente album for each nested folder
+- Only the leaf folder name is used (e.g., both `Photos/2024/Summer` and `Backup/Summer` go to an album called "Summer")
+- Empty folders or folders containing only other folders are ignored
+- Albums cannot be nested in Ente (they'll all appear as top-level albums)
+
+**Single album mode**:
+- All files from all nested folders go into one Ente album
+- The folder structure is flattened
+- Good for when you don't need to preserve organization
+
+Learn more about [Preserving folder structure](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/albums#preserving-folder-structure).
+
+### Does watch folder syncing pause when I close the desktop app? {#watch-folder-requires-app}
+
+Yes. Watch folders only sync when the Ente desktop app is running. To ensure continuous automatic backup:
+
+1. Keep the desktop app running (it can be minimized)
+2. Enable "Launch at startup" in Preferences so the app starts automatically when you boot your computer
+3. The app will sync in the background without interrupting your work
+
+### Can I change watch folder settings after setting it up? {#change-watch-settings}
+
+Currently, you cannot directly change the album configuration (single vs separate) for an existing watch folder. However, you can:
+
+1. Stop watching the folder
+2. Remove the folder from the watch list
+3. Re-add it with the desired settings
+
+Ente will detect already-uploaded files and skip them, so you won't end up with duplicates.
+
+### How does watch folders handle duplicates? {#watch-folder-dedup}
+
+Watch folders use the same automatic duplicate detection as regular uploads:
+- If a file already exists in the target album, it will be skipped
+- If uploading to a different album, a symlink (reference) is created instead of re-uploading
+- This saves storage space and upload time
+
+You can safely add the same folder multiple times or re-add folders after stopping watch - duplicates will be automatically handled.
+
+Learn more in the [Duplicate detection guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).
+
+### Can I watch a folder and manually upload to it at the same time? {#watch-and-manual-upload}
+
+If you start a manual upload while watch folder sync is in progress, the watch folder sync will pause and resume automatically when your manual upload completes.
+
+This ensures smooth operation and prevents conflicts.
+
+## General Backup Questions
+
+### Can I backup photos from my computer? {#backup-from-computer}
+
+Yes! On desktop, you have two options:
+
+1. **Watch folders**: Automatically sync specific folders (recommended for ongoing backup)
+   - Continuous monitoring and automatic uploads
+   - See watch folders section above
+
+2. **Manual upload**: Drag and drop files or folders into the Ente desktop app
+   - Good for one-time uploads
+   - Can upload ZIP files
+   - Preserves folder structure
+
+### Can I pause and resume backups? {#pause-resume-backup}
+
+**On mobile:**
+You can effectively pause backups by:
+- Turning off WiFi/mobile data
+- Going to `Settings > Backup` and toggling off specific albums
+
+To resume, simply turn connectivity back on or re-enable the albums.
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Watch folder syncing will pause if you close the app
+- You can remove watch folders temporarily and re-add them later
+- Uploads can be paused by closing the desktop app
+
+### Why are some photos not uploading? {#photos-not-uploading}
+
+Common reasons and solutions:
+
+1. **Storage quota exceeded**: Check your storage in Settings and upgrade if needed
+2. **Network issues**: Verify internet connectivity
+3. **Battery optimization** (Android): Disable for Ente in system settings
+4. **Background App Refresh** (iOS): Enable in device Settings > Ente
+5. **File format not supported**: Check if the file meets Ente's requirements
+6. **File too large**: Maximum file size is 10 GB
+
+For detailed troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](/photos/faq/troubleshooting).
+
+### Can I use the desktop app and mobile app at the same time? {#use-multiple-devices}
+
+Yes! You can use Ente on as many devices as you want simultaneously. All your devices will stay in sync:
+- Photos uploaded from any device appear on all devices
+- Albums, edits, and organization sync across devices
+- Each device can have its own backup/watch folder settings
+
+The sync happens automatically in the background when devices are connected to the internet.
+
+## File Support & Upload Limits
+
+### What file formats does Ente support? {#file-formats}
+
+Ente supports all files that have a mime type of `image/*` or `video/*` regardless of their specific format.
+
+However, we only have limited support for RAW currently. We are working towards adding full support, and you can watch this [thread](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/625) for updates.
+
+If you find an issue with ente's ability to parse a certain file type, please write to [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) with details of the unsupported file format and we will do our best to help you out.
+
+### Is there a file size limit? {#file-size-limit}
+
+Yes, we currently do not support files larger than 10 GB.
+
+### Does Ente support videos? {#video-support}
+
+Ente supports backing up and downloading of videos in their original format and quality.
+
+But some of these formats cannot be streamed on the web browser and you will be prompted to download them.
+
+### Does Ente apply compression to uploaded photos? {#compression}
+
+Ente does not apply compression to uploaded photos. The file size of your photos in Ente will be similar to the original file sizes you have.
+
+## Deduplication
+
+### How does the deduplication feature work on the desktop app? {#deduplication-desktop}
+
+If the app finds exact duplicates, it will show them in the manual deduplication tool. When you confirm removal, the app keeps one copy and creates symlinks for the duplicates in all albums. This helps save storage space while maintaining your album structure.
+
+Learn more about [manually removing duplicates](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization) and [automatic duplicate detection during backup](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).

-### App updates
+The content from **Desktop FAQ** has been reorganized. You can find it in the following locations:
 
-**How do I ensure that the Ente desktop app stays up to date on my system?**
+## Desktop Installation
+- [Install desktop app](/photos/faq/account-creation#install-desktop) - Download and installation
+- [Desktop installation guide](/photos/getting-started/installation) - Complete installation walkthrough
 
-Ente desktop includes an auto-update feature, ensuring that whenever updates are
-deployed, the app will automatically download and install them. You don't need
-to manually update the software.
+## Desktop Troubleshooting
+- [Desktop app crashes during large uploads](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#desktop-large-uploads) - Multi-TB library upload issues and workarounds

+- [Export from desktop](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export) - Exporting your library
 
-**How do I identify which files experienced upload issues within the desktop
-app?**
-
-Check the sections within the upload progress bar for "Failed Uploads," "Ignored
-Uploads," and "Unsuccessful Uploads."
-
-### Icon update
-
-**I updated my Linux app, but it is still showing the old icon**
-
-You might need to update the icon cache of your Linux desktop environment.
-
-The easiest way to fix this would be to restart your computer (or logout and
-login again into your desktop environment). It should also be possible to do
-this without restarting, but the steps for refreshing the icon cache would then
-be specific to your distro (e.g. `xdg-desktop-menu forceupdate`).

-# Export
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-## How can I backup my data in a local drive outside Ente?
+The content from **Export FAQ** has been reorganized. You can find it in the following locations:
 
-You can use our CLI tool or our desktop app to set up exports of your data to
-your local drive. This way, you can use Ente in your day to day use, with an
-additional guarantee that a copy of your original photos and videos are always
-available on your machine.
+## Exporting Your Data
+- [Export feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export) - Complete guide to exporting your entire library
+- [Does exported data preserve metadata?](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing) - Metadata preservation during export
+- [Export options and formats](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync) - How to configure exports
 
-- You can use [Ente's CLI](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#export)
-  to export your data in a cron job to a location of your choice. The exports
-  are incremental, and will also gracefully handle interruptions.
+## Migration and Export
+- [Exporting for migration](/photos/migration/export/) - Exporting when leaving Ente
+- [Export to NAS](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#nas) - Network drive export considerations
 
-- Similarly, you can use Ente's [desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop)
-  to export your data to a folder of your choice. The desktop app also supports
-  "continuous" exports, where it will automatically export new items in the
-  background without you needing to run any other cron jobs. See
-  [migration/export](/photos/migration/export/) for more details.
-
-## Does the exported data preserve album structure?
-
-Yes. When you export your data for local backup, it will maintain the exact
-album structure how you have set up within Ente.
-
-## Does the exported data preserve metadata?
-
-Yes, the metadata is written out to a separate JSON file during export. Note
-that the original is not modified. For more details, see the
-[description of the exported metadata](/photos/faq/metadata#export).
-
-## Can I do a 2-way sync?
-
-A two way sync is not currently supported. Attempting to export data to the same
-folder that is also being watched by the Ente app will result in undefined
-behaviour (e.g. duplicate files, export stalling etc).
-
-## Why is my export size larger than my backed-up size in Ente?
+---
 
-One possible reason could be that you have files that are in multiple different
-albums. Whenever a file is backed-up to Ente in multiple albums it will still
-count only once towards the total storage in Ente. However, during export that
-file will be downloaded multiple times to the different folders corresponding to
-said albums, causing the total export size to be larger.

-# Face recognition
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-## Can I merge or de-merge persons recognized by the app?
+The content from **Face Recognition FAQ** has been reorganized. You can find it in the following locations:
 
-Yes! The general mechanism for doing this is to assign the same name to both
-persons.
+## Face Recognition

+- [How do I enable face recognition?](/photos/faq/search-and-discovery#enable-face-recognition) - Setup instructions for mobile and desktop

+- [Machine learning overview](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning) - How on-device ML works
+- [ML privacy](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#ml-privacy) - Privacy guarantees for face data
+- [Why is ML slow?](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#ml-slow) - Indexing performance tips
 
-First, make sure one of the two person groupings is assigned a name through the
-`Add a name` banner. Then for the second grouping, use the same banner but now
-instead of typing the name again, tap on the already given name that should now
-be listed.
+## Troubleshooting
+- [App crashes with ML enabled](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#app-crashes-ml-video) - Memory issues on mobile
+- [ML indexing taking long](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#ml-slow) - Speed optimization tips
 
-De-merging a certain grouping can be done by going to the person, pressing
-`Review suggestions` and then the top right `History icon`. Now press on the
-`minus icon` beside the group you want to de-merge.
-
-### Desktop
-
-Similarly, on desktop you can use the "Add a name" button to merge people by
-selecting an existing person, and use the "Review suggestions" sheet to de-merge
-previously merged persons (click the top right history icon on the suggestion
-sheet to see the previous merges, and if necessary, undo them).
-
-## How can I remove an incorrectly grouped face from a person?
-
-On our mobile app, open up the person from the People section, click on the
-three dots to open up overflow menu, and click on Edit. Now you will be
-presented with the list of all photos that were merged to create this person.
-
-You can click on the merged photos and select the photos you think are
-incorrectly grouped (by long-pressing on them) and select "Remove" from the
-action bar that pops up to remove any incorrect faces.
-
-## How do I change the cover for a recognized person?
-
-### Mobile
-
-Inside the person group, long-press the image you want to use as cover. Then
-press `Use as cover`.
-
-### Desktop
-
-Desktop currently does not support picking a cover. It will default to the most
-recent image.
-
-## Can I tell the app to ignore certain recognized person?
-
-Yes! You can tell the app not to show certain persons.
-
-### Mobile
-
-First, make sure the person is not named. If you already gave a name, then first
-press `Remove person label` in the top right menu. Now inside the unnamed
-grouping, press `Ignore person` from the top right menu.
-
-To undo this action, go to a **photo containing the person**. Go to the **file
-info** section of the photo and press on the **face thumbnail of the ignored
-person**. This will take you to the grouping of this person. Here you can press
-`Show person` to undo ignoring the person.
-
-### Desktop
-
-Similarly, on desktop, you use the "Ignore" option from the top right menu to
-ignore a particular face group (If you already give them a name, "Reset person"
-first). And to undo this action, open that person (via the file info of a photo
-containing that person), and select "Show person".
-
-## How well does the app handle photos of babies?
-
-The face recognition model we use (or any face recognition model for that
-matter) is known to struggle with pictures of babies and toddlers. While we
-can't prevent all cases where this goes wrong, we've added a option to help you
-correct the model in such cases.
-
-If you find a mixed grouping of several different babies, you can use the
-`mixed grouping` option in the top right menu of said grouping. Activating this
-option will make the model re-evaluate the grouping with stricter settings,
-hopefully separating the different babies in different new groupings.
+---
 
-Please note this functionality is currently only available on mobile.

-Yes, we currently do not support files larger than 10 GB.
-
-## Does Ente support videos?
-
-Ente supports backing up and downloading of videos in their original format and
-quality.
-
-But some of these formats cannot be streamed on the web browser and you will be
-prompted to download them.
-
-## Why does Ente consume lesser storage than other providers?
-
-Most storage providers compute your storage quota in GigaBytes (GBs) by dividing
-your total bytes uploaded by `1000 x 1000 x 1000`.
-
-Ente on the other hand, computes your storage quota in GibiBytes (GiBs) by
-dividing your total bytes uploaded by `1024 x 1024 x 1024`.
-
-We decided to leave out the **i** from **GiBs** to reduce noise on our
-interfaces.
-
-## Why should I trust Ente for long-term data-storage?
-
-Unlike large companies, we have a focused mission, to build a safe space where
-you can easily archive your personal memories.
-
-This is the only thing we want to do, and with our pricing model, we can
-profitably do it.
-
-We preserve your data end-to-end encrypted, and our open source apps have been
-[externally audited](https://ente.io/blog/cryptography-audit/).
-
-Also, we have spent great deal of engineering effort into designing reliable
-data replication and graceful disaster recovery plans. This is also done
-transparently - we have documented the specifics of our replication and
-reliability [here](https://ente.io/reliability).
-
-In short, we love what we do, we have no reasons to be distracted, and we are as
-reliable as any one can be.
-
-If you would like to fund the development of this project, please consider
-[subscribing](https://ente.io/download).
-
-## How do I pronounce Ente?
-
-It's like cafe 😊. kaf-_ay_. en-_tay_.
-
-## Does Ente apply compression to uploaded photos?
-
-Ente does not apply compression to uploaded photos. The file size of your photos
-in Ente will be similar to the original file sizes you have.
-
-## Can I add photos from a shared album to albums that I created in Ente?
-
-On Ente's mobile apps, you can add photos from an album that's shared with you,
-into one of your own albums. This will create a copy of the item that you fully
-own, and will count against your storage quota.
-
-## Can I sync a folder containing multiple subfolders, each representing an album?
-
-Yes, when you drag and drop the folder onto the desktop app, the app will detect
-the multiple folders and prompt you to choose whether you want to create a
-single album or separate albums for each folder.
-
-## How do I keep NAS and Ente photos synced?
-
-Please try using our CLI to pull data into your NAS
-https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme.
-
-## Is there a way to view all albums on the map view?
-
-Currently, the Ente mobile app allows you to see a map view of all the albums by
-clicking on "Your map" under "Locations" on the search screen.
-
-## How to reset my password if I lost it?
-
-On the login page, enter your email and click on Forgot Password. Then, enter
-your recovery key and create a new password.
-
-## Can I search for photos using the descriptions I’ve added?
-
-Yes, descriptions are searchable, making it easier to find specific photos
-later. To do this, open the photo, tap the (i) button, and enter your
-description.
-
-## How does the deduplication feature work on the desktop app?
-
-If the app finds exact duplicates, it will show them in the deduplication. When
-you delete a duplicate, the app keeps one copy and creates a symlink for the
-other duplicate. This helps save storage space.
-
-## What happens if I lose access to my email address? Can I use my recovery key to bypass email verification?
-
-No, the recovery key does not bypass email verification. For security reasons,
-we do not disable or bypass email verification unless the account owner reaches
-out to us and successfully verifies their identity by providing details about
-their account.
-
-If you lose access to your email, please contact our support team at
-support@ente.io

-# iOS Album Backup and Organization in Ente
-
-## How does Ente handle photos that are part of multiple iOS albums?
-
-When you select multiple albums for backup, Ente prioritizes uploading each
-photo to the album with the fewest photos. This means a photo will only be
-uploaded once, even if it exists in multiple albums on your device. If you
-create new albums on your device after the initial backup, those photos may not
-appear in the corresponding Ente album if they were already uploaded to a
-different album.
-
-## Why don’t all photos from a new iOS album appear in the corresponding Ente album?
-
-If you create a new album on your device after the initial backup, the photos in
-that album may have already been uploaded to another album in Ente. To fix this,
-go to the "On Device" album in Ente, select all photos, and manually add them to
-the corresponding album in Ente.
-
-## What happens if I reorganize my photos in the iOS Photos app after backing up?
-
-Reorganizing photos in the iOS Photos app (e.g., moving photos to new albums)
-won’t automatically reflect in Ente. You’ll need to manually add those photos to
-the corresponding albums in Ente to maintain consistency.

-description: Two related ways of hiding or archiving in Ente Photos
+title: This Page Has Moved
+description: This content has been reorganized
 ---
 
-# Can I hide photos in ente?
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-Yes, you can hide specific photos and videos in Ente using the "Hide" action.
-Open the photo, expand the overflow menu and select Hide (the action with the
-eye icon).
+The content from **Hide vs Archive** has been reorganized. You can find it in the following locations:
 
-Hidden items do not appear anywhere in Ente except within the special "Hidden"
-category. Ente will ask for the device biometric (FaceID / TouchID) or passcode
-to view the contents of the Hidden category.
+## Hidden Photos
+- [Hidden photos feature guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/hide) - Complete guide to hiding photos with biometric protection
+- [Can I hide shared photos?](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#hide-shared) - Hiding photos shared with you
 
-You can reach the Hidden category from the bottom of the albums screen.
+## Archive
+- [Archive feature guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/archive) - Complete guide to archiving photos
+- [Do archived photos appear in search?](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#archive-search) - Archive visibility
 
-Keep in mind that hidden items will still show up in the "On device" albums
-within Ente as long as they are present in your native gallery. But once you
-remove them from your device, they'll stop showing up here.
+## Understanding the Difference
+- [Hide vs Archive - what's the difference?](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#difference) - Key differences explained
 
-For more details, see [features/hide](/photos/features/hide).
-
-### Archive
-
-There is also a related feature called "Archive". While hidden items do not
-appear anywhere, archived items do not appear in your timeline but can otherwise
-be seen within the album and search results.
-
-This is useful when you're not trying to hide certain photos per se, but just do
-not want some of them (say, some old screenshots) to clutter your home timeline.

+title: Metadata and Editing FAQ
+description: Frequently asked questions about photo metadata, EXIF data, and editing in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Metadata and Editing
+
+## Viewing Metadata
+
+### What metadata does Ente preserve during import? {#metadata-preserved}
+
+Ente reads and preserves:
+- **EXIF data**: Camera settings, date taken, GPS coordinates
+- **XMP and IPTC**: Additional metadata standards
+- **Google Takeout JSON**: If importing from Google Photos
+- **Filename-based dates**: For files without EXIF (like screenshots)
+
+All this metadata is:
+- Encrypted before upload
+- Searchable within Ente
+- Preserved when you export
+
+### How does Ente handle Exif data and descriptions? {#exif-handling}
+
+Ente will try to read as much information from Exif metadata when the image is uploaded, but after that, only the fields which have been parsed into Ente can be searched.
+
+The app still shows all the fields in the raw Exif data in the file info panel when someone taps on the "View all Exif" option, but otherwise the app is unaware of these fields.
+
+In particular, for the description associated with a photo, the exact logic to determine the description from the Exif when uploading the image can be seen [in this part of the code](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/0dcb185744da469848b41b668fe4b647226b6fe2/web/packages/gallery/services/exif.ts#L609-L620).
+
+### Where does Ente import photo dates from? {#photo-date-sources}
+
+Ente will import the date for your photos from three places (in order of priority):
+
+1. **EXIF data**: Normally, Ente tries to read the date from the Exif and other metadata (e.g. XMP, IPTC) embedded in the file.
+
+2. **Metadata JSON** (Google Takeout): In case of photos exported from Google Photos, the metadata is not embedded within the file itself, but is instead present in a separate sidecar ".json" file. Ente knows how to read these files.
+
+3. **File name**: If the photo does not have a date in the Exif data (and it is not a Google takeout), for example, for screenshots or WhatsApp forwards, Ente will try and deduce the correct date for the file from the name of the file.
+
+> **Note**: The filename-based detection works great most of the time, but it is inherently based on heuristics and is not exact.
+
+If we are unable to decipher the creation time from these 3 sources, we will set the upload time as the photo's creation time.
+
+### How do I view EXIF data for a photo? {#view-exif}
+
+**On mobile and web:**
+1. Open the photo
+2. Tap/click the info button (i)
+3. Scroll down to see basic metadata
+4. Tap "View all Exif data" to see complete EXIF information
+
+This shows all the technical data about the photo including camera settings, lens information, and more.
+
+## Importing from Google Photos
+
+### How does Ente handle Google Takeout metadata? {#google-takeout-metadata}
+
+When you export your data using Google Takeout, Google provides both your photos and their associated metadata JSON files. However, Google sometimes splits the JSON and photo across different zip files.
+
+For example, `flower.jpeg` might be in one zip and `flower.json` in another. This prevents Ente from correctly mapping them.
+
+**Best practice**: We [recommend](/photos/migration/from-google-photos/) unzipping all of your Google Takeout zips into a single folder, then importing that folder into Ente. This way, we can always correctly map photos and their metadata.
+
+### Why are my Google Photos dates wrong after import? {#google-photos-dates-wrong}
+
+If the dates appear incorrect after importing from Google Takeout, it's usually because:
+- The photo's Exif data has a different date than Google's metadata JSON
+- The JSON file wasn't matched with the photo during import
+
+To fix this:
+1. Make sure you unzipped all Google Takeout zips into one folder
+2. Import that single folder (not individual zips)
+3. This ensures Ente can match JSON files with their photos
+
+## Editing Metadata
+
+### How do I add descriptions or captions to photos? {#add-descriptions}
+
+You can add descriptions (captions) to your photos in Ente:
+
+**On mobile and web:**
+1. Open the photo
+2. Tap/click the info button (i)
+3. Tap/click "Add description" or the description field
+4. Type your description
+5. Save
+
+**Searchability**: Descriptions are searchable! You can find photos later by searching for words in their descriptions.
+
+**Privacy**: Like all your data in Ente, descriptions are stored end-to-end encrypted.
+
+### Can I bulk edit photo dates? {#bulk-edit-dates}
+
+Yes! You can bulk-edit creation time of photos from the desktop app:
+
+1. Multi-select the photos you want to edit (Ctrl/Cmd+click or Shift+click)
+2. Select the "Fix time" option from the action bar
+3. Choose the correct date/time
+4. Apply to all selected photos
+
+This is useful for:
+- Fixing photos with incorrect timestamps
+- Adjusting timezone differences
+- Correcting dates on scanned photos
+
+**Note**: This feature is currently only available on the desktop app.
+
+### Can I bulk edit photo locations? {#bulk-edit-locations}
+
+Yes! You can bulk-edit location coordinates from the mobile app:
+
+1. Long press to multi-select the photos you want to edit
+2. Select "Edit location" from the action bar
+3. Choose the correct location on the map
+4. Apply to all selected photos
+
+This is useful for:
+- Adding location to photos without GPS data
+- Correcting wrong GPS coordinates
+- Organizing photos by location after the fact
+
+**Note**: This feature is currently only available on the mobile app.
+
+### How do I fix incorrect photo dates? {#fix-incorrect-dates}
+
+Photos sometimes have incorrect dates due to:
+- Camera settings being wrong
+- Timezone issues
+- Scanned photos without proper metadata
+
+**To fix dates:**
+1. Use the bulk date editing feature (see above)
+2. Select photos with incorrect dates
+3. Apply the correct date/time
+
+Ente will store your corrections and sync them across all your devices.
+
+### Are my metadata edits reversible? {#edits-reversible}
+
+Yes! When you edit metadata (dates, locations, descriptions) in Ente, the **original file is never modified**. Your edits are stored separately.
+
+When you export your photos:
+- You get the exact original file
+- Edits are saved in a separate JSON file (same format as Google Takeout)
+- This preserves both the original and your modifications
+
+This means:
+- You can always access the original metadata
+- Your edits are preserved when exporting
+- Your original files remain untouched
+
+### How do I edit photo filenames? {#edit-filenames}
+
+You can rename photos in Ente:
+
+**On mobile and web:**
+1. Open the photo
+2. Tap/click the info button (i)
+3. Tap/click on the filename
+4. Enter the new name
+5. Save
+
+The original filename is preserved, and your edit is stored separately (similar to other metadata edits).
+
+### Can I add location data to photos that don't have it? {#add-location}
+
+Yes! You can manually add location data to any photo:
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Select the photo(s)
+2. Choose "Edit location" from the menu
+3. Select the location on the map
+4. Save
+
+This adds GPS coordinates to the photo's metadata, allowing you to:
+- View them on the map
+- Search by location
+- Organize photos by where they were taken
+
+See [Bulk edit photo locations](#can-i-bulk-edit-photo-locations) for editing multiple photos at once.
+
+## Exporting Metadata
+
+### Does the exported data preserve metadata? {#export-data-preserve-metadata}
+
+Yes, the metadata is written out to a separate JSON file during export. Note that the original is not modified.
+
+When you export your library, suppose you have `flower.png`. You will end up with:
+
+```
+flower.png
+metadata/flower.png.json
+```
+
+Ente writes this JSON in the same format as Google Takeout so that if a tool supports Google Takeout import, it should be able to read the JSON written by Ente too.
+
+> One small difference: to avoid clutter, Ente puts the JSON in the `metadata/` subfolder, while Google puts it next to the file. Ente itself will read it from either place.
+
+Here is a sample of how the JSON looks:
+
+```json
+{
+    "description": "This will be imported as the caption",
+    "creationTime": {
+        "timestamp": "1613532136",
+        "formatted": "17 Feb 2021, 03:22:16 UTC"
+    },
+    "modificationTime": {
+        "timestamp": "1640225957",
+        "formatted": "23 Dec 2021, 02:19:17 UTC"
+    },
+    "geoData": {
+        "latitude": 12.004170700000001,
+        "longitude": 79.8013945
+    }
+}
+```
+
+`photoTakenTime` will be considered as an alias for `creationTime`, and `geoDataExif` will be considered as a fallback for `geoData`.
+
+### What happens to file creation time during export? {#file-creation-time}
+
+The photo's data will be preserved verbatim, however when it is written out to disk on a new machine a new file gets created. This file will not have the same file system creation time as the file that was uploaded.
+
+There are two reasons for this:
+
+1. **"Creation time" is not universal**: For example, Linux does not support it. From the man page of [fstat](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstat), we can see that this information is just not recorded by the file system on Linux.
+
+2. **Cannot be set from browsers or mobile apps**: There isn't a way to set it even on Windows and macOS for files downloaded from the browser, or for files saved from the mobile apps.
+
+We have considered modifying our desktop and CLI clients to write back the photo's creation time into the creation time of the filesystem file during export. But it is not clear if this would be less or more confusing due to inconsistencies across platforms.
+
+Ente is a photos app, not a file system backup app. Customers for whom the creation time of the file on disk is paramount might be better served by file backup apps.
+
+### Can I modify the original files during export? {#modify-originals}
+
+No. Ente guarantees that you will get back the _exact_ same original photos and videos that you imported. The modifications (e.g. date changes) you make within Ente will be written into a separate metadata JSON file during export so as to not modify the original.
+
+This ensures:
+- You always have access to originals
+- Your edits are preserved separately
+- You can use the metadata JSON with other tools
+
+## Platform-Specific Behavior
+
+### Do metadata edits sync across devices? {#edits-sync}
+
+Yes! All metadata edits (dates, locations, descriptions, filenames) are synced across all your devices using end-to-end encryption.
+
+When you edit metadata on one device:
+- Changes appear on all other devices
+- The original file remains unchanged everywhere
+- Edits are preserved when exporting from any device
+
+### Can I edit metadata on all platforms? {#platform-support}
+
+**Available on mobile and desktop:**
+- Adding descriptions
+- Editing filenames
+- Viewing all EXIF data
+
+**Desktop only:**
+- Bulk editing dates ("Fix time" feature)
+
+**Mobile only:**
+- Bulk editing locations
+
+We're working on bringing all editing features to all platforms.
+
+### Does Ente modify any file metadata? {#modify-file-metadata}
+
+No. Ente never modifies your original files or their embedded metadata. All edits you make are stored separately in Ente's database and:
+- Synced encrypted across your devices
+- Written to separate JSON files during export
+- Kept separate from the original file
+
+Your original photos with their original metadata remain untouched.

+- [How do I view EXIF data for a photo?](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing) - Accessing all embedded metadata
 
-### Exif
-
-Normally, Ente app tries to read the date of the photo from the Exif and other
-metadata (e.g. XMP, IPTC) embedded in the file.
-
-> [!TIP]
->
-> You can see all of the Exif metadata embedded within a photo by using the
-> "View all Exif data" option in the info panel for the photo in Ente.
-
-### Importing from Google takeout
-
-In case of photos exported from Google Photos, the metadata is not embedded
-within the file itself, but is instead present in a separate sidecar ".json"
-file. Ente knows how to read these files, and in such cases can pick up the
-metadata from them.
-
-When you export your data using a Google takeout, Google provides you both your
-photos and their associated metadata JSON files. However, for incomprehensible
-reasons, they split the JSON and photo across zip files. That is, in some cases
-if you have a file named `flower.jpeg`, which has an associated metadata JSON
-file named `flower.json`, Google will put the `.jpeg` and the `.json` in
-separate takeout zips, and Ente will be unable to correlate them.
-
-To avoid such issues, **we [recommend](/photos/migration/from-google-photos/)
-unzipping all of your Google takeout zips into a single folder, and then
-importing that folder into Ente**. This way, we will be able to always correctly
-map, for example, `flower.jpeg` and `flower.json` and show the same date for
-`flower.jpeg` that you would've seen within Google Photos.
-
-### File name
-
-In case the photo does not have a date in the Exif data (and it is not a Google
-takeout), for example, for screenshots or Whatsapp forwards, Ente will still try
-and deduce the correct date for the file from the name of the file.
-
-> [!NOTE]
->
-> This process works great most of the time, but it is inherently based on
-> heuristics and is not exact.
-
-If we are unable to decipher the creation time from these 3 sources, we will set
-the upload time as the photo's creation time.
-
-## Modifications
-
-Ente supports modifications to the following metadata:
-
-- File name
-- Date & time
-- Location
-
-The first two options are available on both mobile and desktop, while the
-ability to update location is only available within our mobile apps.
-
-### Bulk modifications
-
-You can bulk-edit creation time of photos from our desktop app, by
-multi-selecting items and selecting the "Fix time" option from the action bar.
-
-You can bulk-edit location coordinates of photos from our mobile app, by
-multi-selecting items and selecting the "Edit location" option from the action
-bar.
-
-## Export
-
-Ente guarantees that you will get back the _exact_ same original photos and
-videos that you imported. The modifications (e.g. date changes) you make within
-Ente will be written into a separate metadata JSON file during export so as to
-not modify the original.
-
-As an example: suppose you have `flower.png`. When you export your library, you
-will end up with:
-
-```
-flower.png
-metadata/flower.png.json
-```
-
-Ente writes this JSON in the same format as Google Takeout so that if a tool
-supports Google Takeout import, it should be able to read the JSON written by
-Ente too.
-
-> One small difference is that, to avoid clutter, Ente puts the JSON in the
-> `metadata/` subfolder, while Google puts it next to the file.<br>
->
-> <br>Ente itself will read it from either place.
-
-Here is a sample of how the JSON would look:
-
-```json
-{
-    "description": "This will be imported as the caption",
-    "creationTime": {
-        "timestamp": "1613532136",
-        "formatted": "17 Feb 2021, 03:22:16 UTC"
-    },
-    "modificationTime": {
-        "timestamp": "1640225957",
-        "formatted": "23 Dec 2021, 02:19:17 UTC"
-    },
-    "geoData": {
-        "latitude": 12.004170700000001,
-        "longitude": 79.8013945
-    }
-}
-```
-
-`photoTakenTime` will be considered as an alias for `creationTime`, and
-`geoDataExif` will be considered as a fallback for `geoData`.
-
-### File creation time.
-
-The photo's data will be preserved verbatim, however when it is written out to
-disk on a new machine a new file gets created. This file will not have the same
-file system creation time as the file that was uploaded.
-
-1. "Creation time" is not a universal concept, e.g. Linux does not support it.
-   From the man page of [fstat](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstat), we can see
-   that this information is just not recorded by the file system on Linux.
-
-2. The isn't a way to set it even on Windows and macOS for files downloaded from
-   the browser, or for files saved from the mobile apps.
-
-We have considered modifying our desktop and CLI clients to write back the
-photo's creation time into the creation time of the filesytem file during
-export. But it is not clear if this would be less or more confusing. There are
-two main downsides:
-
-1. It will be inconsistent. This behaviour would only happen on Windows and
-   macOS, and only when using the desktop or CLI, not for other Ente clients.
-   Learning from our experience of modifying DateTimeOriginal, we feel
-   consistency is important.
-
-2. It will require workarounds. e.g. for the desktop app, Node.js doesn't
-   natively support modifying the creation time (for similar reasons as
-   described above), and we will have to include binary packages like
-   [utimes](https://github.com/baileyherbert/utimes).
-
-We will also note that Ente is a photos app, not a file system backup app. The
-customers for whom the creation time of the file on disk is paramount might be
-better served by file backup apps, not a photos app.
+---
 
-All this said though, nothing is set in stone. If enough customers deem it
-important, we will prioritize adding support for the workaround.

+title: Search and Discovery FAQ
+description: Frequently asked questions about finding photos using map, face recognition, and search in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Search and Discovery
+
+## Map View
+
+### Why doesn't the map show all my photos? {#missing-photos}
+
+Photos appear on the map only if they have GPS location data embedded in their metadata. Photos may not appear on the map if:
+- They were taken without location services enabled
+- Location data was stripped during export/transfer
+- They were screenshots or downloaded images (which typically don't have location data)
+- They were taken on devices with GPS disabled
+
+You can manually add location data to photos that don't have it. See [Metadata and Editing FAQ](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing#add-location).
+
+### Is my location data sent to Ente servers? {#privacy}
+
+No. Your location data is end-to-end encrypted, just like your photos. When you view photos on the map, the map view uses the encrypted location coordinates stored with your photos.
+
+Ente's servers cannot see:
+- Where your photos were taken
+- Your location tags
+- Map view usage
+
+All location-based searches happen locally on your device. Learn more in our [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy).
+
+### Can I view all albums on the map at once? {#all-albums}
+
+Yes! By default, the map view shows photos from all your albums. You can also:
+- View a specific album on the map by opening that album and selecting "Map" from the menu
+- Filter the map view by date range
+- Zoom in to see photos from specific locations
+
+### How do I access the map view? {#access-map}
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Tap the search icon at the bottom right
+2. Tap the globe icon (Your map) in the location section
+3. Explore your photos on the map
+
+**From an album:**
+- Open any album
+- Tap the three dots menu
+- Select "Map"
+- View only that album's photos on the map
+
+Learn more in the [Map and location guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/map-and-location).
+
+## Location Tags
+
+### How are location tags different from map view? {#location-tags-vs-map}
+
+**Map view** shows photos based on GPS coordinates embedded in the photo's metadata. It displays all photos that have location data.
+
+**Location tags** are custom labels you create to organize photos by location. You can:
+- Create tags like "Home", "Office", "Paris Trip"
+- Define a center point and radius
+- Search for photos within that area
+- Tag photos that don't have GPS data
+
+Location tags are useful for:
+- Organizing photos from places you visit frequently
+- Finding photos from a general area (not just exact GPS points)
+- Tagging photos that don't have GPS coordinates
+
+Learn more about [Map and location](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/map-and-location).
+
+### How do I create location tags? {#create-location-tags}
+
+**From a photo:**
+1. Open a photo
+2. Click Info (i)
+3. Select "Add Location"
+4. Enter the location name and define a radius
+
+**From the search tab:**
+1. Open the search tab
+2. Click "Add new" in the location tags section
+3. Select a photo as the center point
+4. Enter the location name and define a radius
+
+The app will automatically cluster photos falling within that radius under your specified location tag.
+
+### Are my location tags encrypted? {#location-tags-encryption}
+
+Yes! Location tags are stored end-to-end encrypted, just like your photos. When you create a location tag, all the location data (coordinates, radius, and tag name) is encrypted on your device before being synced.
+
+Ente's servers cannot see your location tags or where your photos were taken.
+
+## Machine Learning and Face Recognition
+
+### Why doesn't search work for me? {#search-not-working}
+
+If you're searching for objects (like "food", "car", "dog") or trying to find faces but nothing appears, you likely need to enable **Machine Learning (ML)**.
+
+⚠️ **Machine Learning is OFF by default** and must be manually enabled.
+
+**What ML enables:**
+- Face recognition and grouping
+- Magic search (search by objects, scenes, colors)
+- Advanced photo indexing
+
+**Where to enable ML:**
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning` and toggle ON face recognition and magic search.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning` and toggle ON face recognition and magic search.
+
+**Important limitations:**
+- ❌ ML does NOT work on web.ente.io (web browser)
+- ✅ ML only works on desktop and mobile apps
+- Initial indexing can take time depending on library size
+
+### How do I enable face recognition? {#enable-face-recognition}
+
+Face recognition requires enabling **Machine Learning** first:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning`, enable "Face recognition", and wait for indexing to complete.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning`, enable "Face recognition", and monitor indexing progress in the app.
+
+**After enabling:**
+- The app downloads and indexes your photos locally
+- Progress is shown as a percentage (e.g., "Indexing... 45%")
+- Faster on WiFi and desktop computers
+- Once complete, faces are grouped automatically
+
+**Troubleshooting:**
+- If stuck at 100% but faces don't appear, try disabling and re-enabling ML
+- Make sure you're using the desktop or mobile app, NOT web.ente.io
+- Check that indexing has actually completed (not just showing 100%)
+
+Learn more in the [Machine learning guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning).
+
+### Can I merge or de-merge persons recognized by the app? {#merge-persons}
+
+Yes! The general mechanism for doing this is to assign the same name to both persons.
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+First, make sure one of the two person groupings is assigned a name through the `Add a name` banner. Then for the second grouping, use the same banner but now instead of typing the name again, tap on the already given name that should now be listed.
+
+De-merging a certain grouping can be done by going to the person, pressing `Review suggestions` and then the top right `History icon`. Now press on the `minus icon` beside the group you want to de-merge.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Similarly, on desktop you can use the "Add a name" button to merge people by selecting an existing person, and use the "Review suggestions" sheet to de-merge previously merged persons (click the top right history icon on the suggestion sheet to see the previous merges, and if necessary, undo them).
+
+### How can I remove an incorrectly grouped face from a person? {#remove-incorrect-face}
+
+On our mobile app, open up the person from the People section, click on the three dots to open up overflow menu, and click on Edit. Now you will be presented with the list of all photos that were merged to create this person.
+
+You can click on the merged photos and select the photos you think are incorrectly grouped (by long-pressing on them) and select "Remove" from the action bar that pops up to remove any incorrect faces.
+
+### How do I change the cover for a recognized person? {#change-person-cover}
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Inside the person group, long-press the image you want to use as cover. Then press `Use as cover`.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Desktop currently does not support picking a cover. It will default to the most recent image.
+
+### Can I tell the app to ignore certain recognized person? {#ignore-person}
+
+Yes! You can tell the app not to show certain persons.
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+First, make sure the person is not named. If you already gave a name, then first press `Remove person label` in the top right menu. Now inside the unnamed grouping, press `Ignore person` from the top right menu.
+
+To undo this action, go to a **photo containing the person**. Open the **file info** section of the photo and press on the **face thumbnail of the ignored person**. This will take you to the grouping of this person. Here you can press `Show person` to undo ignoring the person.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Similarly, on desktop, you use the "Ignore" option from the top right menu to ignore a particular face group (If you already give them a name, "Reset person" first). And to undo this action, open that person (via the file info of a photo containing that person), and select "Show person".
+
+### How well does the app handle photos of babies? {#baby-photos}
+
+The face recognition model we use (or any face recognition model for that matter) is known to struggle with pictures of babies and toddlers. While we can't prevent all cases where this goes wrong, we've added a option to help you correct the model in such cases.
+
+If you find a mixed grouping of several different babies, you can use the `mixed grouping` option in the top right menu of said grouping. Activating this option will make the model re-evaluate the grouping with stricter settings, hopefully separating the different babies in different new groupings.
+
+Please note this functionality is currently only available on mobile.
+
+### Does face recognition work offline? {#ml-offline}
+
+Yes! Once your photos have been indexed, face recognition and magic search work completely offline. The initial indexing requires downloading your photos (which happens faster over WiFi), but after that all searches happen locally on your device. The indexes are synced across your devices using end-to-end encryption.
+
+### Is my face data used to train AI models? {#face-data-training}
+
+No. All machine learning (face recognition and magic search) happens entirely on your device. Your photos are downloaded to your device, indexed locally, and the indexes are encrypted before being synced across your devices.
+
+Ente's servers never receive:
+- Your unencrypted photos
+- Face recognition data
+- Search indexes
+- Any information about what's in your photos
+
+Your photos and ML data are never used to train any AI models, neither by Ente nor by any third parties.
+
+Learn more in our [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#ml-privacy).
+
+### Why is face recognition faster on desktop? {#face-recognition-speed}
+
+Desktop computers typically have:
+- More powerful processors
+- More RAM
+- Faster network connections over Ethernet/WiFi
+
+This makes the initial indexing process significantly faster. We recommend enabling machine learning on desktop first if you have a large library. Once indexed, the data syncs to your mobile devices, and they can then quickly index new photos.
+
+### Can I name the recognized persons? {#name-persons}
+
+Yes! Once the app has grouped faces:
+
+1. Open the People section
+2. Tap on a person cluster
+3. Tap "Add name" or the edit icon
+4. Enter the person's name
+
+You can then search for photos by person name.
+
+## Magic Search
+
+### What is magic search? {#what-is-magic-search}
+
+Magic search lets you find photos using natural language descriptions. You can search for things like:
+- "night"
+- "by the seaside"
+- "the red motorcycle next to a fountain"
+- "sunset"
+- "birthday cake"
+
+The app uses on-device AI to understand the content of your photos and match your search queries.
+
+### How do I enable magic search? {#enable-magic-search}
+
+Magic search is enabled when you enable machine learning:
+
+**On mobile:**
+- `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning`
+
+**On desktop:**
+- `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning`
+
+After enabling, the app will index your photos locally. Once indexing is complete, you can use magic search.
+
+### Does magic search require internet? {#magic-search-offline}
+
+No! Magic search works completely offline after the initial indexing. All processing happens on your device.
+
+However, the initial indexing requires downloading your photos, which is faster over WiFi.
+
+### Can I search for photos using the descriptions I've added? {#search-descriptions}
+
+Yes! Descriptions (captions) you add to photos are searchable, making it easier to find specific photos later.
+
+**To add a description:**
+1. Open the photo
+2. Tap the info button (i)
+3. Enter your description
+4. Save
+
+You can then search for words in those descriptions to find the photos.
+
+Learn more in [Metadata and Editing FAQ](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing#descriptions).
+
+## General Search
+
+### How do I search my photos? {#how-to-search}
+
+Ente supports multiple search types:
+
+**Date search**: Search by date, month, or year
+**Location search**: Find photos taken in specific locations (if they have GPS data)
+**Magic search**: Natural language descriptions of photo content
+**Face search**: Find photos of specific people
+**Description search**: Search descriptions/captions you've added
+**File name search**: Search by original file name
+
+Simply type in the search bar and Ente will show matching results across all these categories.
+
+### Can I save my searches? {#save-searches}
+
+Currently, you cannot save searches. However, you can:
+- Create albums for specific types of photos
+- Use location tags to organize by place
+- Name persons in face recognition for quick access
+
+### Does search include archived or hidden photos? {#search-archived-hidden}
+
+**Archived photos**: Yes, archived photos appear in search results. Archiving only removes photos from your timeline.
+
+**Hidden photos**: No, hidden photos do not appear in search results. They're completely removed from all views except the special "Hidden" section.
+
+Learn more in [Albums and Organization FAQ](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#hide-vs-archive).
+
+### Indexing stuck at 100% but faces don't appear {#indexing-stuck-no-faces}
+
+If indexing shows 100% but you don't see faces:
+1. Make sure you're using the mobile or desktop app (not web.ente.io)
+2. Try disabling and re-enabling machine learning
+3. Check that indexing has truly completed (not just displaying 100%)
+4. Restart the app
+
+### Faces not being grouped correctly {#faces-not-grouped-correctly}
+
+If face grouping quality is poor:
+- For baby photos, use the **mixed grouping** feature (mobile only)
+- Manually merge persons that should be together
+- Remove incorrect faces from groupings
+- Face recognition works better with clear, front-facing photos
+
+Learn more about [handling baby photos](/photos/faq/search-and-discovery#babies).
+
+### Can't modify face groupings on desktop {#cant-modify-faces-desktop}
+
+This is a current limitation. To edit face groupings (remove incorrect faces, change covers), use the mobile app. Desktop can view and name persons but cannot modify the groupings.
+
+### Performance issues during indexing {#ml-performance-issues}
+
+If indexing is slow or affecting performance:
+- **Mobile**: Consider disabling local indexing and using desktop instead
+- **Desktop**: Indexing is CPU intensive but temporary
+- Enable on desktop first for large libraries
+
+Learn more in [Machine learning configuration](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning#local-indexing-configuration).
+
+### Magic search not finding relevant photos {#magic-search-not-finding}
+
+If search results aren't what you expect:
+- Try different phrasing or synonyms
+- Be more specific with your query
+- Check that indexing has completed
+- Try combining multiple descriptive terms
+
+### Machine learning features not working {#ml-features-not-working}
+
+If face recognition or magic search isn't available:
+- Ensure you're using mobile or desktop app (not web.ente.io)
+- Check that machine learning is enabled in ML settings
+- Verify indexing has completed
+- Restart the app
+
+Note: Machine learning features only work on mobile and desktop apps, not on web.ente.io.

+
+Your **recovery key is a 24-word phrase** that is the ONLY way to recover your account if you:
+- Forget your password AND
+- Are logged out of all devices
+
+**Critical information about recovery keys:**
+
+⚠️ **Ente support CANNOT provide or regenerate your recovery key**. Due to end-to-end encryption, we never have access to your recovery key or your encrypted data.
+
+⚠️ **Without your recovery key, losing your password means permanently losing access** to all your photos if you're logged out everywhere.
+
+⚠️ **Your recovery key is different from verification codes**. Verification codes are temporary 6-digit numbers sent to your email. Your recovery key is a permanent 24-word phrase.
+
+### How do I find my recovery key? {#find-recovery-key}
+
+**If you're still logged in to Ente on any device:**
+
+Open `Settings > Account > Recovery key`, enter your password to view your 24-word recovery key, and **save it immediately** in a secure location.
+
+**If you're logged out of all devices and don't have your recovery key:**
+
+Unfortunately, there is no way to recover your account. This is an inherent property of end-to-end encryption - for your privacy and security, only you have access to your data.
+
+### How should I store my recovery key? {#store-recovery-key}
+
+**Recommended methods:**
+
+1. **Password manager**: Store it in a reputable password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
+2. **Physical paper**: Write it down and store it in a safe place (fireproof safe, safety deposit box)
+3. **Encrypted notes**: Save it in an encrypted notes app with a different password
+4. **Multiple locations**: Store copies in 2-3 different secure locations
+
+**DO NOT:**
+- Store it in an unencrypted file on your computer
+- Email it to yourself
+- Share it with anyone (not even Ente support)
+- Take a screenshot and leave it in your photos
+- Store it only in one location
+
+**Best practice**: When you first create your Ente account, immediately save your recovery key before uploading any photos.
+
+### How do I use my recovery key to reset my password? {#use-recovery-key}
+
+If you've forgotten your password and are logged out everywhere:
+
+1. Open the login page (on any platform)
+2. Enter your email address
+3. Click "Forgot Password"
+4. Enter your 24-word recovery key
+   - Type each word separated by a single space
+   - All lowercase, no punctuation
+   - Example format: `word1 word2 word3 ... word24`
+5. Create a new password
+6. Log in with your new password

+
+# Sharing and Collaboration
+
+## Understanding Sharing Methods
+
+### What are the different ways to share in Ente? {#sharing-methods}
+
+Ente offers three main ways to share photos, each designed for different use cases:
+
+**1. Shared albums (with Ente users)**
+
+Share directly with specific people who have Ente accounts:
+- Invite by email address
+- Recipients need an Ente account
+- Choose Viewer or Collaborator permissions
+- Each photo's storage counts towards whoever uploaded it
+- Perfect for ongoing collaboration with family and friends
+
+Learn more: [Collaboration guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration)
+
+**2. Public links (for anyone)**
+
+Share via links that anyone can access without an account:
+- **Regular public links**: View-only access to an album
+- **Quick links**: Select photos → create link (Ente creates hidden album automatically)
+- **Collect links**: Enable "Allow adding photos" so anyone can contribute
+- Password protection, expiry, and device limits available
+- Custom domains supported
+
+Learn more: [Public links guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/public-links)
+
+**3. Collaborative albums (Ente users working together)**
+
+Multiple Ente users can add photos to the same album:
+- All collaborators can contribute photos
+- Each person's uploads count towards their own storage
+- Owner controls permissions and membership
+- Currently full support on mobile, view-only on web/desktop
+
+Learn more: [Collaboration guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration)
+
+For a complete overview, see [Sharing documentation](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/share).
+
+### What's the difference between public links and quick links? {#link-types}
+
+Quick links ARE public links - just with a different creation method:
+
+**Public links:**
+- Create from an existing album
+- Share the entire album via link
+
+**Quick links:**
+- Select specific photos anywhere in Ente
+- Ente creates a hidden album automatically
+- Share via link (works exactly like a public link)
+- Can convert to regular album later
+
+Both support the same features: password protection, expiry, device limits, collect mode, and custom domains.
+
+Learn more: [Public links guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/public-links)
+
+### Can I use my own domain for public links? {#custom-domains}
+
+Yes! Ente's custom domains feature lets you serve your public album links using your own personalized domain instead of `albums.ente.io`.
+
+For example, instead of:
+```
+https://albums.ente.io/?t=...
+```
+
+You can use:
+```
+https://pics.example.org/?t=...
+```
+
+**Requirements:**
+- Active Ente subscription (required for public sharing)
+- Your own domain or subdomain
+- Ability to add a CNAME DNS record
+
+**Setup:**
+1. Link your domain in `Settings > Preferences > Custom domains` (currently web only)
+2. Add a CNAME DNS record pointing your domain to `my.ente.io`
+3. Wait for DNS changes to propagate (usually a few minutes)
+
+Once configured, Ente automatically uses your custom domain when creating new public links. Ente still hosts and serves your albums - only the URL changes.
+
+Learn more in the [Custom domains guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/custom-domains/).
+
+### Do Trip albums work with custom domains? {#trip-custom-domains}
+
+Trip albums (albums with the Trip layout feature) are not currently supported on custom domains. When someone tries to access a Trip album through your custom domain, they will be automatically redirected to the default `albums.ente.io` domain.
+
+Regular albums continue to work perfectly on your custom domain - only the Trip layout feature has this limitation.
+
+Learn more in the [Custom domains guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/custom-domains/).
+
+
+## Collaboration
+
+### How do I share an album with other Ente users? {#share-with-users}
+
+1. Open the album you want to share
+2. Tap/click the Share icon
+3. Select "Share with Ente users" or enter email addresses
+4. Choose permissions (Viewer or Collaborator)
+5. Send the invitation
+
+The recipient will receive a notification and can access the shared album from their Ente app. They must have an Ente account to receive shared albums.
+
+### Who pays for storage in collaborative albums? {#collab-storage}
+
+In collaborative albums (shared with other Ente users):
+- Each photo's storage is counted towards **the person who uploaded it**
+- Since collaborators usually already have the photo in their account, they effectively don't pay extra
+- The album owner does not pay for photos uploaded by collaborators
+
+In collect links (public links with upload enabled):
+- All photos added via the link count towards **the album owner's storage**
+- The owner has full control to remove photos at any time
+- People adding photos via the link don't need Ente accounts and don't pay anything
+
+Learn more: [Collaboration guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration)
+
+### Can collaborators delete photos from shared albums? {#collab-permissions}
+
+Permissions depend on your role:
+
+**Collaborators can:**
+- Add photos to the shared album
+- Delete photos they uploaded themselves
+- View all photos in the album
+
+**Collaborators cannot:**
+- Delete photos uploaded by others
+- Delete the album itself
+- Change album settings or permissions
+
+**Album owner can:**
+- Remove any photos from the album
+- Only permanently delete photos they own
+- Remove or change permissions for collaborators
+- Delete the entire album
+
+### What happens when I remove a collaborator from an album? {#remove-collaborator}
+
+When a collaborator is removed from a shared album (or when they leave the album voluntarily):
+- Any photos they uploaded to the album will also be removed from that album
+- Those photos remain in the collaborator's own account
+- Photos uploaded by other collaborators or the owner remain in the album
+- The removed collaborator loses access to view the album
+
+### Is collaboration available on all platforms? {#collaboration-platforms}
+
+**Collaborative albums** (sharing with other Ente users):
+- Fully supported on mobile apps (iOS and Android)
+- View-only mode on web and desktop (we're actively working on adding full support)
+
+**Collaborative links** (collect links):
+- Can be created on all platforms (mobile, web, desktop)
+- Anyone with the link can add photos via web browser
+
+### Why am I not getting notifications when photos are added to shared albums? {#shared-album-notifications}
+
+**On iOS:**
+
+Notification limitations on iOS are due to Apple's platform restrictions:
+
+⚠️ **Notifications only work when the app is running in the background**, not if you've force-closed it from the app switcher.
+
+**Why this happens:**
+- iOS delivers notifications via silent push notifications
+- These "wake up" the app to check for new photos
+- If you force-kill the app, iOS won't deliver these notifications
+- This is an Apple platform limitation, not an Ente bug
+
+**To receive notifications on iOS:**
+1. Enable notifications in device `Settings > Ente > Notifications`
+2. Enable Background App Refresh in device `Settings > Ente`
+3. **Don't force-close the Ente app** from the app switcher
+4. The app can run in the background without draining battery
+
+**On Android:**
+
+Notifications work more reliably on Android, but can still be affected by:
+- Battery optimization settings restricting the app
+- Force-closing the app from recents
+- Notification permissions not granted
+
+**To receive notifications on Android:**
+1. Open device `Settings > Ente > Notifications` and ensure all notification categories are enabled
+2. Disable battery optimization for Ente in system settings
+3. Don't force-close the app from recents
+
+**Alternative:**
+If you need real-time updates, keep the app open or check the shared album manually by opening it in the app.
+- No platform restrictions for link recipients
+
+## Public Links
+
+### How do I create a collect link to gather photos from others? {#create-collect-link}
+
+Collect links let anyone add photos to your album without needing an Ente account - perfect for gathering photos from events, parties, or trips.
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the album you want to use for collecting photos
+2. Tap the Share icon in the top right corner
+3. Select "Collect photos"
+4. Tap "Copy link"
+5. Share the link with anyone you want to collect photos from
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+1. Open the album
+2. Click the share album icon
+3. Select "Collect photos"
+4. Click "Copy link"
+5. Share the link via email, messaging, or however you prefer
+
+Anyone with the link can view existing photos and add their own through their web browser. All collected photos count toward your storage quota. Learn more in the [Collaboration guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration).
+
+### Can people without Ente add photos to my album? {#collect-without-account}
+
+Yes! When you create a collect link (public link with "Allow adding photos" enabled), anyone with the link can view and add photos using just their web browser - no Ente account or app installation required.
+
+This is perfect for collecting event photos from a large group of people, like weddings, parties, or trips, where not everyone uses Ente.
+
+To enable this, create a public link and enable the "Allow adding photos" option. Learn more in the [Collaboration guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration).
+
+### Do collected photos count against my storage? {#collect-storage}
+
+Yes, photos added to your album through a collect link count towards your storage quota as the album owner.
+
+When someone adds a photo via a collect link:
+- The photo is stored in your account
+- You have full control to remove these photos at any time
+- The storage counts against your plan's total storage limit
+
+Make sure you have sufficient storage available if you're expecting many people to add photos.
+
+### Can I set limits on public links? {#link-limits}
+
+Yes! Public links (including collect links) support several protective features:
+
+- **Link expiry**: Set the link to automatically expire after a duration you define
+- **Device limits**: Prevent people from forwarding your link to too many devices
+- **Password protection**: Add an additional password that users must enter to access the link
+- **Prevent downloads**: Disable the option to download original photos (though screenshots can't be prevented)
+
+These options help you maintain control over who can access and contribute to your shared albums.
+
+### Can I stop people from adding more photos to a collect link? {#disable-collect-link}
+
+Yes, you have several options:
+
+1. **Remove the link entirely**: Delete the public link from your sharing settings
+2. **Set an expiry date**: Configure the link to automatically expire after a certain time
+3. **Disable uploads**: Edit the link settings and turn off "Allow adding photos"
+4. **Change to view-only**: Convert the collect link to a regular public link (view only)
+
+You can manage these settings by going to your Sharing section and selecting the link you want to modify.
+
+### Can I see who added photos to my collect link? {#collect-link-attribution}
+
+When photos are added via a collect link (by people without Ente accounts), you cannot see specifically who added each photo. The photos will appear in your album without attribution.
+
+In collaborative albums (with other Ente users), you can see who uploaded each photo by viewing the photo's info.
+
+## Public Link Features
+
+### Can I convert a quick link to a regular album? {#quick-link-convert}
+
+Yes! Quick links automatically create a special album behind the scenes. You can convert this to a regular album at any time:
+
+1. Open the Sharing tab in the Ente app
+2. Find the quick link under "Quick links" section
+3. Select the option to convert it to a regular album
+
+This gives you more control over the album, including the ability to rename it and organize it like any other album.
+
+### How do I create a quick link? {#create-quick-link}
+
+1. Select one or more photos (without creating an album)
+2. Tap/click the Share button
+3. Select "Create quick link"
+4. Copy and share the link
+
+Ente creates a special album behind the scenes with the selected photos. Quick links work like public links and support the same features (password protection, expiry, etc.).
+
+## Managing Shared Content
+
+### Can I add photos from a shared album to my own albums? {#add-shared-photos}
+
+Yes, on Ente's mobile apps, you can add photos from an album that's shared with you into one of your own albums.
+
+**Important**: This creates a copy of the photo that you fully own, and it will count against your storage quota. This is different from just viewing shared photos, which doesn't use your storage.
+
+The reason for creating copies is to avoid complications around ownership - if the original owner deletes the photo from their library, your copy remains safe in your account.
+
+### Why does adding shared photos to my albums count against my storage? {#shared-storage-count}
+
+When you add a shared photo to your own album, Ente creates a hard copy that you fully own. This ensures that:
+
+1. **You maintain control**: The photo remains in your account even if the original owner deletes it
+2. **Ownership is clear**: There's no ambiguity about who owns which version of the photo
+3. **No dependency**: Your organized albums don't break if someone stops sharing with you
+
+We understand this uses extra storage in some use cases (like family photo sharing). We're exploring reference-based solutions in the future where storage would only count if the original is deleted. See [this discussion](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/790) for more details.
+
+### Can I remove myself from a shared album? {#leave-shared-album}
+
+Yes, if someone has shared an album with you, you can leave it at any time:
+
+1. Open the shared album
+2. Tap/click the three dots menu
+3. Select "Leave album"
+
+After leaving, you'll no longer have access to the album. If you were a collaborator and uploaded photos, those photos will be removed from the album but remain in your own account.
+
+### How do I see all my shared albums? {#view-shared-albums}
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Open the Albums tab
+- Shared albums appear alongside your own albums
+- Look for the "Shared by" indicator under the album name
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Shared albums appear in your album list
+- They're marked with a sharing icon
+
+You can also view all sharing activity in the Sharing tab/section.
+
+## Permissions and Access
+
+### Who can create collaborative albums or public links? {#who-can-share}
+
+**Collaborative albums and public links are only available to paid customers.** This limitation helps safeguard against potential platform abuse.
+
+However, receiving shared albums is available to everyone:
+- Free users can receive and view albums shared with them
+- Free users can view public links shared with them
+- Anyone (with or without Ente account) can add photos to collect links
+
+To create shares or collaborative albums, you'll need a paid subscription.
+
+### Can I change permissions for collaborators after sharing? {#change-permissions}
+
+Yes, the album owner can change permissions at any time:
+
+1. Open the shared album
+2. Open sharing settings
+3. Find the collaborator
+4. Change their role from Collaborator to Viewer (or vice versa)
+
+Viewers can only view photos, while Collaborators can both view and add photos.
+
+### What happens to shared albums if I cancel my subscription? {#cancel-subscription-impact}
+
+If you're the owner of shared albums and your paid subscription expires:
+- Existing shared albums will remain accessible to collaborators
+- You won't be able to create new shares
+- You won't be able to modify existing share settings
+
+Receiving shared albums works on free accounts, so if someone shares with you, you can still access those albums even without a paid plan.
+
+## Security and Privacy
+
+### Are public links end-to-end encrypted? {#public-link-encryption}
+
+Yes, content shared via public links remains end-to-end encrypted. However, the decryption keys are embedded in the link itself (as a URL fragment that never reaches our servers). This means anyone with the link can decrypt and view the content. For sensitive content, use password protection and link expiration features to add extra security layers.
+
+Learn more about [public link encryption](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#public-link-encryption) in our Security and Privacy FAQ.
+
+### How does sharing work with encryption? {#sharing-encryption-technical}
+
+The information required to decrypt an album is encrypted with the recipient's public key such that only they can decrypt them.
+
+You can read more about this in our [architecture documentation](https://ente.io/architecture#sharing).
+
+In case of sharable links, the key to decrypt the album is appended by the client as a [fragment to the URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment), and is never sent to our servers.
+
+### Can Ente see my shared photos? {#ente-see-shared}
+
+No. Ente has no information about:
+- Whether you have shared an album
+- What photos are in shared albums
+- Who you've shared with
+- What's in public links
+
+All sharing happens with end-to-end encryption. Only people you share with (or who have the link) can decrypt and view the content.
+
+## Embedding Albums
+
+### How do I embed an album on my website? {#embed-albums}
+
+Ente allows you to embed public albums on your own website or blog using an iframe, similar to how you would embed a YouTube video.
+
+**Easy method (recommended):**
+
+1. Open the album in [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io)
+2. Open the album's sharing settings
+3. Create a public link (if you haven't already)
+4. Open the link settings ("Manage link")
+5. Click the "Copy embed HTML" button
+
+This copies ready-to-use iframe code that you can paste directly into your website's HTML.
+
+**Manual method:**
+
+Create a public link for your album, then add an iframe to your HTML with the URL, replacing `albums.ente.io` with `embed.ente.io`:
+
+```html
+<iframe
+    src="https://embed.ente.io/?t=...#..."
+    width="800"
+    height="600"
+    frameborder="0"
+    allowfullscreen
+>
+</iframe>
+```
+
+For complete details, see the [Embed albums guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/embed).
+
+### Do embedded albums work with custom domains? {#embed-custom-domains}
+
+Yes, but you need to use `embed.ente.io` instead of your custom domain in the iframe src.
+
+If you're using the easy method (copy embed HTML button), the app automatically handles this for you - it will use `embed.ente.io` regardless of your custom domain setting.
+
+If you're creating the embed code manually and have a custom domain configured:
+- Replace your custom domain with `embed.ente.io` in the iframe src
+- For example: `https://embed.ente.io/?t=...` (not `https://pics.example.org/?t=...`)
+
+The embed will still work perfectly - it's just served from the embed subdomain instead of your custom domain.
+
+### Can I embed password-protected albums? {#embed-password}
+
+Yes! Password-protected albums work in embeds. When someone views the embedded album, they'll see a password prompt within the iframe. Once they enter the correct password, they can view the photos.
+
+The embed maintains all the security features of your public link:
+- Password protection (if enabled)
+- Same end-to-end encryption
+- Link expiry (if set)
+- Device limits (if set)
+
+### What happens to my embed if I delete the public link? {#embed-deletion}
+
+If you delete the public link, the embed will immediately stop working. The embedded album requires an active public link to function.
+
+If you want to stop people from accessing the embedded album:
+1. Delete the public link from the album's sharing settings
+2. The embed will show an error or empty state
+3. Remove the embed code from your website
+
+If you just want to temporarily disable access, consider using the link's password protection or expiry features instead of deleting it entirely.
+
+### What features are available in embedded albums? {#embed-features}
+
+Embedded albums include:
+- Thumbnail grid view
+- Full-size image viewer with navigation
+- Video playback support
+- Fullscreen mode (when `allowfullscreen` attribute is set)
+- Password protection (if enabled on the link)
+- Automatic updates when you add new photos to the album
+
+You can customize the embed size using iframe width/height attributes, including responsive sizing with percentages.
+
+See the [Embed feature guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/embed) for customization examples.

+---
+
+# Storage and Plans
+
+## Understanding Storage
+
+### Why does Ente consume less storage than other providers? {#less-storage-usage}
+
+Most storage providers compute your storage quota in GigaBytes (GBs) by dividing your total bytes uploaded by `1000 x 1000 x 1000`.
+
+Ente on the other hand, computes your storage quota in GibiBytes (GiBs) by dividing your total bytes uploaded by `1024 x 1024 x 1024`.
+
+We decided to leave out the **i** from **GiBs** to reduce noise on our interfaces.
+
+This means that the same file appears to take up less "storage" on Ente compared to providers using GB (base-1000) calculation.
+
+### How does Ente deduplicate photos? {#deduplication}
+
+Ente automatically detects and handles duplicate files during backup to save storage space:
+
+**During uploads:**
+- If you try to upload the same file to the same album, Ente will skip it entirely
+- If you upload the same file to different albums, Ente creates a symlink (reference) instead of storing it again
+- This means storage is only counted once, even if the photo appears in multiple albums
+
+This happens automatically in the background without any action required from you.
+
+Learn more in the [Duplicate detection guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).
+
+### Does Ente deduplicate across different albums? {#dedup-albums}
+
+Yes! During the initial upload, if the same file is being uploaded to multiple albums, Ente creates symlinks (references) instead of uploading duplicates. This means the storage is only counted once, even if the photo appears in multiple albums.
+
+Learn more in the [Duplicate detection guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).
+
+### How can I optimize my storage usage? {#optimize-storage}
+
+Ente provides several tools to help you optimize both your device storage and cloud storage:
+
+**Free up device space:**
+- Remove backed-up photos from your phone to reclaim device storage
+- Photos remain in Ente and can be re-downloaded anytime
+
+**Remove exact duplicates:**
+- Find and remove duplicate files across your entire library
+- Maintains your album structure while freeing up storage
+
+**Remove similar images:**
+- Use ML to find visually similar (but not identical) photos
+- Keep only the best shots and delete the rest
+
+Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+### Do items in trash count against my storage? {#trash-storage-count}
+
+Yes, items in trash are included in your storage quota calculation. To free up storage space, you can:
+- Manually empty your trash
+- Permanently delete specific items
+- Wait for automatic deletion after 30 days
+
+Once files are permanently deleted (either manually or after 30 days), the storage space will be freed up and reflected in your account.
+
+Learn more in [Albums and Organization FAQ](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#trash).
+
+### What happens if I exceed my storage limit? {#exceed-storage}
+
+Ente will stop backing up your files and you will receive an email alerting you of the same.
+
+Your backed up files will remain accessible for as long as you have an active subscription.
+
+To continue backing up:
+- Upgrade to a higher storage plan, OR
+- Delete files you no longer need and empty trash to free up space
+
+## Subscription Plans
+
+### What plans does Ente offer? {#available-plans}
+
+See our [website](https://ente.io#pricing) for the complete list of supported plans and pricing.
+
+We offer:
+- **Free plan**: 10 GB storage
+- **Paid plans**: Multiple tiers ranging from 50 GB to multiple TBs
+- **Monthly and annual billing**: Annual plans offer better value
+- **Family plans**: Share your storage with up to 5 family members
+
+### Is there a forever-free plan? {#free-plan}
+
+Yes, we offer 10 GB of storage for free, forever.
+
+### What are the limitations of the free plan? {#free-plan-limits}
+
+On the free plan, you cannot:
+- Share albums or create public links
+- Set up family plans
+
+All other features work on the free plan, including:
+- Unlimited devices
+- End-to-end encryption
+- Map view
+- Machine learning (face recognition, magic search)
+- Background sync
+- Receiving shared albums from others
+
+### Is there an x GB plan? {#specific-plan-size}
+
+We have experimented quite a bit and have found it hard to design a single structure that fits all needs. Some customers wish for many options, some even wish to go to an extreme of dynamic per GB pricing. Other customers wish to keep everything simple, some even wish for a single unlimited plan.
+
+To keep things fair, our plans don't increase linearly, and the tiers are such that they cover the most requested patterns.
+
+In addition, we also offer [family plans](/photos/features/account/family-plans) so that you can gain more value out of a single subscription.
+
+If you need a custom plan, please contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io).
+
+## Family Plans
+
+### Does Ente have Family Plans? {#family-plans-faq}
+
+Yes we do! Please check out our announcement post [here](https://ente.io/blog/family-plans).
+
+In brief:
+
+- Your family members can use storage space from your plan without paying extra.
+- Ask them to sign up for Ente, and then just add them to your existing plan using the "Manage family" option within your Subscription settings.
+- Each member gets their own private space, and cannot see each other's files unless they're shared.
+- You can invite 5 family members. So including yourself, it will be 6 people who can share a single subscription, paying only once.
+
+Note that family plans are meant as a way to share storage. For sharing photos, you can create [shared albums and links](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/share).
+
+Learn more in the [Family plans guide](/photos/features/account/family-plans).
+
+### How many family members can I add to my plan? {#family-members-limit}
+
+You can invite up to 5 family members to your plan. Including yourself, a total of 6 people can share a single subscription while paying only once.
+
+### Can family members see each other's photos? {#family-privacy}
+
+No. Each family member gets their own private space, and members cannot see each other's files unless they are explicitly shared using Ente's sharing features. Family plans are only for sharing storage space, not for sharing photos automatically.
+
+### Can I set storage limits for family members? {#family-storage-limits}
+
+Yes! As the family plan admin, you can set storage limits for each member:
+
+1. Open Subscription > Manage family
+2. Find the member you want to limit
+3. Click the edit icon
+4. Set the storage limit (e.g., 10 GB)
+5. Save
+
+If you want to remove any storage limit from a member's account, you can click "Remove Limit" and they can upload photos without any limit (up to the total family plan storage).
+
+### Why does my family member show 0 GB storage after accepting the invite? {#family-member-zero-storage}
+
+If a family member accepted your invitation but their account shows 0 GB of available storage, try these solutions:
+
+**Solution 1: Check if they actually accepted the invite**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Family plans`, check the "Members" list, and confirm their status shows "Active" (not "Invited" or "Pending"). If still showing as "Invited", ask them to check their email and accept the invitation.
+
+**Solution 2: Check if you've set a storage limit**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Family plans`, find the member in the list, click the edit icon next to their name, and check if a storage limit is set to 0 GB or a very low amount. Either increase the limit or click "Remove Limit" to give them unlimited access to the family plan storage.
+
+**Solution 3: Have the member log out and log back in**
+
+1. Ask the family member to log out of their Ente account
+2. Have them log back in
+3. The storage quota should refresh and show correctly
+
+**Solution 4: Check your total family plan storage**
+
+1. Verify your family plan has available storage
+2. If you've exceeded your total plan storage, family members may not be able to upload
+3. Consider upgrading your plan or deleting unwanted files
+
+**If the issue persists:**
+
+Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) with:
+- Your email address (family plan admin)
+- The family member's email address
+- Screenshot of the "Manage family" screen showing the member's status
+
+### Why can't I add a family member? {#cannot-add-family-member}
+
+Common reasons and solutions:
+
+**Problem 1: "You've reached the maximum number of family members"**
+- Family plans allow up to 5 additional members (6 total including you)
+- Remove an existing member before adding a new one
+
+**Problem 2: "This user is already part of another family plan"**
+- Each Ente account can only be part of one family plan at a time
+- The person needs to leave their current family plan first
+- Or create a new Ente account with a different email
+
+**Problem 3: "Invalid email address" or invitation fails**
+- Make sure the email address is correct
+- The person must have an Ente account already (ask them to sign up first at [ente.io](https://ente.io))
+- Free accounts can be invited to family plans
+
+**Problem 4: Family plan not available**
+- Family plans are only available for paid subscriptions
+- Free plan users cannot create family plans
+- Upgrade to any paid plan to access family sharing
+
+**Problem 5: Purchased through App Store**
+- Family plans may have limited functionality for App Store purchases
+- Consider managing your subscription through [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io) instead
+
+### How do I remove someone from my family plan? {#remove-family-member}
+
+Open `Settings > General > Family plans`, find the member you want to remove, click the remove/trash icon next to their name, and confirm the removal.
+
+**What happens when you remove someone:**
+- They lose access to the shared family storage
+- Their photos remain in their account but they'll need their own subscription to continue uploading
+- They'll revert to the free 10 GB plan unless they purchase their own subscription
+- Photos they've already uploaded remain accessible to them

+### Does Ente offer discounts to students? {#student-discount}
+
+Yes we do!
+
+We believe that privacy should be made accessible to everyone. In this spirit, we offer **30% off** our subscription plans to students.
+
+To apply for this discount, please verify your enrollment status in a school / college / university by writing to [students@ente.io](mailto:students@ente.io) from the email address assigned to you by your institute.
+
+In case you do not have access to such an email address, please send us proof (such as your institute's identity card) that verifies your identity as a student.
+
+Please note that these discounts are valid for a year, after which you may reapply to reclaim the discount.
+
+## Discount Codes and Referrals
+
+### How do I apply a discount code to my subscription? {#apply-discount-code}
+
+If you have a discount code (e.g., from partnerships like Kagi Friends 25% off), follow these steps carefully:
+
+⚠️ **CRITICAL: You MUST apply the discount code BEFORE purchasing your subscription.** Discount codes cannot be applied retroactively to existing purchases.
+
+**Step-by-step process:**
+
+1. **Do NOT purchase through the iOS/Android App Store** - App Stores don't support discount codes
+2. Go to [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io) on a desktop or laptop computer
+3. Log in to your Ente account
+4. Open `Settings > Account > Manage subscription`
+5. Click "Buy subscription" or "Change plan"
+6. **BEFORE clicking "Purchase"**, look for the "Apply discount code" field
+7. Enter your discount code in the field
+8. Click "Apply" to verify the code works
+9. Verify the discounted price is shown
+10. Complete your purchase
+
+**Important notes:**
+- Discount codes only work for **NEW paying customers** (first-time purchases)
+- Cannot be applied to existing paid subscriptions
+- Cannot be combined with cryptocurrency payments
+- Must purchase from web.ente.io or desktop app, NOT mobile app stores
+
+**If you already purchased without applying a code:**
+
+Unfortunately, we cannot apply discount codes retroactively. However, you can:
+1. Cancel your current subscription
+2. Wait for the subscription period to end
+3. Resubscribe using the discount code
+
+Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) if you have questions about your specific situation.
+
+## Referral Program
+
+### How can I earn free storage? {#earn-storage-referrals}
+
+Use our [referral program](/photos/features/account/referral-program/):
+
+Open `Settings > General > Referrals`, share your referral code with friends, and when they upgrade to a paid plan, both you and your friend get 10 GB free.
+
+### How much storage can I earn through referrals? {#referral-storage-limit}
+
+For each friend you refer who upgrades to a paid plan, both you and your friend receive **10 GB** of free storage.
+
+The amount of free storage you can earn is capped to your current plan. This means you can at most **double your storage**. For example, if you're on a 100 GB plan, you can earn another 100 GB (by referring 10 friends), taking your total available storage to 200 GB.
+
+You can keep track of your earned storage and referral details on the _Claim free storage_ screen.
+
+If you refer more paid customers than is allowed by your current plan, the extra storage earned will be reserved and will become usable once you upgrade your plan.
+
+Learn more in the [Referral program](/photos/features/account/referral-program/) guide.
+
+### For how long do I have access to referred storage? {#referral-duration}
+
+Earned storage will be accessible as long as your subscription is active, provided there has been no abuse.
+
+### What happens if I refer more people than my plan allows? {#referral-overflow}
+
+If you refer more paid customers than your current plan allows, the extra storage earned will be reserved. This reserved storage will become usable once you upgrade to a higher storage plan.
+
+For example, if you're on a 100 GB plan (max 100 GB earned storage) but refer 15 friends (150 GB worth), the extra 50 GB will be held in reserve until you upgrade to a plan that allows more referral storage.
+
+### What counts as abuse of the referral program? {#referral-abuse}
+
+In case our systems detect abuse, we may notify you and take back credited storage. Examples of abuse include:
+
+- Low quality referrals (users who don't renew their plans)
+- Creation of fake accounts
+- Coordinated schemes to game the referral system
+
+Legitimate referrals of real users who maintain active subscriptions are never affected by abuse detection.
+
+## Payment Methods
+
+### What payment methods does Ente support? {#supported-payment-methods}
+
+On Web, Desktop and Android, Stripe helps us process payments from all major prepaid and credit card providers.
+
+On iOS, we (have to) use the billing platforms provided by the app store.
+
+Apart from these, we also support PayPal and crypto currencies (more details below).
+
+### Can I pay with PayPal? {#paypal-payment}
+
+We support **annual** subscriptions over PayPal.
+
+**How to purchase with PayPal:**
+
+1. Email **paypal@ente.io** from your registered Ente email address
+2. In your email, mention the [storage plan](https://ente.io#pricing) of your choice (e.g., "100 GB annual plan")
+3. We will send you an invoice with a PayPal payment link
+4. Complete the payment through PayPal
+5. Your account will be upgraded once payment is confirmed
+
+**Important notes:**
+- Only annual plans are available via PayPal (monthly plans not supported)

+
+Yes! We accept the following cryptocurrencies:
+
+- **Bitcoin** (BTC)
+- **Ethereum** (ETH)
+- **Dogecoin** (DOGE)
+
+**How to purchase with cryptocurrency:**
+
+1. Email **crypto@ente.io** from your registered Ente email address

+3. We will send you an invoice with payment instructions
+4. Complete the payment using your crypto wallet

+
+**Important limitations:**
+
+⚠️ **Discount codes CANNOT be combined with cryptocurrency payments**. If you have a discount code, you must pay via credit card through web.ente.io instead.
+
+⚠️ **Privacy note**: Ente does not provide anonymity. What we provide is privacy through end-to-end encryption. [Information we collect](https://ente.io/privacy/#3-what-information-do-we-collect) about you might make your identity deducible. We accept crypto to make Ente more accessible, not to provide anonymity.
+
+**Processing time:**
+- Invoice generation: 1-2 business days
+- Payment confirmation: Depends on blockchain confirmation times (varies by cryptocurrency)
+
+For questions about crypto payments, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io).
+
+### Does Ente store my card details? {#card-security}
+
+Ente does not store any of your sensitive payment related information.
+
+We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle our card payments, and all of your payment information is sent directly to Stripe's PCI DSS validated servers.
+
+Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to [PCI Service Provider Level 1](https://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do?companyNameCriteria=stripe). This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.
+
+All of this said, if you would still like to pay without sharing your card details, you can pay using PayPal.
+
+## Managing Your Subscription
+
+### What happens when my subscription expires? {#subscription-expires}
+
+When your subscription expires, you enter a **30-day grace period** before your data is deleted.
+
+**Timeline after expiration:**
+
+**Day 0 (Expiration day):**
+- ✅ Your data remains accessible
+- ✅ You can still view and download your photos
+- ❌ New uploads are blocked
+- 📧 You receive an email notification
+
+**Days 1-30 (Grace period):**
+- ✅ Your data remains accessible and downloadable
+- ❌ New uploads are blocked
+- 📧 You receive multiple reminder emails
+- ✅ You can renew your subscription at any time to restore full access
+- ✅ You can export your data using the desktop app or CLI
+
+**Day 30+ (After grace period):**
+- ❌ All your uploaded data is permanently deleted from our servers
+- ❌ Recovery is not possible after deletion
+- 📧 Final notification email sent
+
+**To avoid losing your data:**
+
+1. **Renew your subscription** before the grace period ends:
+   - All your data will be immediately accessible again
+   - Uploads will resume automatically
+   - No data loss
+
+2. **Export your data** during the grace period:
+   - Use the desktop app's export feature
+   - Or use the [CLI tool](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme) for automated export
+   - Download all photos to your computer or NAS
+   - Learn more in the [Export guide](/photos/migration/export/)
+
+**Can I get my free plan back after subscription expires?**
+
+Yes! If you had data exceeding the free 10 GB limit and your subscription expired:
+- Your data enters the 30-day grace period
+- To restore access to your data on the free plan, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io)
+- We can restore your account to the free plan if you're within the grace period
+- You'll need to delete data to get under the 10 GB limit
+
+**What about subscriptions purchased through App Stores?**
+
+If you purchased through iOS App Store or Google Play Store:
+- Manage your subscription through the respective app store
+- Cancellation policies follow the app store's terms
+- The same 30-day grace period applies after expiration
+
+### What happens when I upgrade my plan? {#upgrade-plan}
+
+Your new plan will go into effect immediately, and you only have to pay the difference. We will adjust your remaining pro-rated balance on the old plan when invoicing you for the new plan.
+
+**How prorating works for upgrades:**
+
+When you upgrade, you receive credit for the unused portion of your current plan, which is applied toward the cost of your new plan.
+
+**Example 1: Mid-year upgrade (yearly plans)**
+
+You're 6 months into a 50 GB yearly plan ($20/year) and upgrade to 200 GB yearly ($48/year):
+
+1. **Unused balance from old plan**: $20 ÷ 2 = $10 (6 months remaining)
+2. **New plan cost**: $48/year
+3. **Amount you pay now**: $48 - $10 = **$38**
+4. **New plan duration**: 1 full year from today
+
+**Example 2: Mid-month upgrade (monthly plans)**
+
+You're 15 days into a 100 GB monthly plan ($2/month) and upgrade to 500 GB monthly ($5/month):
+
+1. **Unused balance from old plan**: $2 × (15/30) = $1 (15 days remaining)
+2. **New plan cost**: $5/month
+3. **Amount you pay now**: $5 - $1 = **$4**
+4. **New plan duration**: 1 full month from today
+
+**Key points:**
+- ✅ Upgrades take effect immediately
+- ✅ You get credit for unused time on your old plan
+- ✅ Your new renewal date starts from the upgrade date
+- ✅ You pay the difference between plans (minus your credit)
+
+### What happens when I downgrade my plan? {#downgrade-plan}
+
+Your new plan will go into effect immediately. Any extra amount you have paid will be credited to your account. This credit will be discounted from your future invoices.
+
+**How prorating works for downgrades:**
+
+When you downgrade, you receive credit for the price difference between what you paid and what you would have paid on the lower plan.
+
+**Example 1: Mid-year downgrade (yearly plans)**
+
+You're 6 months into a 200 GB yearly plan ($48/year) and downgrade to 50 GB yearly ($20/year):
+
+1. **What you paid for old plan**: $48
+2. **What you would have paid for 6 months of new plan**: $20 ÷ 2 = $10
+3. **What you paid for 6 months of old plan**: $48 ÷ 2 = $24
+4. **Credit to your account**: $24 - $10 = **$14**
+5. **When credit is used**: Applied to your next renewal in 6 months
+6. **Next invoice (in 6 months)**: $20 - $14 = **$6**
+
+**Example 2: Mid-month downgrade (monthly plans)**
+
+You're 10 days into a 500 GB monthly plan ($5/month) and downgrade to 100 GB monthly ($2/month):
+
+1. **What you paid for old plan**: $5
+2. **What you would have paid for 10 days of new plan**: $2 × (10/30) = $0.67
+3. **What you paid for 10 days of old plan**: $5 × (10/30) = $1.67
+4. **Credit to your account**: $1.67 - $0.67 = **$1**
+5. **When credit is used**: Applied to your next renewal in 20 days
+6. **Next invoice (in 20 days)**: $2 - $1 = **$1**
+
+**Key points:**
+- ✅ Downgrades take effect immediately
+- ✅ You get credit for overpayment
+- ✅ Credit is automatically applied to future renewals
+- ✅ Your renewal date remains the same
+- ⚠️ Make sure you don't exceed your new storage limit
+
+**Want a refund instead of credit?**
+
+If you prefer to have your credit refunded to your original payment method instead of storing it for future invoices, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) and we'll assist you.
+
+### Can I switch between monthly and yearly plans? {#switch-billing-cycle}
+
+Yes! Switching between monthly and yearly billing works the same as upgrading or downgrading:
+
+**Monthly to yearly:**
+- Treated as an upgrade (yearly plans are better value)
+- You get credit for unused days on your monthly plan
+- Pay the yearly price minus your credit
+- New yearly renewal date starts immediately
+
+**Yearly to monthly:**
+- Treated as a downgrade
+- You get credit for the price difference
+- Credit applied to future monthly renewals
+- Renewal date remains the same
+
+The same prorating calculation applies as described above.
+
+### How can I update my payment method? {#update-payment}
+
+You can view and manage your payment method by clicking on the green subscription card within the Ente app, and selecting the "Manage payment method" button.
+
+You will be able to see all of your previous invoices, with details regarding their payment status. In case of failed payments, you will also have an option to retry those charges.
+
+### How can I cancel my subscription? {#cancel-subscription}
+
+You can cancel your subscription by clicking on the green subscription card within the Ente app, and selecting the "Cancel subscription" button.
+
+After cancellation, you'll have access to your data for 30 days, after which it will be deleted. Make sure to export your photos before the grace period ends if you want to keep them.
+
+## Storage
+
+### How can I earn free storage? {#earn-free-storage}
+
+Use our [referral program](/photos/features/account/referral-program/). When friends sign up using your referral code and subscribe to a paid plan, both you and your friend earn additional free storage.

-

-details, you can pay using PayPal.
-
-## What happens if I exceed my storage limit?
-
-Ente will stop backing up your files and you will receive an email alerting you
-of the same.
-
-Your backed up files will remain accessible for as long as you have an active
-subscription.
-
-## What happens when my subscription expires?
-
-30 days after your subscription expires, all of your uploaded data will be

-
-You will receive an email prompting you to take out all of your backed up data
-before this happens.
-
-## What happens when I upgrade my plan?
-
-Your new plan will go into effect immediately, and you only have to pay the
-difference. We will adjust your remaining pro-rated balance on the old plan when
-invoicing you for the new plan.
-
-For example, if you are half way through the year on the 50 GB yearly plan, and
-upgrade to the 200 GB yearly plan, then
-
-- The new 200 GB yearly plan will go into effect immediately.
-
-- But we will reduce the charges for the first year by subtracting the remaining
-  half year balance of the 50 GB yearly plan that you'd already paid.
-
-The same applies to monthly plans.
-
-## What happens when I downgrade my plan?
-
-Your new plan will go into effect immediately. Any extra amount you have paid
-will be credited to your account. This credit will be discounted from your
-future invoices.
-
-For example, if you are half way through the year on the 200 GB yearly plan, and
-downgrade to the 50 GB yearly plan, then
-
-- The new 50 GB yearly plan will go into effect immediately.
-
-- We will calculate a credit by subtracting half the price of the 50 GB plan
-  from half the price of the 200 GB plan. This will be credited to your account.
-
-- This credited amount will be discounted from your next invoice, which will be
-  due in half a year.
-
-The same applies to monthly plans.
-
-If you prefer to have this credit refunded to your original payment method,
-please contact support@ente.io, and we'll assist you.
-
-## How can I update my payment method?

-You can view and manage your payment method by clicking on the green
-subscription card within the Ente app, and selecting the "Manage payment method"

-## How can I cancel my subscription?
-
-You can cancel your subscription by clicking on the green subscription card
-within the Ente app, and selecting the "Cancel subscription" button.
-
-## Is there an x GB plan?
-
-We have experimented quite a bit and have found it hard to design a single
-structure that fits all needs. Some customers wish for many options, some even
-wish to go to an extreme of dynamic per GB pricing. Other customers wish to keep
-everything simple, some even wish for a single unlimited plan.
-
-To keep things fair, our plans don't increase linearly, and the tiers are such
-that cover the most requested patterns.
-
-In addition, we also offer [family plans](/photos/features/family-plans) so that
-you can gain more value out of a single subscription.
-
-## Is there a forever-free plan?
-
-Yes, we offer 10 GB of storage for free.
-
-## What are the limitations of the free plan?
+---
 
-You cannot share albums, or setup a family while you are on a free plan.

+## Upload Issues
+
+### Why are my large videos failing to upload? {#video-upload-failures}
+
+If large video files (300-700+ MB) are failing to upload or getting stuck, try these solutions:
+
+**Solution 1: Disable machine learning temporarily**
+
+ML processing can cause crashes during large video uploads, especially on mobile devices:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning`, disable "Face recognition" and "Magic search", try uploading the videos again, then re-enable ML after upload completes.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning`, disable ML features, upload the videos, then re-enable ML afterwards.
+
+**Solution 2: Disable video streaming (iOS)**
+
+Video streaming can cause crashes when combined with ML on some devices:
+
+**On iOS:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced`, disable "Video streaming" or "Enable video playback", try uploading again, then re-enable after upload completes.
+
+Learn more about [Video Streaming](/photos/features/utilities/video-streaming).
+
+**Solution 3: Upload from desktop instead of mobile**
+
+Desktop apps handle large video uploads more reliably:
+- More memory available
+- Faster, more stable network connections
+- Better handling of large files
+
+**Solution 4: Split large videos**
+
+If a specific video keeps failing:
+- The file might be corrupted or too large
+- Try uploading other files first to isolate the problem
+- Consider compressing the video if it's extremely large
+- Check if the video is under the 10 GB file size limit
+
+**If uploads are still failing:**
+
+1. Check your network connection is stable
+2. Make sure you're not running out of storage quota
+3. Try uploading via WiFi instead of mobile data
+4. Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) with debug logs (see [How to share logs](#sharing-logs))
+
+### Why does the app crash when watching videos or using ML? {#app-crashes-ml-video}
+
+If the Ente app crashes when watching videos or when machine learning is enabled, especially on iOS or older devices, this is a known issue.
+
+**Quick fix: Disable ML and video streaming**
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced`, disable "Machine learning" and "Video streaming" (or "Enable video playback"), then restart the app.
+
+Learn more about [Video Streaming](/photos/features/utilities/video-streaming#troubleshooting).
+
+**Why this happens:**
+
+The combination of ML processing and video streaming can exceed available device memory on:
+- Older iPhone/iPad models
+- Devices with limited RAM
+- When processing very large libraries
+
+**If you want to use ML:**
+
+1. Enable ML on desktop first (more powerful hardware)
+2. Let indexing complete on desktop
+3. Indexes sync to your mobile device
+4. You can then use search on mobile without enabling ML there
+5. Keep video streaming disabled on mobile
+
+**Reporting crashes:**
+
+If you continue experiencing crashes, go to `Settings > Support > Report a Bug` (this attaches crash logs automatically). Mention your device model and iOS/Android version, and describe when the crashes occur.
+
+### Why aren't my photos uploading? {#upload-failures}
+
+If your photos or videos aren't uploading to Ente, try these troubleshooting steps:
+
+**Check network connectivity:**
+- Verify your internet connection is stable and working
+- Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
+- If using a VPN, try disabling it or switching to a different provider
+- Check if your firewall or network security settings are blocking Ente
+
+**Check storage quota:**
+- Check your storage quota in the app
+- If you've exceeded your limit, [upgrade your plan](/photos/faq/storage-and-plans#what-plans-does-ente-offer) or delete unwanted photos
+- Items in trash count towards your quota - empty trash to free up space
+
+**Check file compatibility:**
+- Ente supports all `image/*` and `video/*` file types
+- RAW format support is currently limited
+- Files larger than 10 GB cannot be uploaded
+- If a valid file isn't uploading, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io)
+
+### Why does upload show "Waiting to upload"? {#waiting-to-upload}
+
+This usually indicates a network connectivity issue:
+
+1. Check your internet connection is active
+2. Try switching networks (WiFi to mobile data or vice versa)
+3. If using VPN, try disabling it temporarily
+4. Check if your firewall is blocking Ente's servers
+5. On desktop/web, try disabling "Faster uploads" in `Settings > Preferences > Advanced`
+
+### Why are uploads failing on desktop or web? {#faster-uploads}
+
+We use a Cloudflare proxy to speed up uploads ([blog post](https://ente.io/blog/tech/making-uploads-faster/)). However, in some network configurations (depending on your ISP) this might prevent uploads from going through.
+
+**Solution:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Advanced` (desktop/web), disable the "Faster uploads" option, and try uploading again.
+
+If uploads still fail after disabling this option, check your network connectivity and firewall settings.
+
+### Why can't the app detect certain file types? {#file-type-detection}
+
+The desktop/web app tries to detect if a particular file is a video or image. If the detection fails, the app skips the upload.
+
+**Solution:** Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) if you find that a valid image or video file was not detected and uploaded. Include:
+- The file extension (e.g., .jpg, .mp4)
+- The file's MIME type if you know it
+- A sample file if possible
+
+## Mobile Backup Issues
+
+### Why isn't background sync working on my phone? {#background-sync-issues}
+
+**On Android:**
+
+1. **Disable battery optimization for Ente:**
+   - Open device `Settings > Apps > Ente > Battery`
+   - Select "Unrestricted" or "Don't optimize"
+
+2. **Check storage permissions:**
+   - Open device `Settings > Apps > Ente > Permissions`
+   - Ensure "Photos and videos" or "Files and media" is allowed
+
+3. **Verify backed up folders:**
+   - Open Ente app, go to `Settings > Backup > Backed up folders`
+   - Ensure the correct albums/folders are selected
+
+**On iOS:**
+
+1. **Check Background App Refresh:**
+   - Open device `Settings > Ente > Background App Refresh`
+   - Ensure it's enabled
+
+2. **Keep app in foreground for initial upload:**
+   - For large libraries, keep Ente open during the first upload
+   - Once initial upload completes, background sync will work automatically
+
+Learn more in [Backup and Sync FAQ](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#background-sync).
+
+### Why can't Ente access my photos? {#photo-access-permissions}
+
+**On iOS:**
+
+Open device `Settings > Ente > Photos` and select "Full Access" (not "Selected Photos").
+
+**On Android:**
+
+Open device `Settings > Apps > Ente > Permissions`, enable "Photos and videos" or "Files and media", and ensure permission is set to "Allow" (not "Ask every time").
+
+If you've granted permission but Ente still can't access photos, try:
+- Restarting the app
+- Revoking and re-granting the permission
+- Reinstalling the app (your backed-up photos are safe in the cloud)
+
+## Desktop App Issues
+
+### Why does my desktop app crash during large uploads? {#desktop-large-uploads}
+
+If you're uploading a very large library (multiple terabytes) and the desktop app seems to freeze or restart during upload, especially when uploading large videos, this is related to Electron's 4GB RAM usage limit.
+
+**Workarounds:**
+
+1. **Separate large videos**: Put problematic large videos in a separate folder, complete the rest of your upload, then upload that folder separately
+
+2. **Use drag and drop**: Instead of using watch folders or uploading a zip, drag and drop the folder directly into the app. This works better because the app has direct access to files via browser APIs
+
+3. **Upload in batches**: Split your library into smaller chunks and upload them separately
+
+The app will detect and skip already uploaded items, so you can safely drag and drop the same folder multiple times.
+
+> Technical note: The underlying issue is Electron's [4GB RAM usage limit](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage). We stream large videos to avoid reading them all at once, but in some cases even streaming exceeds the limit.
+
+### Why are my photo thumbnails missing or incorrect? {#thumbnails}
+
+If thumbnails aren't generating properly, the most common cause is browser security settings blocking canvas access.
+
+**Firefox users:** If you have "block canvas fingerprinting" enabled (`privacy.resistFingerprinting` set to true in `about:config`), Firefox will prevent the app from generating thumbnails.
+
+**Solution:**
+- Disable canvas fingerprinting for Ente's domain, OR
+- Check if you're using browser extensions that block canvas access and whitelist Ente
+
+**Important:** Once thumbnails are incorrectly generated or missing, they cannot be regenerated. You'll need to:
+1. Delete the affected files from Ente
+2. Fix the browser settings
+3. Re-upload the files
+
+Ente will automatically skip files that have already been uploaded, so you can drag and drop the original folder again after removing the files without thumbnails.
+
+### Why aren't my watch folders syncing? {#watch-folders-troubleshooting}
+
+If watch folders aren't uploading new files automatically:
+
+1. **Check the watch folders list:**
+   - Click "Watch folders" in the sidebar
+   - Verify the correct folders are being watched
+
+2. **Check upload status:**
+   - Look for the sync status indicator in the bottom right
+   - Expand it to see any errors
+
+3. **Restart the desktop app**
+
+4. **If the issue persists:**
+   - Remove the watch folder
+   - Re-add it
+   - Ente will skip already uploaded files
+
+Learn more in [Backup and Sync FAQ](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#watch-folders).
+
+### Can I upload from a network drive (NAS)? {#nas}
+
+**Not recommended.** While the desktop app may work with network drives in some cases, network storage often has:
+- Flaky file system emulation causing upload issues
+- Poor performance during large uploads
+- Unreliable file change notifications (critical for watch folders)
+
+**Recommended approach:** Temporarily copy files to local storage before uploading rather than uploading directly from network drives.
+
+**Exception:** Exporting to network drives generally works better than importing. If exporting to a UNC path (Windows network path like `\\server\share`), map it to a network drive letter first.
+
+### Can I safely close the desktop app while it's uploading? {#close-during-upload}
+
+Yes! The desktop app supports resumable uploads. You can close the app at any time, and when you open it again, it will automatically resume from where it left off. Your progress is saved and no files will be uploaded twice.
+
+## Platform-Specific Issues
+
+### Why is my iOS app stuck on "Please wait..." when I purchase a subscription? {#ios-appstore-subscription}
+
+If you purchased a subscription through the iOS App Store but the app shows "Please wait..." indefinitely or doesn't reflect your upgraded storage, this is a known issue with App Store subscription processing.
+
+**Recommended solution:**
+1. Request a refund from Apple for the App Store purchase
+2. Purchase your subscription directly from [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io) instead
+
+**How to request a refund from Apple:**
+1. Go to [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com)
+2. Sign in with your Apple ID
+3. Find the Ente subscription purchase
+4. Select "Request a refund"
+5. Choose "It's not working as expected" as the reason
+
+**Alternative workaround to try first:**
+1. Force close the Ente app completely
+2. Update to the latest version from the App Store
+3. Reopen the app and wait a few minutes
+4. If still stuck, proceed with the refund and web purchase
+
+**Why purchase from web.ente.io?**
+- More reliable payment processing
+- Can apply discount codes (not possible through App Store)
+- Avoid App Store's 30% fee
+- Better refund and support options
+
+If you continue experiencing issues after purchasing from the web, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io).
+
+### Why is my Android app stuck on the splash screen? {#android-splash-freeze}
+
+If the Ente app freezes at the splash screen for 15+ seconds on Android, try these solutions in order:
+
+**Solution 1: Clear app cache**
+
+Open device `Settings > Apps > Ente > Storage` and tap "Clear cache" (NOT "Clear data" - this preserves your login), then reopen the app.
+
+**Solution 2: Log out and log back in**
+1. If you can access Settings in the app, log out
+2. Log back in with your email and password
+3. This refreshes the app state
+
+**Solution 3: Reinstall the app**
+1. Uninstall Ente from your device
+2. Reinstall from your preferred source (Play Store, F-Droid, GitHub)
+3. Log back in
+4. Your backed-up photos are safe in the cloud
+
+**Note**: This is a known issue being investigated by our team. If none of these solutions work, please contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) with your device model and Android version.
+
+### Why is the Linux desktop app still showing the old icon after updating? {#linux-icon-update}
+
+You might need to update the icon cache of your Linux desktop environment.
+
+**Solutions:**
+1. Restart your computer (or logout and login again)
+2. Refresh the icon cache manually (steps vary by distro):
+   - Example: `xdg-desktop-menu forceupdate`
+
+**AppImage users:** If you're using an AppImage and not seeing the icon, you'll need to enable AppImage desktop integration (see below).
+
+### How do I enable AppImage desktop integration on Linux? {#appimage-integration}
+
+AppImages are not fully standalone and require additional steps to enable full "desktop integration":
+- Showing the app icon
+- Surfacing the app in the list of installed apps
+- Handling redirection after passkey verification
+
+**Solution:**
+1. Download [appimaged](https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage/releases) AppImage
+2. Run the appimaged AppImage
+3. Download the Ente Photos AppImage into your `~/Downloads` folder
+4. appimaged will automatically pick it up and integrate it
+
+See the [AppImage documentation](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#integrating-appimages-into-the-desktop) for all integration methods.
+
+### Why doesn't the AppImage work on my ARM64 Linux machine? {#appimage-arm64}
+
+If the AppImage doesn't do anything when you run it on ARM64 Linux, you need to create a symlink:
+
+```sh
+sudo ln -s /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libz.so{.1,}
+```
+
+This creates `libz.so` as an alias for `libz.so.1`. The exact path might differ on your machine.
+
+### Why does AppImage say it requires FUSE? {#appimage-fuse}
+
+**Solution:**
+Install libfuse2. For example, on Ubuntu:
+
+```sh
+sudo apt install libfuse2
+```
+
+See the [AppImage FUSE documentation](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html#the-appimage-tells-me-it-needs-fuse-to-run) for more details.
+
+### Why do I get a "SUID sandbox helper" error on Linux? {#suid-sandbox-error}
+
+If you run the AppImage from the command line and see:
+> The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.
+
+**Solution:**
+Either:
+1. Double-click the AppImage in your file browser instead of running from CLI, OR
+2. Run it with the `--no-sandbox` flag:
+   ```sh
+   ./ente.AppImage --no-sandbox
+   ```
+
+### Why won't the Windows desktop app start (JavaScript error)? {#windows-javascript-error}
+
+If you see "A JavaScript error occurred in the main process - The specified module could not be found" when starting the app on Windows, you need to install the Microsoft VC++ runtime.
+
+**Solution:**
+Install the [Microsoft VC++ redistributable runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version).
+
+### Why can't I log in to web.ente.io on my mobile browser? {#web-login-mobile}
+
+If web.ente.io loads infinitely or gets stuck when you try to log in on a mobile browser (Safari on iPhone, Chrome on Android), this is a known limitation.
+
+**Why this happens:**
+
+Mobile browsers cannot handle the computationally intensive password derivation process that Ente uses for security. The login process requires significant processing power and memory that mobile browsers don't provide.
+
+**Solutions:**
+
+1. **Use the native mobile app instead** (recommended):
+   - Install Ente Photos from the [App Store (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1542026904) or [Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ente.photos)
+   - Mobile apps are optimized for phones and tablets
+   - Full feature support including machine learning
+
+2. **Use a desktop or laptop computer**:
+   - web.ente.io works on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
+   - Or install the [desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop)
+
+**Feature differences:**
+
+Mobile browsers on web.ente.io are not supported. Use native apps for the best experience:
+- ✅ Mobile apps: Full features including ML, search, video streaming
+- ✅ Desktop/laptop web: Most features (no ML)
+- ❌ Mobile web browsers: Not supported
+
+### How do I identify which files failed to upload? {#identify-failed-uploads}
+
+**On desktop:**
+Check the sections within the upload progress bar for:
+- "Failed Uploads"
+- "Ignored Uploads"
+- "Unsuccessful Uploads"
+
+Click on each section to see the specific files and error messages.
+
+**On mobile:**
+Open `Settings > Backup` to see the backup status and any errors.
+
+## Performance Issues
+
+### Why is the app slow to load my photos? {#app-slow-loading}
+
+**Check your internet connection:**
+- Slow loading usually indicates network issues
+- Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
+- VPNs can sometimes slow down loading
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Ensure background sync is enabled (see [Background sync troubleshooting](#background-sync-not-working))
+- Check if battery optimization is restricting the app
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Large libraries may take time to load initially
+- Once loaded, the app caches data for faster access
+
+### Why is face recognition or magic search taking so long? {#ml-slow}
+
+Machine learning features (face recognition and magic search) require downloading and indexing your entire library on your device. This can take time depending on:
+- Library size
+- Device processing power
+- Network speed
+
+**Tips for faster indexing:**
+- Enable ML on desktop first (faster processor)
+- Use WiFi for initial indexing
+- Keep the app open and in the foreground
+- Once indexed on one device, the indexes sync to other devices
+
+Learn more in [Search and Discovery FAQ](/photos/faq/search-and-discovery#ml-offline).
+

-
-### What happens when I enable video streaming?
-
-#### On mobile
-
-Enabling video streaming will start processing videos captured in the last 30
-days, generating streams for each. Both local and remote videos will be
-processed, so this may consume bandwidth for downloading of remote files and
-uploading of the generated streams.
-
-#### On desktop
-
-When enabled, the desktop app will generate streams both for new uploads, and
-also for all existing videos that were previously uploaded.
-
-Stream generation is CPU intensive and can take time so the app will continue
-processing them in the background. Clicking on search bar will show "Processing
-videos..." when stream generation is happening.
-
-### How can I view video streams?
-
-### On mobile
-
-Settings -> Backup > Backup status will show details regarding the processing
-status for videos. Processed videos will have a green play button next to them.
-You can open these videos by tapping on them.
-
-Processed videos will show a `Play stream` button, clicking which will load and
-play the stream.
-
-Clicking on the `Info` icon within the original video will show details about
-the generated stream.
-
-### On desktop and web
-
-Desktop and web app will automatically play the streaming version of a video if
-it has already been generated. The quality selector will show "Auto" when
-playing the stream.
-
-### What is a stream?
-
-Stream is an encrypted HLS file with an `.m3u8` playlist that helps play a video
-with support for seeking **without** downloading the full file.
-
-Currently it converts videos into `720p` with `2mbps` bitrate in `H.264` format.
-The generated stream is a single blob (encrypted with AES) while the playlist file
-(`.m3u8`) is another blob (encrypted using XChaCha20).
-
-We cannot read the contents, duration or the number of chunks within the
-generated stream.
-
-### Will streams consume space in my storage?
-
-While this feature is in beta, we will not count the storage consumed by your
-streams against your storage quota. This may change in the future. If it does,
-we will provide an option to opt-in to one of the following:
-
-1. Original videos only
-2. Compressed streams only
-3. Both
-
-### Something doesn't seem right, what to do?
+---
 
-As video streaming is still in beta, some things might not work correctly.
-Please create a thread within the `#feedback` channel on

+title: Family plans
+description:
+    Share your Ente Photos plan with your family members with no extra cost
+---
+
+# Family plans
+
+Paid subscribers of Ente can share the storage with their family, **at no
+additional cost** as you have already paid for the storage.
+
+In brief,
+
+- Your family members can use storage space from your plan without paying extra.
+
+- Ask them to sign up for Ente, and then just add them to your existing plan
+  using the "Manage family" option within your Subscription settings.
+
+- Each member gets their own private space, and cannot see each other's files
+  unless they're shared.
+
+- You can invite 5 family members. So including yourself, it will be 6 people
+  who can share a single subscription, paying only once.
+
+## Storage Limits
+
+If you're an admin of a family, you will be able to set storage limits for the
+members in your family plan.
+
+In brief,
+
+- For example, once you set a limit of 10GB for a member, their Storage quota
+  for uploading photos will be limited to 10GB.
+
+- Once the invited member accepts the Family invite, you will be able to see an
+  edit icon in the Members List. Click on it to setup a family limit.
+
+- If the admin has set a limit for any user, that limit value will be prefilled
+  in the input box.
+
+- If you want to remove any storage limit from a members account, you can click
+  on the "Remove Limit" and they can upload photos without any limit.

+title: Account
+description: Overview of Ente account features, security, and subscription management
+---
+
+# Account
+
+Your Ente account is the foundation for securely storing and accessing your photos across all your devices. This page provides an overview of account management, security features, and subscription options.
+
+## Using Ente accounts across products
+
+Your Ente account works across both Ente Photos and Ente Auth. You can use the same account for both products, or create separate accounts for each.
+
+> **Note**: If you use the same account for both Photos and Auth and enable 2FA for your Ente account (stored in Ente Auth), this creates a circular dependency. We recommend either:
+> - Using separate accounts for Auth and Photos for security
+> - Ensuring your recovery key is stored securely (written down on paper) as it can bypass 2FA if you're locked out
+> - Using [Passkeys](/photos/features/account/passkeys) or [Legacy](/photos/features/account/legacy/) as additional recovery options
+>
+> Learn more about this scenario in the [Enteception guide](/auth/faq/enteception/).
+
+## Account Creation
+
+Creating an Ente account involves four steps:
+
+1. **Enter and verify your email address** - Used for login and sharing with others
+2. **Create a strong password** - The foundation of your end-to-end encryption
+3. **Save your recovery key** - The only way to recover your account if you forget your password
+4. **Choose a plan** - Start with 10 GB free or select a paid plan
+
+Learn more in the [Creating an account guide](/photos/getting-started/signup).
+
+## Security
+
+### Password and encryption
+
+Your password is used to encrypt all your photos before they're uploaded to Ente's servers. Only you know your password, which means only you can decrypt and view your files.
+
+**Important security practices:**
+- Use a strong, unique password
+- Never share your password with anyone
+- Store your password in a password manager
+
+You can change your password at any time in Settings without re-encrypting your entire library.
+
+### Recovery key
+
+Your **recovery key is a 24-word phrase** that is the only way to recover your account if you:
+- Forget your password AND
+- Are logged out of all devices
+
+**How to save it:**
+- Write it down on paper and store it securely
+- Save it in a password manager
+- Store it in any secure location you trust
+
+Without your recovery key, losing your password means permanently losing access to your photos.
+
+Learn more in the [Account Creation FAQ](/photos/faq/account-creation#recovery-key).
+
+### Two-factor authentication (2FA)
+
+Ente supports multiple 2FA methods for additional security:
+- **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
+- **WebAuthn/FIDO2** for hardware security keys
+- **Passkeys** as an alternative 2FA mechanism
+
+Enable 2FA in `Settings > Security` on mobile or desktop apps.
+
+Learn more about [Passkeys](/photos/features/account/passkeys).
+
+### End-to-end encryption
+
+Ente uses end-to-end encryption, which means:
+- Files are encrypted on your device before upload
+- Ente's servers store only encrypted data
+- Only you have the keys to decrypt your files
+- Even Ente cannot access your photos

+
+## Storage Management
+
+### How storage is calculated
+
+Ente calculates storage using GibiBytes (GiB):
+- Divides total bytes by `1024 x 1024 x 1024` (not `1000 x 1000 x 1000`)
+- This means files appear to use less storage compared to providers using GB
+- We display it as "GB" without the "i" for simplicity
+
+### Automatic deduplication
+
+Ente automatically detects and handles duplicates:
+- Skips identical files uploaded to the same album
+- Creates symlinks for files in multiple albums (storage counted only once)
+- Works across all your albums automatically
+- No manual action required
+
+Learn more in the [Duplicate detection guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).
+
+### Storage optimization
+
+Free up space with built-in tools:
+- **Free up device space** - Remove backed-up photos from your phone
+- **Remove exact duplicates** - Find and delete duplicate files
+- **Remove similar images** - Use ML to find visually similar photos
+
+Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).
+
+## Referral Program
+
+Earn free storage by inviting friends:
+- Share your referral code from `Settings > General > Referrals`
+- When friends upgrade to a paid plan, both of you get **10 GB free**
+- Maximum earned storage equals your plan size (double your storage)
+- Earned storage lasts as long as your subscription is active
+
+Learn more in the [Referral program guide](/photos/features/account/referral-program/).
+
+## Account Recovery and Legacy
+
+### Recovery options
+
+If you lose access to your account:
+- Use a logged-in device to reset your password
+- Use your recovery key if logged out of all devices
+- Contact support if you lose access to your email
+
+### Legacy (Trusted Contacts)
+
+Ente offers a legacy feature that allows you to designate trusted contacts who can access your account if something happens to you.
+
+Learn more in the [Legacy guide](/photos/features/account/legacy/).

+title: Legacy
+description: Using Legacy to pass on your memories to loved ones
+---
+
+# Legacy
+
+Legacy allows trusted contacts to recover your account in your absence. The main
+usecase here is to pass on your memories after your death. It can also be useful
+for other cases - for e.g., when you forget your password and recovery key.
+
+Trusted Contacts can initiate a recovery, and if not blocked in 30 days, would
+be able to change the password to your account and thereby access your memories.
+
+## Adding a trusted contact
+
+You can add a trusted contact for your account using the mobile app for Ente
+Photos. Open `Settings > Account > Legacy`, and click on "Add Trusted Contact".
+
+You would be asked to enter the email address of the trusted contact you want to
+add or choose from a list of contacts on Ente. Please note that the trusted
+contact must be an Ente user.
+
+<div align="center">
+
+![Add Trusted Contact](add_trusted_contact.png){width=300px}
+
+</div>
+
+The trusted contact must accept your request. They can do so by going to
+Settings -> Account -> Legacy in the Ente Photos mobile app, and clicking on
+your email address within the Legacy accounts sections. Ente would also send an
+email notification to the trusted contact to nudge them to accept the invite.
+
+<div align="center">
+
+![Accept Trusted Contact Invite](accept_trusted_contact_invite.png){width=300px}
+
+</div>
+
+## Recovering an account as a trusted contact
+
+As a trusted contact, you can recover an account by going to Settings -> Account
+-> Legacy in the Ente photos app, tapping on the email address of the account
+within the Legacy account sections.
+
+<div align="center">
+
+![Initiate Account Recovery](initiate_account_recovery.png){width=300px}
+
+</div>
+
+Once the recovery is initiated, the account owner would get 30 days to block the
+recovery. After 30 days, you can go the same page in the app, where you will be
+prompted to change the password of the account. Once you change the password,
+you would be able to access the recovered account with the new password.
+
+## Blocking account recovery by a trusted contact
+
+After a trusted contact initiates a recover, you, as the account owner, would
+get 30 days to block the recovery. To do this, you must go to `Settings >
+Account > Legacy`, where you will see a message that recovery of the account has
+been initiated. Tapping on that will allow you to block the recovery.
+
+## Removing a trusted contact
+
+You can remove a trusted contact by going to `Settings > Account > Legacy`,
+tapping on the trusted contact you want to remove, and choosing "Remove" in the
+popup.

+title: Passkeys
+description: Using passkeys as a second factor for your Ente account
+---
+
+# Passkeys
+
+Passkeys are a new authentication mechanism that uses strong cryptography built
+into devices, like Windows Hello or Apple's Touch ID. **You can use passkeys as
+a second factor to secure your Ente account.**
+
+> [!TIP]
+>
+> Passkeys are the colloquial term for a WebAuthn (Web Authentication)
+> credentials.
+>
+> - More details about why and how are in the Passkeys announcement
+>   [blog post](https://ente.io/blog/introducing-passkeys-on-ente/).
+> - And to know more technical details about how our passkey verification works,
+>   you can see this
+>   [technical note in our source code](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/web/docs/webauthn-passkeys.md).
+
+## Passkeys and TOTP
+
+Ente already supports TOTP codes (in fact, we built an
+[entire app](https://ente.io/auth/) to store them...). Passkeys serve as an
+alternative 2FA (second factor) mechanism.
+
+If you add a passkey to your Ente account, it will be used instead of any
+existing 2FA codes that you have configured (if any).
+
+## Enabling and disabling passkeys
+
+Passkeys get enabled if you add one (or more) passkeys to your account.
+Conversely, passkeys get disabled if you remove all your existing passkeys.
+
+To add and remove passkeys, use the _Passkey_ option in the settings menu. This
+will open up _accounts.ente.io_, where you can manage your passkeys.
+
+## Login with passkeys
+
+If passkeys are enabled, then _accounts.ente.io_ will automatically open when
+you log into your Ente account on a new device. Here you can follow the
+instructions given by the browser to verify your passkey.
+
+> These instructions different for each browser and device, but generally they
+> will ask you to use the same mechanism that you used when you created the
+> passkey to verify it (scanning a QR code, using your fingerprint, pressing the
+> key on your Yubikey or other security key hardware etc).
+
+## Recovery
+
+If you are unable to login with your passkey (e.g. if you have misplaced the
+hardware key that you used to store your passkey), then you can **recover your
+account by using your Ente recovery key**.
+
+During login, press cancel on the browser dialog to verify your passkey, and
+then select the "Recover two-factor" option in the error message that gets
+shown. This will take you to a place where you can enter your Ente recovery key
+and login into your account. Now you can go to the _Passkey_ page to delete the
+lost passkey and/or add a new one.
+
+If you have lost access to both your passkey and recovery key, please reach out
+to [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) for help.

+title: Albums
+description: Using albums in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Albums
+
+Albums in Ente are collections that help you organize your photos and videos. Similar to folders on your computer, albums group related photos together - but with some key differences:
+
+**How albums work:**
+- Albums are collections of photos and videos
+- Each photo can belong to multiple albums simultaneously
+- When you add a photo to multiple albums, it only counts once toward your storage
+- Albums sync across all your devices automatically
+
+**Key differences from folders:**
+- **No nesting**: Unlike folders, albums cannot contain other albums - they're all at the same level
+- **Multiple membership**: A single photo can exist in many albums without using extra storage
+- **Device-independent**: Albums you create in Ente are separate from folders on your device
+
+You can create albums by uploading photos from your device, manually adding photos to new albums, or automatically through features like [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) on desktop.
+
+## Rename album
+
+Personalize your albums by giving them a meaningful name.
+
+### On mobile
+
+- Open the album
+- Tap the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Tap **Rename album**, then type in a new name
+- Tap **Rename**
+
+### On web / desktop
+
+- Open the album
+- Click the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Click **Rename album**
+- Type in a new name
+- Click **Rename** or press Enter
+
+## Set album cover
+
+Select any photo you want to use as the cover for your album.
+
+### On mobile
+
+- Open the album you want to change
+- Tap the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Select **Set cover**
+- A new screen will appear, prompting you to select the cover photo
+- Browse through your photos and tap on the image you want to set as the album cover
+- Tap **Use selected photo**
+
+## View album photos on a map
+
+Explore your album's memories based on their location.
+
+- Open the album
+- Tap the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Select **Map**
+- All photos from the album will appear in map view
+
+Learn more about [Map and location](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/map-and-location) features.
+
+## Sort albums
+
+Maintain order in your albums by arranging them from newest to oldest.
+
+### On mobile
+
+- Open the album
+- Tap the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Select **Sort by**
+- Choose **Newest first** or **Oldest first**
+
+### On web / desktop
+
+- Open the album
+- Click the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Click **Sort by**
+- Select **Newest first** or **Oldest first**
+
+## Pin albums
+
+Keep your favorite albums at the top by pinning them for quick access.
+
+### On mobile
+
+- Open the album
+- Tap the overflow menu (three dots) in the top right corner
+- Tap **Pin album** or **Unpin album**
+
+## Uploading nested folders from desktop {#preserving-folder-structure}
+
+When you upload photos and videos from your computer using the desktop app - whether by dragging and dropping a folder or zip file, or by setting up [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) - you can choose how to handle nested folder structures.
+
+### Single files or flat folders
+
+If you upload individual files or a folder without nested subfolders, the desktop app will ask you to either:
+- Upload to an existing Ente album, or
+- Create a new album
+
+The app will intelligently suggest a name for the new album based on the folder name.
+
+### Nested folder structures
+
+If the folder contains nested subfolders and you choose to create a new album, you'll see two options:
+
+**Single album:**
+- Creates one Ente album named after the parent folder
+- All files from all nested subfolders go into this single album
+- Example: Folder `Photos` containing `New Year/` and `Summer/` → One album called "Photos" with all files
+
+**Separate albums:**
+- Creates a separate Ente album for each nested subfolder
+- Only folders containing at least one file become albums (empty folders are ignored)
+- Only the leaf folder name is used (e.g., both `A/B/C/Photos/x.jpg` and `1/2/3/Photos/y.jpg` go to an album called "Photos")
+- Example: Folder `Photos` containing `New Year/` and `Summer/` → Two albums: "New Year" and "Summer"
+
+> **Note**: Ente albums cannot be nested. In separate album mode, each nested folder becomes a top-level album - they won't be organized in a hierarchy.
+
+Learn more about [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) for automatic desktop syncing.

+title: Deleting Photos
+description: How to delete photos, manage trash, and permanently remove files in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Deleting Photos
+
+Ente uses a two-stage deletion system to protect against accidental data loss. When you delete a photo or video, it first moves to Trash where it stays for 30 days before being permanently deleted. This gives you time to recover accidentally deleted items.
+
+## How Deletion Works
+
+When you delete a photo in Ente:
+
+1. **Photo moves to Trash** - The file is immediately removed from your albums and moved to a special Trash folder
+2. **30-day retention** - The file remains in Trash for 30 days, giving you time to restore it
+3. **Automatic permanent deletion** - After 30 days, the file is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered
+4. **Manual permanent deletion** - You can also manually empty trash or delete specific items at any time
+
+**Important**: Items in Trash count toward your storage quota until permanently deleted.
+
+## Deleting Photos
+
+### On mobile
+
+1. Long press to select the photo(s) you want to delete
+2. Tap the trash icon in the action bar
+3. Confirm the deletion
+
+The selected photos will be moved to Trash.
+
+### On web/desktop
+
+1. Select the photo(s) you want to delete
+2. Click the trash icon or press the Delete key
+3. Confirm the deletion
+
+The selected photos will be moved to Trash.
+
+### Bulk deletion
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Long press the first photo to enter selection mode
+- Tap additional photos to select them
+- Tap "Select all" to select all visible photos
+- Tap the trash icon and confirm
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Click the first photo
+- Hold Shift and click the last photo to select a range
+- Or use Ctrl/Cmd+A to select all photos
+- Press Delete key or click the trash icon and confirm
+
+All selected photos will be moved to Trash together.
+
+## The Trash Folder
+
+### What is Trash?
+
+Trash is a special folder where deleted photos are held temporarily before permanent deletion. Think of it as a "recycle bin" for your photos.
+
+**Trash characteristics:**
+- Photos remain for 30 days before automatic permanent deletion
+- Photos are hidden from normal views (galleries, search, albums)
+- Photos still count against your storage quota
+- You can restore photos anytime within the 30-day window
+- You can manually empty trash to free up storage immediately
+
+### Accessing Trash
+
+**On mobile:**

+**On mobile and web/desktop:**
+1. Open Trash
+2. Select the items you want to permanently delete
+3. Choose "Delete permanently" from the menu
+4. Confirm the action
+
+Only the selected items will be permanently deleted.
+
+## Special Deletion Scenarios
+
+### Deleting albums
+
+When you delete an album in Ente, you'll be given two options:
+
+**Option 1: Delete album and keep photos**
+- The album is removed from your library
+- Photos that were exclusively in that album are moved to [Uncategorized](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/uncategorized)
+- Photos that exist in other albums remain in those albums
+
+**Option 2: Delete album and photos**
+- Both the album and all photos in it are moved to Trash
+- Photos will be permanently deleted after 30 days unless restored
+
+Choose carefully based on whether you want to keep the photos or remove them entirely.
+
+### Deleting from collaborative albums
+
+In collaborative albums, deletion permissions vary:
+
+**If you're a collaborator:**
+- You can only delete photos that you uploaded
+- When you delete your photo, it goes to your trash
+- You cannot delete photos uploaded by other collaborators
+
+**If you're the album owner:**
+- You can remove any photos from the album
+- You can only permanently delete photos you own
+- Other collaborators' photos will be removed from the album but remain in their accounts
+
+**When someone leaves:**
+When a collaborator leaves or is removed from a shared album, any photos they uploaded are also removed from that album (but remain in their personal library).
+
+### Shared photos
+
+You cannot permanently delete photos that someone else owns and shared with you. Only the owner of a photo can permanently delete it from Ente.
+
+If someone has shared an album with you and you want to stop seeing it:
+- Leave the shared album, OR
+- Archive the shared album to hide it from your main view
+
+Learn more about [Sharing and collaboration](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/share).
+
+### Device deletion does not sync
+
+**Important**: If you delete a photo from your device's native photos app (iOS Photos, Google Photos, etc.), it will **not** be automatically deleted from Ente.
+
+This is by design for two reasons:
+
+1. **Safety**: Prevents accidental loss of your backed-up photos
+2. **Platform restrictions**: iOS and Android don't allow apps to automatically delete users' photos without manual confirmation
+
+If you want to delete a photo from Ente, you must do it manually within the Ente app.
+
+### Watch folder deletion
+
+On desktop, if you delete a file from a [watched folder](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders), the corresponding photo in Ente is moved to [Uncategorized](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/uncategorized), not Trash.
+
+This prevents accidental deletion when reorganizing files on your computer. If you want to delete the photo from Ente, you must delete it from within the Ente app.

+
+# Hiding photos and albums
+
+You can further protect sensitive photos or albums by hiding them. Hidden photos or albums are **only viewable** after an extra layer of authentication inside the app.
+
+Hiding differs from [Archiving](./archive) in that hidden content won't appear anywhere in the app without explicit authentication, whereas archiving only removes items from the home timeline and memories sections.
+
+- Hidden photos and albums will be removed from home timelines, memories, albums
+  tab, search results, and any other visible place in the app.
+
+- Hidden photos will be removed from all regular albums. If you want to unhide
+  again you will have to specify the album to move it to.
+
+- You cannot hide photos or albums shared with you. You can archive shared
+  albums instead.
+
+## How to
+
+### Hide album
+
+- Open the album
+- Click the overflow menu (three dots)
+- Select **Hide album**
+
+### Hide photo
+
+- Select the photo
+- Tap/click **Hide** from the selection menu
+
+### View hidden photos and albums
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Go to the Albums tab
+- Scroll to the bottom
+- Tap **Hidden**
+- Authenticate with biometrics or passcode
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Click the menu icon (three horizontal lines) at top left
+- Select **Hidden**
+- Authenticate with your Ente password
+
+### Unhide album
+
+- Open the hidden album
+- Click the overflow menu (three dots)
+- Select **Unhide album**
+
+### Unhide photo
+
+- Select the hidden photo
+- Tap/click **Unhide** from the selection menu
+- Select the album to restore the photo to
+
+## Metadata Privacy
+
+Ente has no information about whether you have hidden a photo or album.

+title: Storage optimization
+description: Tools to optimize your storage usage in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Storage optimization
+
+Ente provides several tools to help you optimize your storage usage - both on your devices and in your Ente cloud storage. These are manual tools you can use to clean up and manage your photo library after backup.
+
+## Free up device space
+
+Once your photos are safely backed up to Ente, you can free up storage space on your phone by removing local copies. Your photos remain accessible in Ente and can be downloaded anytime you need them.
+
+### How to free up space
+
+**On mobile (iOS and Android):**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Free up space > Free up device space`, review how much space will be freed, and confirm to delete backed-up photos from your device.
+
+
+<div align="center">
+
+![Free up space screen](free-up-space.png){width=400px}
+
+</div>
+
+The app will delete all photos and videos that have been successfully backed up to Ente, leaving only photos that haven't been backed up yet.
+
+### Important notes
+
+**After freeing up space:**
+- Your photos remain in Ente and can be viewed anytime
+- Photos are automatically downloaded when you view them in the app
+- You may need to clear your device's trash/recently deleted folder to fully reclaim the space
+
+**What gets deleted:**
+- Only photos that are successfully backed up to Ente
+- Local copies on your device's internal storage
+- Photos from your device's camera roll and other backed-up albums
+
+**What stays:**
+- Photos not yet backed up (they'll be protected from deletion)
+- All photos remain in Ente's cloud
+- Any photos in albums you haven't selected for backup
+
+### Re-downloading photos
+
+When you free up space, photos are removed from your device but stay in Ente. To view a photo:
+- Simply open it in the Ente app
+- It will be downloaded automatically when you view it
+- Downloaded photos use your device storage again
+
+## Remove exact duplicates
+
+If you have an existing library with duplicate photos across different albums, you can use the manual deduplication tool to keep only one copy while maintaining your album structure.
+
+### How it works
+
+The deduplication tool:
+1. Scans your entire Ente library for exact duplicate files (same hash)
+2. Keeps one copy of each unique file
+3. Replaces duplicates with symlinks in all albums
+4. Your album structure remains unchanged
+5. Storage space consumed by duplicates is freed up
+
+### Using the deduplication tool
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Free up space > Remove duplicates`, review the duplicates found, and confirm to remove them.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Deduplicate files`, review the duplicates found, and confirm to remove them.
+
+### What happens during deduplication
+
+- Exact duplicate files across all albums are identified
+- Only one physical copy of each file is retained
+- Symlinks (references) are created in all albums that had the duplicate
+- Your photos remain visible in all their original albums
+- Storage quota is reduced by the space occupied by removed duplicates
+
+> **Note**: This tool only removes exact duplicates (same file hash). For similar but not identical photos, use the "Similar images" feature below.
+
+## Remove similar images
+
+Ente provides an ML-powered tool to find and remove photos that are similar but not exactly the same. This is useful if you've taken multiple shots of the same scene and want to keep only the best ones.
+
+### How it works
+
+The similar images feature:
+1. Uses on-device machine learning to find visually similar photos
+2. Groups similar photos together for review
+3. Lets you choose which photos to keep and which to delete
+4. Automatically manages symlinks to maintain album integrity
+5. Works across all albums in your library
+
+### Using the similar images tool
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Free up space > Similar images`, review each group of similar photos, choose which to keep and which to delete, and confirm your selections.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+The "Similar images" feature is currently only available on mobile. Desktop only supports exact duplicate detection via `Settings > Deduplicate files`.
+
+### Smart album management
+
+When removing similar images, Ente intelligently handles your albums:
+
+- If you delete a photo that exists in multiple albums, Ente keeps it in those albums
+- If you delete the only copy of a photo from an album, Ente automatically adds a symlink to one of the kept similar photos
+- This ensures no album loses all its photos from a scene
+- You can safely prune similar images without worrying about album structure
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+The similar images feature requires:
+- Machine learning to be enabled (for detecting similar images)
+- Photos to be indexed (happens automatically after enabling ML)
+- Available on mobile and desktop apps
+
+Learn more about [Machine learning](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning).
+
+## Understanding storage in Ente
+
+**Cloud storage (your Ente quota):**
+- This is the storage space in your Ente account
+- Counted against your plan's storage limit (e.g., 100 GB, 1 TB)
+- Use deduplication and similar images tools to optimize
+
+**Device storage (your phone/computer):**
+- This is the physical storage on your device
+- Use "Free up space" to reclaim device storage
+- Photos remain in Ente and can be re-downloaded anytime
+
+**Trash:**
+- Items in trash count against your cloud storage quota
+- Permanently delete items or empty trash to free up space
+- Items are automatically deleted after 30 days
+
+Learn more in [Trash](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/trash).

-## Preserving folder structure
+The **Albums** feature guide has moved to:
 
-When you upload photos and videos into Ente using the desktop app - whether by
-dragging and dropping a folder or zip file (or selecting it in the "Upload"
-selector), or by setting up a [folder watch](/photos/features/watch-folders) -
-the app will provide you various options.

+- [iOS album backup](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#ios-album-backup) - How Ente handles multiple iOS albums
 
-If you are trying to just upload some files, then the app will provide you a
-selector where you can choose to (a) uploads all the files to an existing Ente
-album, or (b) create a new album.
-
-Similarly, if you upload a folder without any nested folders, than the app will
-ask if you want to upload them to an existing Ente album, or create a new album.
-
-The app will also try to intelligently determine the name of the new album.
-
-### Uploading a nested folder
-
-If the folder you're trying to upload has nesting and you select the option to
-create a new album, you will see two options - **A single album** and **Separate
-albums**.
-
-- **Single album** will create a new Ente album with the same name as the
-  folder's name, and will then sync all the changes in the folder (and any
-  nested folders) to this single album.
-
-- **Separate albums** will create separate albums for each nested folder of the
-  selected folder, and will then sync the changes in each nested folder
-  separately.
-
-- For example, suppose you have a folder name `Photos` on your computer, and
-  inside that folder you have two nested folders named `New Year` and `Summer`.
-  In the single album mode, the app will create an Ente album named "Photos" and
-  put all the files from both `New Year` and `Summer` there. In the separate
-  album mode, the app will create two Ente albums, "New Year" and "Summer", each
-  only containing the respective files.
-
-- In separate album mode, only nested folders that have at least one file will
-  result in the creation of a new album – empty folders (or folders that only
-  contain other folders) will be ignored.
-
-- In separate album mode, only the leafmost folder name is considered. For
-  example, both `A/B/C/D/x.png` and `1/2/3/D/y.png` will get uploaded into the
-  same Ente album named "D".
-
-> [!NOTE]
->
-> Ente albums cannot be nested currently. That is, in the **separate album**
-> mode described above, Ente will create a separate album for each nested
-> folder, but these Ente albums themselves will not be nested.

+title: Duplicate detection
+description: How Ente automatically detects and handles duplicate photos during backup
+---
+
+# Duplicate detection
+
+Ente automatically detects and handles duplicate files during backup to save storage space and upload time. This happens transparently in the background without any action required from you.
+
+## How automatic detection works
+
+When uploading photos and videos, Ente uses a hash-based system to identify duplicate files:
+
+**Same file to same album:**
+- If you try to upload an exact duplicate to an album where it already exists, Ente will skip it entirely
+- This allows you to safely resume interrupted uploads or re-upload folders without creating duplicates
+
+**Same file to different albums:**
+- If the same file already exists in a different album, Ente creates a symlink (reference) instead of storing it again
+- The file appears in both albums, but storage is only counted once
+- This is the same behavior as using "Add to album" within Ente
+
+## Platform-specific behavior
+
+The duplicate detection works slightly differently on each platform to match platform conventions:
+
+### Mobile (iOS and Android)
+
+- Uses hash-based detection for exact duplicates
+- If uploading to the same album: duplicate is skipped
+- If uploading to a different album: creates a symlink (no data uploaded)
+- Storage is only counted once regardless of how many albums contain the photo
+
+### Web and desktop
+
+On laptops using the web or desktop app, both the file hash AND filename are used for detection:
+
+- A file is considered duplicate if it has the same name AND same hash
+- This assumes users want to keep two copies if they have the same file but with different names
+- If uploading to the same album: exact duplicate (same name + hash) is skipped
+- If uploading to a different album: symlink is created (similar to "Add to album")
+
+## Benefits
+
+**Saves storage space:**
+- Each unique file is only stored once, even if it appears in multiple albums
+- Symlinks count minimal storage compared to full copies
+
+**Saves upload time:**
+- Duplicate files are detected immediately and skipped
+- Only new or modified files need to be uploaded
+
+**Enables safe re-uploads:**
+- You can safely drag and drop the same folder multiple times
+- Resume interrupted uploads without worrying about duplicates
+- Reinstall the app and re-configure backups without creating duplicates
+
+## Adding files to albums within Ente
+
+Once a file is backed up to Ente, adding it to another Ente album always creates a symlink. This means:
+- You can add photos to as many albums as you want
+- Storage is only counted once
+- Changes or deletions affect the file across all albums

+title: Export
+description: Export your photos from Ente to local storage
+---
+
+# Export
+
+Export allows you to download your entire Ente library or specific albums to local storage. This creates a local backup of your photos while keeping them safely stored in Ente's cloud.
+
+## Why use export?
+
+Export is useful for:
+- **Local backups**: Keep a copy of your photos on your computer or NAS
+- **Data portability**: Export your data in a standard format you can use anywhere
+- **Redundancy**: Have multiple copies of your precious memories
+- **Offline access**: Keep a complete local copy for when you're without internet
+
+## Export options
+
+### Desktop/Web continuous export
+
+The desktop and web apps offer continuous export, which automatically exports new items as they're uploaded to Ente.
+
+**How to set up:**
+
+1. Open `Settings > Export data`
+2. Choose a destination folder on your computer
+3. Enable "Continuous export"
+4. The app will automatically export new items in the background
+
+**Important notes:**
+- The desktop app must be running for continuous export to work
+- Exports happen in the background without interrupting your work
+- Incremental exports only download new or changed files
+
+### CLI export
+
+For advanced users and automation, use the [Ente CLI](/photos/features/utilities/cli) to export via command line. The CLI is particularly useful for:
+- Automated exports with cron jobs
+- Server-to-server transfers
+- NAS sync setups
+
+## What gets exported
+
+### Album structure
+
+Your album structure is fully preserved during export. Each album becomes a separate folder with your photos organized exactly as they are in Ente.
+
+**Example structure:**
+```
+export-folder/
+├── Vacation 2024/
+│   ├── photo1.jpg
+│   └── photo2.jpg
+├── Family/
+│   └── photo3.jpg
+└── Best Photos/
+    └── photo1.jpg  # Same file in multiple albums
+```
+
+### Metadata preservation
+
+Metadata is exported as separate JSON files alongside your photos. The original files are **not modified**.
+
+**Format:**
+```
+photo.jpg
+metadata/photo.jpg.json
+```
+
+The JSON format matches Google Takeout format, so tools that support Google Takeout imports can read Ente's exported metadata.
+
+For details about the metadata format, see [Metadata and Editing FAQ](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing#export-data-preserve-metadata).
+
+### Files in multiple albums
+
+If a photo exists in multiple albums:
+- **In Ente**: Counts as 1 file (storage counted once)
+- **On export**: Appears in each album folder (downloaded multiple times)
+
+This is why your export size may be larger than your Ente storage usage.
+
+## Export limitations
+
+### Two-way sync not supported
+
+Exports create a **one-way sync** from Ente to your local storage. Changes to exported files do not sync back to Ente.
+
+**Important:** Do **not** export to the same folder that you're watching for uploads. This will cause:
+- Duplicate files
+- Export stalling
+- Undefined behavior
+
+**Best practice:** Use separate folders for:
+- Upload source (watch folders)
+- Export destination (local backups)
+
+### Network drives (NAS)
+
+Exporting to network drives generally works better than importing from them:
+- File system interaction is simpler for exports
+- Performance is usually acceptable
+
+**Windows UNC path issue:** If exporting to a UNC path (`\\server\share`), map it to a network drive letter first. File separators don't work correctly with UNC paths and the export won't start.
+
+Learn more in [Troubleshooting NAS issues](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#nas).
+
+## Incremental exports
+
+Both desktop continuous export and CLI exports are **incremental**:
+- Only new or changed files are downloaded
+- Gracefully handles interruptions
+- Safe to stop and restart without re-downloading everything
+- Saves time and bandwidth

+title: Backup
+description: How automatic backup works in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Backup
+
+Ente provides automatic, continuous backup of your photos and videos with end-to-end encryption. Once configured, your precious memories are safely synced to Ente's cloud without any manual effort.
+
+## How backup works
+
+### Mobile backup (iOS and Android)
+
+Ente will automatically backup any albums in your native photos app that you select for backup. The app runs in the background, and any new photos added to these albums (or any photos in these albums that were modified) will be automatically synced to Ente.
+
+**Key features:**
+- **Background sync**: New photos are uploaded automatically without needing to open the app
+- **Original quality**: Photos and videos are backed up in their original quality with no compression
+- **Smart resumption**: If backup is interrupted, it automatically resumes from where it left off
+- **Battery and data aware**: By default, uploads happen over WiFi to save mobile data and battery
+
+### Desktop backup (Mac, Windows, Linux)
+
+On desktop, you can use [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) to automatically backup photos from specific directories on your computer. This creates a one-way sync from your computer to Ente.
+
+## Selecting albums to backup
+
+You can choose which albums should be backed up when you first sign up for Ente. If you change your mind later, or if you create a new album in your native photos app that you also want to backup, you can modify your choices:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > Backup > Backed up folders` and select or deselect albums as needed.
+
+**On desktop:**
+Use the [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) feature to select directories to sync.
+
+## Background sync {#background-sync}
+
+Ente Photos supports seamless background sync so that you don't need to open the app to backup your photos. It will sync in the background and automatically backup the albums that you have selected for syncing.
+
+Day to day sync will work automatically. However, there are some platform specific considerations that apply:
+
+### iOS
+
+On iOS, if you have a very large number of photos and videos, then you might need to keep Ente running in the foreground for the first backup to happen (since we get only a limited amount of background execution time). To help with this, under `Settings > Backup` there is an option to disable the automatic device screen lock. But once your initial backup has completed, subsequent backups will work fine in the background and don't need disabling the screen lock.
+
+On iOS, Ente will not backup videos in the background (since videos are usually much larger and need more time to upload than what we get). However, they will get backed up the next time the Ente app is opened.
+
+Note that the Ente app will not be able to backup in the background if you force kill the app.
+
+> If you're curious, the way this works is, our servers "tickle" your device every once in a while by sending a silent push notification, which wakes up our app and gives it 30 seconds to execute a background sync. However, if you have killed the app from recents, iOS will not deliver the push to the app, breaking the background sync.
+
+### Android
+
+On some Android versions, newly downloaded apps activate a mode called "Optimize battery usage" which prevents them from running in the background. So you will need to disable this "Optimize battery usage" mode in the system settings for Ente if you wish for Ente to automatically back up your photos in the background.
+
+On Android versions 15 and later, if an app is in private space and the private space is locked, Android doesn't allow the app to run any background processes. As a result, background sync will not work.
+
+### Desktop
+
+In addition to our mobile apps, the background sync also works on our desktop app through the [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) feature.
+
+### Troubleshooting background sync
+
+- On iOS, make sure that you're not killing the Ente app.
+- On Android, make sure that "Optimize battery usage" is not turned on in system settings for the Ente app.
+
+## Understanding backup behavior
+
+### What gets backed up
+
+- All photos and videos in selected albums
+- Original quality files (no compression)
+- Photo metadata (EXIF, location, date/time)
+- Live Photos (both photo and video components)
+
+### What happens when files are deleted
+
+If a file is deleted from your native photos app, it will still remain in Ente. This is by design - on both iOS and Android, apps are not allowed to automatically delete users' photos without manual confirmation for security reasons.
+
+If you want to delete a photo from Ente, you need to do it manually within the Ente app.
+
+### Duplicate handling
+
+Ente automatically detects duplicates during upload. If you try to upload the same photo multiple times, Ente will recognize it and skip the duplicate, saving your storage space.
+
+Learn more about how [Duplicate detection](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection) works.
+
+## Backup frequency
+
+- **Mobile**: Background sync happens automatically. The exact timing depends on your device's operating system.
+- **Desktop**: Watch folders continuously monitor for changes and upload new files as they appear.

+description:
+    Automatic syncing of selected folders using the Ente Photos desktop app
+---
+
+# Watch folders
+
+The Ente desktop app allows you to "watch" a folder on your computer for any
+changes, creating a one-way background sync from folders on your computer to
+Ente albums. This is intended to automate your photo management and backup.
+
+By using the "Watch folders" option in the sidebar, you can tell the desktop app
+which are the folders that you want to watch for changes. The app will then
+automatically upload new files added to these folders to the corresponding ente
+album (it will also upload them initially). And if a file is deleted locally,
+then the corresponding Ente file will also be automatically moved to
+uncategorized.
+
+Paired with the option to run Ente automatically when your computer starts, this
+allows you to automate backups to ente's cloud.
+
+### Steps
+
+1. Press the **Watch folders** button in the sidebar. This will open up a dialog
+   where you can add and remove watched folders.
+
+2. To start watching a folder, press the **Add folder** button and select the
+   folder on your system that you want to watch for any changes. You can also
+   drag and drop the folder here.
+
+3. If the folder has nesting, you will see two options - **A single album** and
+   **Separate albums**. This work similarly to the
+   [options you see when you drag and drop a folder with nested folders](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/albums#preserving-folder-structure).
+
+4. After choosing any of the above options, the folder will be initially synced
+   to Ente's cloud and monitored for any changes. You can now close the dialog
+   and the sync will continue in background.
+
+5. When the app is syncing in the background it'll show a small progress status
+   in the bottom right. You can expand it to see more details if needed.
+
+6. You can stop watching any folder by clicking on the three dots next to the
+   watch folder entry, and then selecting **Stop watching**.
+
+> Note: In case you start a new upload while an existing sync is in progress,
+> the sync will be paused then and resumed when your upload is done.
+
+Some more details about the feature are in our
+[blog post](https://ente.io/blog/watch-folders) announcing it.
+
+## 2-way sync
+
+Note that a two way sync is not currently supported. Attempting to export data
+to the same folder that is also being watched by the Ente app will result in
+undefined behaviour (e.g. duplicate files, export stalling etc).

-Ente allows you to collaborate with people in 2 ways:

-## Collaborative albums
-
-Collaborative albums allow multiple Ente users to add photos to the same shared
-album. Storage is only counted once, irrespective of the number of collaborators
-and viewers.
-
-- The owner of the album is the person who created it.
-
-- The owner can add collaborators and viewers by their email. The owner can also
-  change permissions of participants at any time, and remove them.
-
-- Collaborators can add photos (and videos) to the shared album.
-
-- The storage of the photo is counted towards the owner of the photo - the
-  person who uploaded it. Since the uploader usually has the photo in their
-  account anyway, effectively this means that the photo can be added to a
-  collaborative album without paying anything extra.
-
-- The owner of the photo can remove it from the album (or delete it).
-
-- The owner of the album can remove all photos from the album (they can only
-  delete the photos they own).
-
-- When a collaborator is removed from a shared album (or when they leave the
-  album), any photos they'd uploaded will also be removed.
-
-Currently collaborative albums can only be used from the mobile app. A
-collaborator will see them in view only mode in the web and desktop apps; we're
-actively working on adding support for them on web and desktop too.
-
-## Collaborative links
-
-Collaborative links allow you to collaborate with people who might not have an
-Ente account or the Ente apps.
-
-- You can create a public link, and anyone with access to the link will be able
-  to view the shared photos using just their web browser (no login required).
-
-- You can enable the "Allow adding photos" option on a public link to allow
-  people to also add photos the same way (from their web browser, no login
-  required).
-
-Such collaborative links are also sometimes called "collect links", since they
-allow you to collect photos from people without them needing Ente accounts. A
-common use case for this is collecting event and trip photos from a big circle
-of people.
+---
 
-The storage for the photos added to a collaborative link are counted towards the
-album owner. The owner can also remove these photos at any time.

+- [Custom domains FAQ](/photos/faq/sharing-and-collaboration#custom-domains) - Setup and configuration questions
+- [Public links](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/public-links) - General link sharing
 
-The custom domains feature allows you to instead create a link that uses your own domain, say
-
-```
-https://pics.example.org/?t=...
-```
-
-You don't need to run any servers or manage any services, Ente will still host and serve your album for you, the only thing that changes is that you can serve your links using your personalized domain.
-
-## Availability
-
-The custom domains feature requires the ability to publicly share albums which for abuse prevention reasons can only be done by people with an active Ente subscription.
-
-## Setup
-
-The setup involves two steps:
-
-1. Letting Ente know about the domain you wish to use for serving your public links
-2. Updating your DNS settings to point your domain (or subdomain) to **my.ente.io**
-
-For people who are comfortable with changing DNS settings on their domain provider, this entire process is very simple will take a minute. For people who are not comfortable with changing DNS, we will provide a more detailed breakdown below.
-
-Let's dive in.
-
-To make the process concrete, let's assume we're trying to use _pics.example.org_ as our custom domain. Note that there is no restriction to use a subdomain, a top level domain can be used as a custom domain too. That is, either of _example.org_ or _subdomain.example.org_ is fine, Ente will work with both.
-
-### Step 1 - Link your domain
-
-The first step is to let Ente know about the domain or subdomain you wish to use by linking it to your account.
-
-> [!WARNING]
->
-> Currently (Sep 2025) the ability to link a custom domain is only present in Ente's web app, [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io).
-
-Head over to Preferences > Custom domains, in the domain field enter "pics.example.org" (replace with your subdomain) and press "Save". That's it. The linking is done.
-
-### Step 2 - Add DNS entry
-
-The second step is to add a CNAME entry in your DNS provider that forwards requests for pics.example.org (replace with your subdomain) to **my.ente.io**.
-
-Specifically, you need to add a `CNAME record` from the domain (or subdomain) of your choice to `my.ente.io`. You can leave the `TTL` at its default.
-
-| Record Type |            Name            |        Value | TTL            |
-| ----------- | :------------------------: | -----------: | -------------- |
-| CNAME       | Your subdomain, e.g `pics` | `my.ente.io` | Auto (default) |
-
-The exact steps for doing this depend on the DNS provider that you're using.
-
-> Your DNS provider usually is the service from which you bought your domain. The domain name seller will provide some sort of an admin panel where you can configure your DNS settings.
-
-As concrete examples, here is how this step would look for Cloudflare:
-
-![Adding a CNAME for custom domain in Cloudflare](cf.png)
-
-Note that orange proxy option is off. And here is how it would look for Namecheap:
-
-![Adding a CNAME for custom domain in Namecheap](nc.png)
-
-> [!NOTE]
->
-> The examples are using "pics" as the subdomain, but that's just an example, you can use anything you like (or use "@" if you'd like to use the root domain itself).
-
-The time it takes for DNS records to update is dependent on your DNS provider. Usually the changes should start reflecting within a few minutes, and should almost always reflect within an hour.
-
-Once the DNS changes have been applied, then you can take any public link to your shared albums, replace `albums.ente.io` with your choice (e.g. `pics.example.org`), and the link will still work.
-
-You don't need to do this manually though, the apps will do it for you. More on this in the next section. But first, some troubleshooting tips.
-
-### Troubleshooting
-
-If your domain is not working, go through the following checklist.
-
-- The CNAME should be from your domain to my.ente.io, not the other way around. That is, `pics.example.org => my.ente.io`.
-
-- If you're using Cloudflare DNS, make sure that the "Orange" proxy status toggle is off, and the Proxy status is the "Grey" DNS only.
-
-## Using
-
-Using is trivial. When you go to an album's sharing options and copy the link to it, Ente will automatically copy the link that uses your configured domain.
-
-> [!WARNING]
->
-> Currently (Sep 2025) the ability to automatically substitute your custom domain is present in Ente's web and mobile apps, but not in the desktop app (The next desktop version to be released will have that ability too).
-
-## Unsetting
-
-To stop using your custom domain, we need to undo the two steps we did during setup.
-
-1. Unlink your domain in Ente. This can be done just by going to Preferences > Custom Domains, clearing the value in the "Domain" input and pressing "Update".
-
-2. Remove the CNAME record you added during setup in your DNS provider.
-
-## Implementation
+---
 
-Our engineers also wrote [explainer](https://ente.io/blog/custom-domains/) of how this works behind the scenes.

-# Deduplicate
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-Ente performs two different duplicate detections: one during uploads, and one
-that can be manually run afterwards to remove duplicates and very similar files across albums.
+The **Deduplication** feature guide has moved to:
 
-## During uploads
+## Duplicate Detection
+- [Duplicate detection feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection) - Complete guide to automatic duplicate detection and removal
 
-Ente will automatically deduplicate and ignore duplicate files during uploads.
+## Related topics
+- [How does deduplication work?](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#deduplication) - FAQ about duplicate handling
+- [Storage optimization](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization) - Other ways to optimize storage
 
-When uploading, Ente will ignore exact duplicate files. This allows you to
-resume interrupted uploads, or drag and drop the same folder, or reinstall the
-app, and expect Ente to automatically skip duplicates and only add new files.
-
-The duplicate detection works slightly differently on each platform, to cater to
-the platform's nuances.
-
-#### Mobile
-
-- On iOS, a hash will be used to detect exact duplicates. If the duplicate is
-  being uploaded to an album where a photo with the same hash already exists,
-  then the duplicate will be skipped. If it is being uploaded to a different
-  album, then a symlink will be created (so no actual data will need to be
-  uploaded, just a symlink will be created to the existing file).
-
-- On Android also, a hash check is used. But unlike iOS, the native Android
-  filesystem behaviour is to keep physical copies if the same photo is in
-  different albums. So Ente does the same: duplicates to same album will be
-  skipped, duplicates when going to separate albums will create copies.
-
-#### Web and desktop
-
-On laptops (i.e. when using the Ente web or desktop app), in addition to a hash
-check, the file name is also used. The assumption is that the user wishes to
-keep two copies if they have the same file but with different names.
-
-Thus a file will be considered a duplicate and skipped during upload if a file
-with the same name and hash already exists in the album.
-
-And if you're trying to upload it to a different album (i.e. the same file with
-the same name already exists in a different album), then a symlink to the
-existing file will be created. This is similar to what happens when you do "Add
-to album", and the actual files are not re-uploaded.
-
-## Manual deduplication
-
-Ente provides a tool for manual de-duplication in _Settings → Backup → Free up space →
-Remove duplicates_. This is useful if you have an existing library with
-duplicates across different albums, but wish to keep only one copy.
-
-During this operation, Ente will discard duplicates across all albums, retain a
-single copy, and add symlinks to this copy within all existing albums. So your
-existing album structure remains unchanged, while the space consumed by the
-duplicate data is freed up.
-
-## Filtering similar images
-
-Ente also provides a tool for manual removal of images that are similar, but not the exact same, using our private ML. This feature can be found in _Settings → Backup → Free up space →
-Similar images_. This is useful if you've taken a lot of similar photos, potentiall even in different albums, and want to keep only the best ones.
-
-During this filtering process you can choose which photos to keep and which to delete for each set of similar images. Ente will then automatically add symlinks for the kept photos to any albums that only had the deleted images. This way you can easily prune similar images, without worrying about accidentally removing the best ones from a certain album.
-
-## Adding to Ente album creates symlinks
+---
 
-Note that once a file is in Ente, adding it to another Ente album will create a
-symlink, so that you can add it to as many albums as you wish but storage will
-only be counted once.

-Legacy allows trusted contacts to recover your account in your absence. The main
-usecase here is to pass on your memories after your death. It can also be useful
-for other cases - for e.g., when you forget your password and recovery key.
+The **Legacy** (Account Recovery) feature guide has moved to:
 
-Trusted Contacts can initiate a recovery, and if not blocked in 30 days, would
-be able to change the password to your account and thereby access your memories.

+- [Legacy contacts](/photos/faq/advanced-features#legacy) - Setting up trusted contacts
 
-You can add a trusted contact for your account using the mobile app for Ente
-Photos. Go to Settings -> Account -> Legacy, and click on "Add Trusted Contact".
-
-You would be asked to enter the email address of the trusted contact you want to
-add or choose from a list of contacts on Ente. Please note that the trusted
-contact must be an Ente user.
-
-<div align="center">
-
-![Add Trusted Contact](add_trusted_contact.png){width=300px}
-
-</div>
-
-The trusted contact must accept your request. They can do so by going to
-Settings -> Account -> Legacy in the Ente Photos mobile app, and clicking on
-your email address within the Legacy accounts sections. Ente would also send an
-email notification to the trusted contact to nudge them to accept the invite.
-
-<div align="center">

-Once the recovery is initiated, the account owner would get 30 days to block the
-recovery. After 30 days, you can go the same page in the app, where you will be
-prompted to change the password of the account. Once you change the password,
-you would be able to access the recovered account with the new password.
-
-## Blocking account recovery by a trusted contact
-
-After a trusted contact initiates a recover, you, as the account owner, would
-get 30 days to block the recovery. To do this, you must go to Settings ->
-Account -> Legacy, where you will see a message that recovery of the account has
-been initiated. Tapping on that will allow you to block the recovery.
-
-## Removing a trusted contact

-# Machine learning
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-Ente supports on-device machine learning. This allows you to use the latest
-advances in AI in a privacy preserving manner.
+The **Machine Learning** feature guide has moved to:
 
-- You can search for your photos by the **Faces** of the people in them. Ente
-  will show you all the faces in a photo, and will also try to group similar
-  faces together to create clusters of people so that you can give them names,
-  and quickly find all photos with a given person in them.
+## Machine Learning Features
+- [Machine learning feature guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning) - Complete guide to on-device ML, face recognition, and magic search
 
-- You can search for your photos by typing natural language descriptions of
-  them. For example, you can search for "night", "by the seaside", or "the red
-  motorcycle next to a fountain". Within the app, this ability is referred to as
-  **Magic search**.
-
-You can enable face recognition and magic search in the app's preferences on
-either the mobile app or the desktop app.
-
-On mobile, this is available under `General > Advanced > Machine learning`.
-
-On desktop, this is available under `Preferences > Machine learning`.
-
----
-
-The app needs to download your original photos to index them. This is faster
-over WiFi. Indexing is also faster on your computer as compared to your mobile
-device.
-
-> [!TIP]
->
-> If you have a large library on Ente, we recommend enabling this feature on the
-> desktop app first, because it can index your existing photos faster. Once your
-> existing photos have been indexed, then you can use either. The mobile app is
-> fast enough to index new photos as they are being backed up.
->
-> Also, it is beneficial to enable machine learning before importing your
-> photos, as this allows the Ente app to index your files as they are getting
-> uploaded instead of needing to download them again.
-
-The indexes are synced across all your devices automatically using the same
-end-to-end encrypted security that we use for syncing your photos.
-
----
-
-#### Local indexing on mobile
-
-In general the machine learning is optimized to work well on most mobile device.
-However, devices with low RAM (4-6GB) and large photo libraries might struggle
-to complete the indexing without affecting performance of the app. In such case,
-you might want to disable local indexing and let the desktop run it instead.
-
-You can disable local indexing from the settings, under
-`General > Advanced > Machine learning > Configuration`. This way, you can
-continue to use the ML features without your phone performance taking any hit.

-# Passkeys
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-Passkeys are a new authentication mechanism that uses strong cryptography built
-into devices, like Windows Hello or Apple's Touch ID. **You can use passkeys as
-a second factor to secure your Ente account.**
+The **Passkeys** feature guide has moved to:
 
-> [!TIP]

-> credentials.
->
-> - More details about why and how are in the Passkeys announcement

-Ente already supports TOTP codes (in fact, we built an
-[entire app](https://ente.io/auth/) to store them...). Passkeys serve as an
-alternative 2FA (second factor) mechanism.
-
-If you add a passkey to your Ente account, it will be used instead of any
-existing 2FA codes that you have configured (if any).
-
-## Enabling and disabling passkeys
-
-Passkeys get enabled if you add one (or more) passkeys to your account.
-Conversely, passkeys get disabled if you remove all your existing passkeys.
-
-To add and remove passkeys, use the _Passkey_ option in the settings menu. This
-will open up _accounts.ente.io_, where you can manage your passkeys.
-
-## Login with passkeys
-
-If passkeys are enabled, then _accounts.ente.io_ will automatically open when
-you log into your Ente account on a new device. Here you can follow the
-instructions given by the browser to verify your passkey.
-
-> These instructions different for each browser and device, but generally they
-> will ask you to use the same mechanism that you used when you created the
-> passkey to verify it (scanning a QR code, using your fingerprint, pressing the
-> key on your Yubikey or other security key hardware etc).
-
-## Recovery
-
-If you are unable to login with your passkey (e.g. if you have misplaced the
-hardware key that you used to store your passkey), then you can **recover your
-account by using your Ente recovery key**.
-
-During login, press cancel on the browser dialog to verify your passkey, and
-then select the "Recover two-factor" option in the error message that gets
-shown. This will take you to a place where you can enter your Ente recovery key
-and login into your account. Now you can go to the _Passkey_ page to delete the
-lost passkey and/or add a new one.

-If you have lost access to both your passkey and recovery key, please reach out
-to [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) for help.

+# Face Recognition
+
+Face recognition in Ente helps you find and organize photos by the people in them. All face recognition happens entirely on your device, maintaining your privacy while providing powerful search capabilities.
+
+## How Face Recognition Works
+
+When you enable face recognition:
+1. Ente detects all faces in your photos
+2. Similar faces are automatically grouped together
+3. You can name these groupings to identify people
+4. Search for specific people by name
+5. Find all photos containing particular persons
+
+All of this happens on your device. Your photos and face data are never sent to Ente's servers.
+
+## Enabling Face Recognition
+
+Face recognition is part of Ente's machine learning features. You must enable it manually (it's off by default).
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning`, enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**, and wait for indexing to complete.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning`, enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**, and monitor indexing progress.
+
+> **Note**: Face recognition is not available on web.ente.io. You must use the mobile or desktop app.
+
+### Initial Indexing
+
+After enabling face recognition:
+- The app downloads your photos to index them locally
+- Progress is shown as a percentage (e.g., "Indexing... 45%")
+- This is faster over WiFi and on desktop computers
+- Once complete, faces are grouped automatically
+
+**Indexing tips:**
+- For large libraries, enable on desktop first (faster indexing)
+- Keep the app open during initial indexing
+- Once indexed on one device, the indexes sync to other devices
+
+Learn more about [Machine learning](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning).
+
+## Using Face Recognition
+
+### Viewing recognized faces
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Tap the search icon at the bottom right
+2. Scroll to the **People** section
+3. Browse all recognized face groupings
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Access the People section through the search interface
+
+### Naming persons
+
+Once faces are grouped, you can assign names to identify people:
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the People section
+2. Tap on a person cluster
+3. Tap **Add name** or the edit icon
+4. Enter the person's name
+5. The person is now searchable by name
+
+**On desktop:**
+1. Open a person grouping
+2. Click **Add a name**
+3. Enter the person's name
+
+After naming, you can search for that person by typing their name in the search bar.
+
+### Searching for specific people
+
+Once you've named persons:
+- Type the person's name in the search bar
+- All photos containing that person will appear
+- Works across all your albums
+- Search is instant and happens on your device
+
+## Managing Face Groupings
+
+### Merging persons
+
+If the same person is split into multiple groupings, you can merge them by assigning the same name.
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Make sure one grouping has a name assigned
+2. Open the second grouping
+3. Tap the **Add a name** banner
+4. Instead of typing, tap the existing name from the list
+5. The two groupings are now merged
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Similarly, use the **Add a name** button
+- Select an existing person from the list to merge
+
+### De-merging persons
+
+If incorrectly grouped faces were merged, you can undo the merge.
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the person
+2. Tap **Review suggestions**
+3. Tap the **History icon** (top right)
+4. Tap the **minus icon** beside the group you want to de-merge
+
+**On desktop:**
+1. Open the person
+2. Click **Review suggestions**
+3. Click the **history icon** (top right)
+4. Undo previous merges if necessary
+
+### Removing incorrect faces from a person
+
+Sometimes the wrong face gets grouped with a person. You can remove incorrect faces:
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the person from the People section
+2. Tap the three dots (overflow menu)
+3. Select **Edit**
+4. Long-press on photos with incorrect faces
+5. Select the photos to remove
+6. Tap **Remove** from the action bar
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Currently, editing face groupings is only supported on mobile
+- Desktop can view and name persons, but not modify groupings
+
+### Changing the cover photo for a person
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the person grouping
+2. Long-press the image you want as the cover
+3. Tap **Use as cover**
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Desktop currently doesn't support picking a cover
+- It defaults to the most recent image
+
+### Ignoring certain persons
+
+You can tell the app not to show certain face groupings.
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Make sure the person is **not named** (if named, tap **Remove person label** first)
+2. Inside the unnamed grouping, tap **Ignore person** from the top right menu
+
+**To undo:**
+1. Open a photo containing the ignored person
+2. Open **file info**
+3. Tap the **face thumbnail** of the ignored person
+4. Tap **Show person**
+
+**On desktop:**
+- Use the **Ignore** option from the top right menu
+- To undo, open that person via file info and select **Show person**
+
+## Special Cases
+
+### Photos of babies and toddlers
+
+Face recognition models (including Ente's) struggle with pictures of babies and young children. Faces change rapidly at that age, making grouping difficult.
+
+If you find a mixed grouping with several different babies:
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the mixed grouping
+2. Tap the **mixed grouping** option in the top right menu
+3. The model will re-evaluate with stricter settings
+4. This should separate different babies into different groupings
+
+> **Note**: This functionality is currently only available on mobile.
+
+## Platform Differences
+
+### Mobile apps (iOS and Android)
+- ✅ View recognized faces
+- ✅ Name persons
+- ✅ Merge and de-merge persons
+- ✅ Remove incorrect faces
+- ✅ Change cover photos
+- ✅ Ignore persons
+- ✅ Handle mixed groupings
+
+### Desktop apps (Mac, Windows, Linux)
+- ✅ View recognized faces
+- ✅ Name persons
+- ✅ Merge persons (by assigning same name)
+- ❌ Cannot modify face groupings (edit, remove faces)
+- ❌ Cannot change cover photos
+- ✅ Can ignore persons
+
+**Current limitation**: Face grouping management (editing clusters, removing incorrect faces) must be done on the mobile app. Desktop apps can view and name persons but cannot modify the groupings themselves.
+
+### Web (web.ente.io)
+- ❌ Face recognition not available
+- Must use mobile or desktop apps
+
+## Privacy and Security
+
+Face recognition in Ente maintains complete privacy:
+
+- **On-device processing**: All face detection and grouping happens on your device
+- **Encrypted face data**: Face recognition data is encrypted before syncing
+- **No server access**: Ente's servers never see your photos or face data
+- **Not used for training**: Your photos are never used to train AI models
+- **No third parties**: No data is shared with any third party services
+
+Your face recognition data is as private and secure as your photos themselves.
+
+Learn more in [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#ml-privacy).
+
+## Works Offline
+
+Once your photos have been indexed, face recognition works completely offline:
+- Search for people without internet
+- View face groupings offline
+- Name and manage persons offline
+- All operations happen locally on your device
+
+The initial indexing requires downloading your photos (which is faster over WiFi), but after that face recognition works without an internet connection.

+Ente provides multiple ways to search and discover your photos. From basic date and file name search to advanced AI-powered face recognition and natural language search, you can quickly find any photo in your library.
+
+## Basic Search
+
+### Date search
+
+Search for photos by specific dates, months, or years. Simply type a date in the search bar:
+- "January 2024" - finds all photos from that month
+- "2023" - finds all photos from that year
+- Specific dates like "July 15, 2024"
+
+### File name search
+
+Find photos by their original file names. Ente preserves file names from when you uploaded your photos, making it easy to find specific files.
+
+### Description search
+
+Search for words in descriptions or captions you've added to photos. This makes it easy to find specific memories you've documented.
+
+Learn more about [adding descriptions to photos](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing#descriptions).
+
+### Album search
+
+Search for albums by name or search within specific albums to narrow down results.
+
+## Location-Based Search
+
+### Map view
+
+Explore your photos visually on an interactive map. Any photo with GPS location data will appear on the map, letting you see where your photos were taken around the world.
+
+- View all photos on a global map
+- Zoom into specific locations
+- View individual album photos on the map
+- All location data is end-to-end encrypted
+
+### Location tags
+
+Create custom location labels to organize and find photos by place. Location tags let you:
+- Tag frequent places like "Home", "Office", or "Vacation"
+- Define a center point and radius for each location
+- Find photos within specific areas
+- Tag photos that don't have GPS data
+
+Location tags work entirely on your device and are end-to-end encrypted.

+- Find by colors: "red flowers", "blue car"
+- Search activities: "birthday cake", "swimming"
+
+Magic search uses on-device AI (CLIP) to understand the content of your photos. You can type natural language queries like "the red motorcycle next to a fountain" to find specific photos.
+
+**Learn more:** [Magic search](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/magic-search)
+
+### Enabling machine learning
+
+Both face recognition and magic search require enabling machine learning:
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning` and enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning` and enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**.
+
+After enabling, the app will download and index your photos locally. This is faster over WiFi and on desktop computers.
+
+**Learn more:** [Machine learning overview](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning)
+
+## Discovery Features
+
+### Memories
+
+Ente automatically creates collections of photos from past years on the same date, helping you rediscover memories.
+
+### People section
+
+Browse all recognized faces and persons in your library. Name persons to organize and find photos of specific people quickly.
+
+### Places
+
+Explore photos grouped by location clusters, making it easy to browse photos by where they were taken.
+
+## Search Tips
+
+### Combining search types
+
+You can combine different search methods to narrow down results:
+- Search for a person's name and then filter by date
+- Use magic search within a specific album
+- Search location tags and then browse by date
+
+### Understanding search results
+
+- Search results include photos from all albums unless you're searching within a specific album
+- Archived photos appear in search results
+- Hidden photos do not appear in search results
+
+Learn more in [Albums and Organization FAQ](/photos/faq/albums-and-organization#hide-vs-archive).
+
+### Best practices
+
+- **Enable ML early**: If you're migrating a large library, enable machine learning before importing to avoid downloading photos twice
+- **Use desktop for initial indexing**: Desktop apps can index faster than mobile for large libraries
+- **Add descriptions**: Enhance search by adding descriptions to important photos
+- **Name persons**: Face recognition becomes more useful once you name important people
+- **Create location tags**: Tag frequent places to make them easy to find
+
+### Platform-specific features
+
+- **Web (web.ente.io)**: Basic search (date, file name, description, album) - ML features not available
+- **Mobile apps**: All search features including ML (face recognition and magic search)
+- **Desktop apps**: All search features including ML (face recognition and magic search)
+
+> **Note**: Machine learning features (face recognition and magic search) only work on mobile and desktop apps, not on web.ente.io.
+
+## Privacy and Security
+
+All search features in Ente maintain end-to-end encryption:
+- Your photos remain encrypted on Ente's servers
+- Location data, location tags, and face data are all encrypted
+- Machine learning runs entirely on your device

+title: Machine learning
+description: Ente supports on-device machine learning for face recognition and natural language search
+---
+
+# Machine Learning
+
+Ente supports on-device machine learning, allowing you to use the latest advances in AI while maintaining your privacy. All machine learning happens entirely on your device - your photos and ML data are never sent to Ente's servers.
+
+## What Machine Learning Enables
+
+Machine learning in Ente powers two main features:
+
+### Face recognition
+
+Search for your photos by the people in them. Ente will:
+- Detect all faces in your photos
+- Group similar faces together to create clusters of people
+- Let you name persons for easy searching
+- Help you find all photos with specific people
+
+Learn more in the [Face recognition guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/face-recognition).
+
+### Magic search
+
+Search for your photos using natural language descriptions. You can search for:
+- Objects: "car", "dog", "food"
+- Scenes: "beach", "sunset", "mountain"
+- Colors: "red flowers", "blue sky"
+- Activities: "birthday cake", "swimming"
+- Complex queries: "the red motorcycle next to a fountain"
+
+Learn more in the [Magic search guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/magic-search).
+
+## Enable Machine Learning
+
+You can enable machine learning on either the mobile app or the desktop app.
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning` and enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning` and enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**.
+
+> **Note**: Machine learning is not available on web.ente.io. You must use the mobile or desktop apps.
+
+## The Indexing Process
+
+After enabling machine learning, the app needs to download and index your photos locally.
+
+### What happens during indexing
+
+1. **Download**: The app downloads your original photos to your device
+2. **Process**: ML models analyze each photo on your device
+3. **Index**: Search indexes are created locally
+4. **Encrypt & sync**: Indexes are encrypted and synced to your other devices
+
+### Indexing performance
+
+- **WiFi recommended**: Downloading photos is faster over WiFi
+- **Desktop is faster**: Desktop computers can index faster than mobile devices
+- **Time varies**: Indexing time depends on library size and device performance
+
+### Monitoring progress
+
+While indexing is in progress:
+- **Mobile**: Check `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning` for indexing status
+- **Desktop**: Progress shown in the app
+- **Search bar**: May show indexing status when clicked
+
+## Tips for Faster Indexing
+
+### Enable on desktop first
+
+> [!TIP]
+>
+> If you have a large library on Ente, we recommend enabling machine learning on the desktop app first. Desktop computers can index your existing photos faster than mobile devices. Once your existing photos have been indexed, the indexes sync to your mobile devices, and your mobile app can then quickly index new photos as they're backed up.
+
+### Enable before importing
+
+> [!TIP]
+>
+> If you're migrating a large library to Ente, enable machine learning before importing your photos. This allows the app to index your files as they're being uploaded, avoiding the need to download them again later for indexing.
+
+## Privacy and Security
+
+Machine learning in Ente maintains the same privacy guarantees as the rest of the app:
+
+- **On-device processing**: All ML analysis happens on your device
+- **Encrypted indexes**: Search indexes are encrypted before syncing
+- **No server access**: Ente's servers never see your unencrypted photos or ML data
+- **Not used for training**: Your photos are never used to train AI models
+
+Your face recognition data, magic search indexes, and photos remain private and encrypted.
+
+Learn more in [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#ml-privacy).
+
+## Syncing Indexes Across Devices
+
+The indexes created by machine learning are synced across all your devices automatically using end-to-end encryption. This means:
+
+- Index on one device, use on all devices
+- New photos are indexed incrementally on each device
+- Indexes are encrypted before syncing
+- No need to re-index on every device
+
+## Local Indexing Configuration
+
+### Disabling local indexing on mobile
+
+On mobile devices with low RAM (4-6GB) and large photo libraries, indexing might affect app performance. In such cases, you can disable local indexing on mobile and let your desktop handle it instead.
+
+**To disable local indexing on mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning > Configuration` and disable local indexing.
+
+This way, you can continue to use ML features without impacting your phone's performance. The desktop app will handle indexing, and the indexes will sync to your mobile device.
+
+## Platform Differences
+
+### Mobile apps (iOS and Android)
+- Full ML support: face recognition and magic search
+- Can modify face groupings (merge, de-merge, ignore)
+- Can name persons and manage face clusters
+- Local indexing can be disabled for low-end devices
+
+### Desktop apps (Mac, Windows, Linux)
+- Full ML support: face recognition and magic search
+- Faster indexing than mobile
+- Cannot currently modify face groupings (view only)
+- Face grouping management must be done on mobile
+
+### Web (web.ente.io)
+- ML features not available
+- Basic search only (date, file name, description, album)
+
+## Works Offline
+
+Once your photos have been indexed, both face recognition and magic search work completely offline. The initial indexing requires downloading your photos (which is faster over WiFi), but after that all searches happen locally on your device without requiring an internet connection.

+title: Magic search
+description: Search your photos using natural language with Ente's on-device AI-powered magic search
+---
+
+# Magic Search
+
+Magic search lets you find photos using natural language descriptions of their content. Using on-device AI, you can search for objects, scenes, colors, and activities without your photos or search queries ever leaving your device.
+
+## What is Magic Search?
+
+Magic search uses AI models (specifically CLIP - Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to understand the content of your photos. This enables semantic search where you can describe what you're looking for in natural language, and the app will find matching photos.
+
+You can search for:
+- **Objects**: "car", "dog", "food", "bicycle", "book"
+- **Scenes**: "beach", "sunset", "mountain", "city skyline", "forest"
+- **Colors**: "red flowers", "blue car", "orange sunset"
+- **Activities**: "birthday cake", "swimming", "hiking", "cooking"
+- **Complex queries**: "the red motorcycle next to a fountain", "dog playing in snow"
+
+## How It Works
+
+### On-device AI
+
+Magic search runs entirely on your device:
+1. When you enable magic search, the app downloads your photos
+2. An AI model analyzes each photo locally on your device
+3. The model creates a semantic understanding of what's in each photo
+4. This understanding is stored as an encrypted index
+5. When you search, the query is matched against the index locally
+
+**Privacy guarantee**: Your photos, search queries, and AI-generated indexes never leave your device in unencrypted form. Ente's servers cannot see what's in your photos or what you're searching for.
+
+### CLIP-based understanding
+
+The AI model understands:
+- What objects appear in photos
+- What scenes or environments are depicted
+- Colors and visual attributes
+- Relationships between objects
+- Activities and actions
+
+This allows for flexible, natural language searches that go beyond simple keyword matching.
+
+## Enabling Magic Search
+
+Magic search is part of Ente's machine learning features. You must enable it manually (it's off by default).
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning`, enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**, and wait for indexing to complete.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning`, enable **Machine learning** and/or **Local indexing**, and monitor indexing progress.
+
+> **Note**: Magic search is not available on web.ente.io. You must use the mobile or desktop app.
+
+### Initial Indexing
+
+After enabling magic search:
+- The app downloads your photos to index them locally
+- Progress is shown as a percentage
+- This is faster over WiFi and on desktop computers
+- Once complete, you can immediately start using magic search
+
+**Indexing tips:**
+- For large libraries, enable on desktop first (faster indexing)
+- Enable before importing photos to avoid downloading them twice
+- Once indexed on one device, the indexes sync to other devices
+
+Learn more about [Machine learning](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning).
+
+## Using Magic Search
+
+### Simple searches
+
+Type natural language descriptions in the search bar:
+
+- **"sunset"** - finds photos of sunsets
+- **"beach"** - finds beach photos
+- **"dog"** - finds photos with dogs
+- **"food"** - finds photos of meals and food
+- **"car"** - finds photos containing cars
+
+### Complex searches
+
+Magic search understands more complex, descriptive queries:
+
+- **"red car"** - finds photos of red-colored cars
+- **"dog playing in snow"** - finds photos matching this description
+- **"birthday cake with candles"** - finds relevant celebration photos
+- **"mountain landscape"** - finds scenic mountain photos
+- **"night city"** - finds urban nighttime photos
+
+### Search best practices
+
+**Be descriptive:**
+- More specific queries often work better
+- Try variations if the first query doesn't return what you want
+
+**Combine terms:**
+- Use multiple descriptive words: "red flower garden"
+- Add color, setting, or context: "beach sunset orange sky"
+
+**Try different phrasings:**
+- If "car" doesn't work well, try "automobile" or "vehicle"
+- Use common, clear terms rather than very specific jargon
+
+**Use with other search types:**
+- Combine magic search with date filters
+- Search within specific albums
+- Use alongside face recognition to find photos of people doing specific activities
+
+## Search by Descriptions
+
+Magic search works even better when combined with descriptions (captions) you've added to photos.
+
+### Adding descriptions to photos
+
+**On mobile and desktop:**
+1. Open a photo
+2. Tap the info button (i)
+3. Enter your description or caption
+4. Save
+
+Your descriptions become searchable, making it easy to find photos you've documented with specific details, memories, or context.
+
+**Example**: Add "Sarah's graduation ceremony at the park" as a description, and you can later search for any of those terms to find the photo.

+
+## What Content Can Be Detected
+
+### Objects
+Cars, dogs, cats, bicycles, books, phones, computers, furniture, plants, flowers, trees, food items, drinks, and many more everyday objects.
+
+### Scenes and environments
+Beach, mountain, forest, city, park, garden, indoor/outdoor settings, architectural features, natural landscapes.
+
+### Colors and visual attributes
+Basic colors (red, blue, green, etc.), lighting conditions (night, day, sunset), weather conditions.
+
+### Activities
+Eating, swimming, hiking, cooking, reading, celebrations, sports, and other common activities (detection varies by photo clarity).
+
+### Limitations
+
+Magic search works best with:
+- Clear, well-lit photos
+- Common objects and scenes
+- Standard perspectives
+
+It may struggle with:
+- Very abstract or artistic photos
+- Highly specific or technical subjects
+- Very dark or unclear images
+- Unusual angles or perspectives
+
+## Privacy and Security
+
+Magic search maintains complete privacy:
+
+- **On-device processing**: All AI analysis happens on your device
+- **Encrypted indexes**: Search indexes are encrypted before syncing
+- **No server access**: Ente's servers never see your photos or what's in them
+- **No queries sent**: Your search queries stay on your device
+- **Not used for training**: Your photos are never used to train AI models
+- **No third parties**: No data is shared with any third party services
+
+Your magic search data is as private and secure as your photos themselves.
+
+Learn more in [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#ml-privacy).
+
+## Works Offline
+
+Once your photos have been indexed, magic search works completely offline:
+- Search without an internet connection
+- All processing happens locally
+- No data sent to servers
+- Instant search results
+
+The initial indexing requires downloading your photos (which is faster over WiFi), but after that magic search works without an internet connection.
+
+## Language Support
+
+Magic search understands queries in multiple languages. The CLIP model has been trained on diverse linguistic data, allowing it to understand common terms in many languages.
+
+However, English queries typically work best due to the model's training data distribution.
+
+## Technical Details
+
+### CLIP model
+
+Magic search uses CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), an AI model developed by OpenAI that understands both images and text. This allows the model to:
+- Associate natural language descriptions with visual content
+- Understand semantic similarity between queries and images
+- Generalize to objects and concepts it hasn't explicitly seen
+
+### Index storage
+
+- Indexes are stored locally on your device
+- They're encrypted before being synced to other devices
+- Much smaller than the original photos
+- Sync automatically using the same encryption as your photos
+
+## Combining with Other Search Features
+
+Magic search works well alongside Ente's other search capabilities:
+
+### With face recognition
+- Search for "birthday" to find celebration photos
+- Then filter by a specific person's name
+- Find photos of people doing specific activities
+
+### With date search
+- Use magic search to find "beach" photos
+- Then filter by "Summer 2023"
+- Narrow down to specific time periods
+
+### With album search
+- Search within a specific album
+- Use magic search to find particular types of photos
+- Organize and find content more efficiently
+
+### With location tags
+- Tag locations like "Paris"
+- Use magic search within that location for "Eiffel Tower" or "cafe"

+title: Map and Location
+description: View photos on a map and organize them with custom location tags in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Map and Location
+
+Ente provides two complementary ways to explore and organize your photos by location: **Map view** for visualizing photos based on GPS coordinates, and **Location tags** for creating custom location labels.
+
+## Map View
+
+Map view lets you explore your photos on an interactive map based on the GPS location data embedded in your photos.
+
+### How it works
+
+Photos that have GPS coordinates in their metadata will automatically appear on the map. You can:
+- See all your photos on a global map
+- Zoom into specific locations
+- View photos from specific albums on the map
+- Explore where your photos were taken around the world
+
+> **Note**: Only photos with GPS location data in their metadata will appear on the map. Photos without location data (like screenshots, downloaded images, or photos taken with location services disabled) won't be shown.
+
+### Enable map view
+
+The map feature can be enabled or disabled in your app settings.
+
+**On mobile:**
+
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced` and use the toggle switch to turn the map feature on or off.
+
+**On desktop:**
+
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Map` and toggle the map settings on or off.
+
+### View photos on the map
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Tap the search icon at the bottom right
+2. Tap the globe icon (Your map) in the location section
+3. Explore your photos on the map
+
+**View a specific album on the map:**
+1. Open the album
+2. Tap the three dots in the top right corner
+3. Select **Map**
+4. View only that album's photos on the map
+
+**On desktop:**
+Access map view through the search interface or album menus, similar to mobile.
+
+### Privacy
+
+Your location data is end-to-end encrypted, just like your photos. When you view photos on the map:
+- Map view uses encrypted location coordinates stored with your photos
+- Ente's servers cannot see where your photos were taken
+- All location-based searches happen locally on your device
+
+Learn more in [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy).
+
+## Location Tags
+
+Location tags let you create custom location labels to organize and search for photos by place, regardless of whether they have GPS data.
+
+### What are location tags?
+
+Location tags are custom labels you create to organize photos by location. Unlike map view (which relies on GPS data), location tags let you:
+- Create tags like "Home", "Office", "Paris Trip"
+- Define a center point and radius for each location
+- Find photos within specific areas
+- Tag photos that don't have GPS coordinates
+
+### How location tags differ from map view
+
+**Map view:**
+- Shows photos based on GPS coordinates embedded in photo metadata
+- Displays exact locations where photos were taken
+- Only shows photos that have location data
+
+**Location tags:**
+- Custom labels you create and manage
+- You define the center point and radius
+- Can include photos without GPS data
+- Useful for organizing photos from frequent places
+
+**When to use each:**
+- Use **map view** to explore where your photos were taken geographically
+- Use **location tags** to organize photos by meaningful places (home, work, vacation destinations)
+
+### Create location tags
+
+**From a photo:**
+1. Open a photo
+2. Click **Info** (i)
+3. Select **Add Location**
+4. Enter the location name and define a radius
+
+**From the search tab:**
+1. Open the search tab
+2. Click **Add new** in the location tags section
+3. Select a photo as the center point for the location tag
+4. Enter the location name and define a radius
+
+The app will automatically cluster photos falling within that radius under your specified location tag.
+
+### Benefits of location tags
+
+- **Privacy-focused**: All searches run locally on your device
+- **Encrypted**: Location tags are stored end-to-end encrypted
+- **Flexible**: Tag photos with or without GPS data
+- **Organized**: Easy to find photos from frequent places like home, office, and vacation spots
+- **Searchable**: Quickly find all photos from a tagged location
+
+## Common Questions
+
+### Why don't all my photos appear on the map?
+
+Photos appear on the map only if they have GPS location data in their metadata. Photos may not appear if:
+- Location services were disabled when the photo was taken
+- Location data was stripped during export/transfer
+- The photo is a screenshot or downloaded image
+- The device's GPS was disabled
+
+You can manually add location data to photos. See [Metadata and Editing FAQ](/photos/faq/metadata-and-editing#add-location).
+
+### Can I add photos to the map that don't have GPS data?
+
+The map view itself only shows photos with GPS data. However, you can use **location tags** to organize photos by location regardless of whether they have GPS coordinates. Create a location tag for a specific place, and you can include any photos in that tag.
+
+### Is my location data sent to Ente servers?
+
+No. Your location data is end-to-end encrypted, just like your photos. Ente's servers cannot see:
+- Where your photos were taken
+- Your location tags
+- Map view usage
+
+All location-based searches happen locally on your device.
+
+### Can I view all my albums on the map at once?
+
+Yes! By default, the map view shows photos from all your albums. You can also view a specific album on the map by opening that album and selecting "Map" from the menu.

-# Sharing
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-Ente supports end-to-end encrypted sharing of your photos and videos.
+The **Sharing** feature guide has moved to:
 
-This allows you to share your photos and videos with only the people you want,
-without them being visible to anybody else. The files remain encrypted at all
-times, and only the people you have shared with get the decryption keys.
+## Sharing Features
+- [Sharing feature guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/share) - Complete guide to sharing albums with Ente users and via public links
 
-- If the person you want to share with is already on Ente, you can share an
-  album with them by entering their email address.
+## Related topics
+- [Sharing FAQ](/photos/faq/sharing-and-collaboration#sharing) - Common questions about sharing
+- [How does sharing work?](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#sharing-encryption) - Security and encryption details
+- [Public links](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/public-links) - Share with anyone via links
 
-- If they are not already on Ente, you can send them an invite and then share
-  with them after they've signed up.
-
-- Alternatively, you can create public links to share albums with people who are
-  not on Ente.
-
-With public links, the files are still end-to-end encrypted, so the sharing is
-still secure. Note that the decryption keys are part of the public link so keep
-in mind that anybody with the link will be able to share it with others.
-
-Both shared albums and public links allow [collaboration](collaborate).
-
-## Links
-
-You can create links to your albums by opening an album and clicking on the
-Share icon. They are publicly accessible by anyone who you share the link with.
-They don't need an app or account.
-
-These links can be password protected, or set to expire after a while.
-
-You can read more about the features supported by Links
-[here](https://ente.io/blog/powerful-links/).
-
-## Albums
-
-If your loved ones are already on Ente, you can share an album with their
-registered email address.
-
-If they are your partner, you can share your `Camera` folder on Android, or
-`Recents` on iOS. Whenever you click new photos, they will automatically be
-accessible on your partner's device.
-
-## Collaboration
-
-You can allow other Ente users to add photos to your album. This is a great way
-for you to build an album together with someone. You can control access to the
-same album - someone can be added as a `Collaborator`, while someone else as a
-`Viewer`.
-
-If you wish to collect photos from folks who are not Ente, you can do so with
-our Links. Simply tick the box that says "Allow uploads", and anyone who has
-access to the link will be able to add photos to your album.
-
-## Organization
-
-You can favorite items that have been shared with you, and organize them into
-your own albums.
-
-When you perform these operations, Ente will create a hard copy of these items,
-that you fully own. This means, these copied items will count against your
-storage space.
-
-We understand there are use cases where this approach will consume extra space
-(for eg. if you are organizing photos of a family member). We chose hard copies
-as a first version to avoid complexities regarding the ownership of shared
-items, in case the original owner were to delete it from their own library.
-
-We plan to tackle these complexities in the future, by copying a reference to
-the item that was shared, instead of the actual file, so that your storage will
-only get consumed if the original owner deletes it from their library. If this
-sounds useful to you, please participate in
-[this discussion](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/790).
-
-## Technical details
-
-More details, including technical aspect about how the sharing features were
-implemented, are in various blog posts announcing these features.
-
-- [Collaborative albums](https://ente.io/blog/collaborative-albums)
-
-- [Collect photos from people not on ente](https://ente.io/blog/collect-photos)
-
-- [Shareable links for albums](https://ente.io/blog/shareable-links),
-  [and their underlying technical implementation](https://ente.io/blog/building-shareable-links).
-  Since then, we have also added the ability to password protect public links,
-  and configure a duration after which the link will automatically expire.
-
-We are now working on the other requested features around sharing, including
-comments and reactions.
-
-## Limitations
+---
 
-Sharing is only available to paid customers. This limitation safeguards against
-potential platform abuse.

+title: Collaboration
+description: Collaborate with others using shared albums and collect photos from events
+---
+
+# Collaboration
+
+Ente enables you to collaborate with others in two ways: by sharing albums with other Ente users, or by collecting photos from anyone via public links.
+
+## Collaborating with Ente users
+
+Collaborative albums allow multiple Ente users to contribute photos to the same shared album. This is perfect for ongoing collaboration with family or friends who use Ente.
+
+### How it works
+
+- **Album owner**: The person who created the album
+- **Participants**: Added by email address (must have Ente accounts)
+- **Permissions**: Owner can assign Viewer or Collaborator roles
+- **Storage**: Each photo's storage counts towards whoever uploaded it
+
+### Adding collaborators
+
+1. Open the album you want to share
+2. Tap/click the Share icon
+3. Select "Share with Ente users" or enter email addresses
+4. Choose permissions (Viewer or Collaborator)
+5. Send the invitation
+
+Recipients receive a notification and can access the shared album from their Ente app.
+
+### Permissions explained
+
+**Viewers can:**
+- View all photos in the album
+- Download photos
+- Add photos to their own albums (creates a copy)
+
+**Collaborators can:**
+- Everything viewers can do, plus:
+- Add new photos and videos to the shared album
+- Remove photos they uploaded
+- Comment and react (coming soon)
+
+**Album owners can:**
+- Everything collaborators can do, plus:
+- Add or remove participants
+- Change permissions for existing participants
+- Remove any photo from the album
+- Delete photos they own
+- Delete the entire album
+
+### Storage in collaborative albums
+
+Storage is counted towards the person who uploaded each photo:
+
+- When a collaborator adds a photo, it counts towards **their** storage quota
+- Since collaborators usually already have the photo in their account, they effectively don't pay extra
+- The album owner does not pay for photos uploaded by collaborators
+- Storage is only counted once, even if the photo appears in multiple albums
+
+### When collaborators leave
+
+When a collaborator is removed from a shared album (or when they leave voluntarily):
+- Any photos they uploaded will also be removed from the album
+- Those photos remain in the collaborator's own account
+- Photos uploaded by other participants remain in the album
+- The removed collaborator loses access to view the album
+
+### Platform availability
+
+**Mobile apps (iOS and Android):**
+- Full support for collaborative albums
+- Can view, add, and manage photos
+
+**Web and desktop:**
+- Currently view-only mode for collaborative albums
+- We're actively working on adding full collaboration support
+
+## Collecting photos from anyone
+
+Collect links allow you to gather photos from people who don't have Ente accounts. This is perfect for collecting event photos from large groups where not everyone uses Ente.
+
+### What are collect links?
+
+Collect links are public links with the "Allow adding photos" option enabled. Anyone with the link can view existing photos and add their own through their web browser - no Ente account or app installation required.
+
+**Common use cases:**
+- Wedding photos from guests
+- Birthday party memories
+- Vacation trip photos
+- Conference or event photos
+- Any group gathering where you want photos from everyone
+
+### How to create a collect link
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the album you want to use for collecting photos
+2. Tap the Share icon in the top right corner
+3. Select "Collect photos"
+4. Tap "Copy link"
+5. Share the link with anyone you want to collect photos from
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+1. Open the album
+2. Click the share album icon
+3. Select "Collect photos"
+4. Click "Copy link"
+5. Share the link with others
+
+Anyone with the link can view existing photos and add their own through their web browser. They can also download photos if you haven't disabled downloads.
+
+### Storage for collected photos
+
+All photos added to your album through a collect link count towards **your storage quota** as the album owner.
+
+When someone adds a photo via a collect link:
+- The photo is stored in your account
+- You can view, download, and manage it like any other photo
+- You can remove collected photos at any time
+- Contributors cannot delete photos after uploading
+
+### Managing collect links
+
+**Set limits and protections:**
+- **Password protection**: Require a password to access the link
+- **Link expiry**: Set when the link should stop working
+- **Device limits**: Limit how many devices can access the link
+- **Disable downloads**: Prevent people from downloading original quality photos
+- **Disable uploads**: Convert to view-only by turning off "Allow adding photos"
+
+**Stop collecting photos:**
+1. **Remove the link**: Delete the public link from your sharing settings
+2. **Disable uploads**: Edit link settings and turn off "Allow adding photos"
+3. **Change to view-only**: Convert the collect link to a regular public link
+
+**View contributors:**
+Currently, you cannot see who added which photos to a collect link. All collected photos appear in the album without attribution. We're considering adding this feature based on user feedback.
+
+## Comparison
+
+| Feature | Collaborative Albums | Collect Links |
+|---------|---------------------|---------------|
+| **Participants need Ente account** | Yes | No |
+| **Access method** | Email invitation | Link |
+| **Who pays for storage** | Each uploader | Album owner |
+| **Best for** | Ongoing collaboration with Ente users | One-time collection from large groups |
+| **Platform support** | Mobile (full), Web/Desktop (view only) | All platforms via web browser |
+| **Can set upload limits** | No (trust-based) | Yes (password, expiry, device limits) |

+title: Custom domains
+description: Use your own domain when sharing photos and videos stored in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Custom domains
+
+Custom domains allow you to serve your public links with your own personalized domain.
+
+For example, if I have an Ente album and wish to share it with my friends, I can open the album's sharing settings and create a public link. When I copy this link, it will be of the form of
+
+```
+https://albums.ente.io/?t=...
+```
+
+The custom domains feature allows you to instead create a link that uses your own domain, say
+
+```
+https://pics.example.org/?t=...
+```
+
+You don't need to run any servers or manage any services, Ente will still host and serve your album for you, the only thing that changes is that you can serve your links using your personalized domain.
+
+## Availability
+
+The custom domains feature requires the ability to publicly share albums which for abuse prevention reasons can only be done by people with an active Ente subscription.
+
+## Setup
+
+The setup involves two steps:
+
+1. Letting Ente know about the domain you wish to use for serving your public links
+2. Updating your DNS settings to point your domain (or subdomain) to **my.ente.io**
+
+For people who are comfortable with changing DNS settings on their domain provider, this entire process is very simple will take a minute. For people who are not comfortable with changing DNS, we will provide a more detailed breakdown below.
+
+Let's dive in.
+
+To make the process concrete, let's assume we're trying to use _pics.example.org_ as our custom domain. Note that there is no restriction to use a subdomain, a top level domain can be used as a custom domain too. That is, either of _example.org_ or _subdomain.example.org_ is fine, Ente will work with both.
+
+### Step 1 - Link your domain
+
+The first step is to let Ente know about the domain or subdomain you wish to use by linking it to your account.
+
+> [!WARNING]
+>
+> Currently (Sep 2025) the ability to link a custom domain is only present in Ente's web app, [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io).
+
+Head over to Settings > Preferences > Custom domains, in the domain field enter "pics.example.org" (replace with your subdomain) and press "Save". That's it. The linking is done.
+
+### Step 2 - Add DNS entry
+
+The second step is to add a CNAME entry in your DNS provider that forwards requests for pics.example.org (replace with your subdomain) to **my.ente.io**.
+
+Specifically, you need to add a `CNAME record` from the domain (or subdomain) of your choice to `my.ente.io`. You can leave the `TTL` at its default.
+
+| Record Type |            Name            |        Value | TTL            |
+| ----------- | :------------------------: | -----------: | -------------- |
+| CNAME       | Your subdomain, e.g `pics` | `my.ente.io` | Auto (default) |
+
+The exact steps for doing this depend on the DNS provider that you're using.
+
+> Your DNS provider usually is the service from which you bought your domain. The domain name seller will provide some sort of an admin panel where you can configure your DNS settings.
+
+As concrete examples, here is how this step would look for Cloudflare:
+
+![Adding a CNAME for custom domain in Cloudflare](cf.png)
+
+Note that orange proxy option is off. And here is how it would look for Namecheap:
+
+![Adding a CNAME for custom domain in Namecheap](nc.png)
+
+> [!NOTE]
+>
+> The examples are using "pics" as the subdomain, but that's just an example, you can use anything you like (or use "@" if you'd like to use the root domain itself).
+
+The time it takes for DNS records to update is dependent on your DNS provider. Usually the changes should start reflecting within a few minutes, and should almost always reflect within an hour.
+
+Once the DNS changes have been applied, then you can take any public link to your shared albums, replace `albums.ente.io` with your choice (e.g. `pics.example.org`), and the link will still work.
+
+You don't need to do this manually though, the apps will do it for you. More on this in the next section. But first, some troubleshooting tips.
+
+### Troubleshooting
+
+If your domain is not working, go through the following checklist.
+
+- The CNAME should be from your domain to my.ente.io, not the other way around. That is, `pics.example.org => my.ente.io`.
+
+- If you're using Cloudflare DNS, make sure that the "Orange" proxy status toggle is off, and the Proxy status is the "Grey" DNS only.
+
+## Using
+
+Using is trivial. When you open an album's sharing options and copy the link to it, Ente will automatically copy the link that uses your configured domain.
+
+> [!WARNING]
+>
+> Currently (Sep 2025) the ability to automatically substitute your custom domain is present in Ente's web and mobile apps, but not in the desktop app (The next desktop version to be released will have that ability too).
+
+
+### Limitations
+
+#### Trip albums
+
+Public albums that use the Trip layout feature are not yet supported on custom domains. When someone tries to access a Trip album through your custom domain, they will be automatically redirected to the default `albums.ente.io` domain. Regular albums continue to work perfectly on your custom domain.
+
+## Unsetting
+
+To stop using your custom domain, we need to undo the two steps we did during setup.
+
+1. Unlink your domain in Ente. This can be done just by going to Settings > Preferences > Custom Domains, clearing the value in the "Domain" input and pressing "Update".
+
+2. Remove the CNAME record you added during setup in your DNS provider.
+
+## Implementation
+
+Our engineers also wrote [explainer](https://ente.io/blog/custom-domains/) of how this works behind the scenes.

+title: Embed albums
+description: Embed your Ente Photos albums on your own website
+---
+
+# Embed albums
+
+The embed feature allows you to display your Ente photo albums directly on your own website or blog using an iframe.
+
+For example, if you have a public Ente album that you'd like to showcase on your website, you can embed it just like you would embed a YouTube video. Visitors can browse through your photos without leaving your site.
+
+## Availability
+
+The embed feature works with any public album link. Since creating public albums requires an active Ente subscription for abuse prevention, embedding also requires a subscription.
+
+## How to embed
+
+### Easy method - Using the web app
+
+The simplest way to get the embed code is directly from Ente's web app:
+
+1. Open the album in [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io)
+2. Open the album's sharing settings
+3. Create a public link (if you haven't already)
+4. Open the link settings ("Manage link")
+5. Click the "Copy embed HTML" button
+
+This copies ready-to-use iframe code that you can paste directly into your website's HTML.
+
+### Manual method
+
+Alternatively, you can create the embed code manually:
+
+#### Step 1 - Create a public link
+
+First, you need to create a public link for the album you want to embed:
+
+1. Open the album in Ente (web or mobile app)
+2. Open the album's sharing settings
+3. Create a public link
+4. Copy the link (it will look like `https://albums.ente.io/?t=...#...`)
+
+#### Step 2 - Add iframe to your website
+
+Add an iframe to your HTML with the public link as the source, replacing `albums.ente.io` with `embed.ente.io`:
+
+```html
+<iframe
+    src="https://embed.ente.io/?t=...#..."
+    width="800"
+    height="600"
+    frameborder="0"
+    allowfullscreen
+>
+</iframe>
+```
+
+> [!NOTE]
+>
+> If you're using a custom domain for your public links, then replace your custom domain with `embed.ente.io`. The easy method will automatically do this for you.
+
+### Customizing the embed
+
+You can customize the appearance by adjusting the iframe attributes:
+
+- `width` and `height`: Control the size of the embed
+- `allowfullscreen`: Allows viewers to open photos in fullscreen mode
+- You can use percentage values for responsive sizing: `width="100%"`
+
+#### Example with responsive sizing
+
+```html
+<div
+    style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"
+>
+    <iframe
+        src="https://embed.ente.io/?t=...#..."
+        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
+        frameborder="0"
+        allowfullscreen
+    >
+    </iframe>
+</div>
+```
+
+## Features
+
+The embedded album viewer includes:
+
+- Thumbnail grid view
+- Full-size image viewer with navigation
+- Video playback support
+- Fullscreen mode (when `allowfullscreen` is set)
+- Password protection (if enabled on the album)
+- Automatic updates when you add new photos to the album
+
+## Privacy and security
+
+- The embed uses the same encryption and security as regular Ente albums
+- Only photos in the public album are accessible through the embed
+- If you delete the public link, the embed will stop working
+- Password-protected albums will prompt for the password within the iframe
+
+Note that by putting the embed link in a webpage, you're making it public for anyone who can view the page, including search engines that can index your webpages. This isn't any different from putting the public link in your webpage or sharing it in a public forum, but it is good to call this out.
+
+The album is still end to end encrypted in a manner that Ente does not have access to the key to decrypt the album. If you're curious how this works technically, then you can find [implementation details here](https://ente.io/blog/building-shareable-links/).

+title: Public links
+description: Share photos via links without requiring Ente accounts
+---
+
+# Public links
+
+Ente lets you share your photos via links that anyone can access without an app or account. The contents remain end-to-end encrypted, with decryption keys embedded in the link.
+
+## Creating public links
+
+You can create public links in two ways: from an existing album, or by selecting specific photos.
+
+### From an album
+
+Share an entire album via a public link:
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Open the album you want to share
+2. Tap the Share icon
+3. Select "Create link" or "Share link"
+4. Configure link options (optional)
+5. Tap "Copy link" and share it with anyone
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+1. Open the album
+2. Click the share icon
+3. Select "Create link"
+4. Configure link options (optional)
+5. Click "Copy link" and share it
+
+### Quick link (from selected photos)
+
+Create a shareable link without creating an album first:
+
+**On mobile:**
+1. Long press to select one or more photos
+2. Tap the share icon
+3. Select "Create quick link"
+4. Configure options
+5. Share the link
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+1. Select one or more photos
+2. Click the share icon
+3. Select "Create quick link"
+4. Configure options
+5. Share the link
+
+**How it works:** Ente creates a special hidden album behind the scenes and adds your selected photos to it. The link works exactly like a regular public link - recipients see an album with the photos you selected.
+
+**Managing quick links:**
+- View all quick links in the Sharing tab under "Quick links"
+- Quick links can be converted to regular albums if needed
+- Removing a link doesn't delete the photos
+
+## Link features
+
+Public links support powerful security and control features:
+
+### Password protection
+
+Add a password to your link for an extra layer of security. Recipients must enter the correct password to view photos.
+
+**When to use:**
+- Sharing sensitive content
+- Limiting access to a specific group
+- Adding security beyond link secrecy
+
+### Link expiry
+
+Set an expiration date for your link. After this time, the link automatically stops working.
+
+**When to use:**
+- Temporary event photo sharing
+- Time-limited access
+- Automatic cleanup of old shares
+
+**Options:**
+- Custom date/time
+- Common presets (7 days, 30 days, etc.)
+- Can be extended or changed later
+
+### Device limits
+
+Limit how many devices can access the link. This prevents the link from being widely forwarded.
+
+**When to use:**
+- Sharing with a known small group
+- Preventing viral spread of the link
+- Adding accountability to sharing
+
+### Prevent downloads
+
+Disable the option to download original quality photos. Recipients can still view photos and take screenshots, but can't download the original files.
+
+**When to use:**
+- Protecting professional work
+- Watermarked preview sharing
+- Limited distribution control
+
+**Note:** This doesn't prevent screenshots or screen recording, but does make it harder for recipients to get high-quality copies.
+
+### Allow adding photos (Collect mode)
+
+Enable photo uploads through the link. Anyone with the link can add photos to the album via web browser - no Ente account needed.
+
+**When to use:**
+- Collecting event photos from guests
+- Group trip photo gathering
+- Wedding or party photo collection
+
+When this option is enabled, the link becomes a "collect link". All photos added through the link count towards your storage quota.
+
+Learn more in the [Collaboration guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration).
+
+### Custom domains
+
+Use your own domain instead of `albums.ente.io` for your public links.
+
+For example: `https://pics.example.org/?t=...` instead of `https://albums.ente.io/?t=...`
+
+Learn more in the [Custom domains guide](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/custom-domains/).
+
+## Managing links
+
+### View all your links
+
+**On mobile:**
+- Go to the Sharing tab (bottom navigation)
+- See "Shared albums" and "Quick links" sections
+
+**On web/desktop:**
+- Open the sidebar
+- Click "Sharing" to see all shared links
+
+### Edit link settings
+
+1. Find the link in your sharing list
+2. Tap/click the three dots menu
+3. Select "Edit link settings"
+4. Modify password, expiry, device limits, or other options
+5. Save changes
+
+Changes apply immediately - anyone accessing the link will see the updated settings.
+
+### Delete a link
+
+1. Find the link in your sharing list
+2. Tap/click the three dots menu
+3. Select "Remove link"
+4. Confirm deletion
+
+Deleting a link makes it immediately inaccessible. The photos in the album remain in your account.
+
+### Convert quick link to regular album
+
+Quick links create hidden albums. You can convert them to regular albums:
+
+1. Go to Sharing tab
+2. Find the quick link under "Quick links"
+3. Tap/click the three dots menu
+4. Select "Convert to album"
+
+The album becomes a regular album in your Albums tab, and the link continues to work.
+
+## How encryption works
+
+Public links are end-to-end encrypted, but with an important caveat:
+
+**What's encrypted:**
+- All photo and video files
+- Photo metadata and album information
+- Everything is encrypted before leaving your device
+
+**The security trade-off:**
+- Decryption keys are embedded in the link (in the URL fragment after #)
+- Anyone with the link can decrypt and view the content
+- The keys never reach Ente's servers (URL fragments aren't sent to servers)
+
+**For sensitive content:**
+- Use password protection for an additional security layer
+- Set link expiration to limit exposure
+- Use device limits to prevent wide sharing
+- Consider sharing albums directly with Ente users instead
+
+> Implementation details have been documented in our blog post: [Building shareable links](https://ente.io/blog/building-shareable-links/).
+
+## Availability
+
+Public links (including collect links and quick links) are only available to paid customers. This limitation helps safeguard against platform abuse.
+
+**Free users can:**
+- View public links shared with them
+- Add photos to collect links shared with them
+- Receive shared albums from other Ente users
+
+**To create public links:**
+- Upgrade to any paid plan
+- All paid tiers have full sharing capabilities

+title: Share
+description: Securely share photos and videos stored in Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Sharing
+
+Ente makes it easy to share your photos and videos while maintaining end-to-end encryption and privacy. You have complete control over who can view, add, or download your shared content.
+
+## How sharing works
+
+Your photos and videos remain encrypted at all times. When you share content, only the people you share with receive the decryption keys needed to view your photos. Ente's servers never have access to your unencrypted files.
+
+## Ways to share
+
+### Share with Ente users
+
+If the person you want to share with has an Ente account, you can share an album directly with them by entering their email address. They'll receive a notification and can access the shared album from their Ente app.
+
+**To invite someone to Ente**: Send them an invite from the app. Once they create an account, you can share albums with them.
+
+### Share via public links
+
+Create shareable links that anyone can access without an Ente account. Public links are perfect for sharing with large groups or people who don't use Ente.
+
+**Security note**: While files remain end-to-end encrypted, the decryption keys are embedded in the link. Anyone with the link can view the content and potentially share the link with others. Use password protection and expiration settings for sensitive content.
+
+Both shared albums and public links support [collaboration](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/collaboration), allowing recipients to add their own photos.
+
+## Links
+
+You can create links to your albums by opening an album and clicking on the
+Share icon. They are publicly accessible by anyone who you share the link with.
+They don't need an app or account.
+
+These links can be password protected, or set to expire after a while.
+
+You can read more about the features supported by Links
+[here](https://ente.io/blog/powerful-links/).
+
+## Albums
+
+If your loved ones are already on Ente, you can share an album with their
+registered email address.
+
+If they are your partner, you can share your `Camera` folder on Android, or
+`Recents` on iOS. Whenever you click new photos, they will automatically be
+accessible on your partner's device.
+
+## Collaboration
+
+You can allow other Ente users to add photos to your album. This is a great way
+for you to build an album together with someone. You can control access to the
+same album - someone can be added as a `Collaborator`, while someone else as a
+`Viewer`.
+
+If you wish to collect photos from folks who are not Ente, you can do so with
+our Links. Simply tick the box that says "Allow uploads", and anyone who has
+access to the link will be able to add photos to your album.
+
+## Organization
+
+You can favorite items that have been shared with you, and organize them into
+your own albums.
+
+When you perform these operations, Ente will create a hard copy of these items,
+that you fully own. This means, these copied items will count against your
+storage space.
+
+We understand there are use cases where this approach will consume extra space
+(for eg. if you are organizing photos of a family member). We chose hard copies
+as a first version to avoid complexities regarding the ownership of shared
+items, in case the original owner were to delete it from their own library.
+
+We plan to tackle these complexities in the future, by copying a reference to
+the item that was shared, instead of the actual file, so that your storage will
+only get consumed if the original owner deletes it from their library. If this
+sounds useful to you, please participate in
+[this discussion](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/790).
+
+## Technical details
+
+More details, including technical aspect about how the sharing features were
+implemented, are in various blog posts announcing these features.
+
+- [Collaborative albums](https://ente.io/blog/collaborative-albums)
+
+- [Collect photos from people not on ente](https://ente.io/blog/collect-photos)
+
+- [Shareable links for albums](https://ente.io/blog/shareable-links),
+  [and their underlying technical implementation](https://ente.io/blog/building-shareable-links).
+  Since then, we have also added the ability to password protect public links,
+  and configure a duration after which the link will automatically expire.
+
+We are now working on the other requested features around sharing, including
+comments and reactions.
+
+## Limitations
+
+Sharing is only available to paid customers. This limitation safeguards against
+potential platform abuse.

+title: CLI (Command Line Interface)
+description: Ente's command-line tool for advanced users
+---
+
+# CLI (Command Line Interface)
+
+The Ente CLI is a command-line tool for advanced users that provides programmatic access to Ente Photos. It's particularly useful for automation, server environments, and power users who prefer terminal-based tools.
+
+## What is the CLI?
+
+The Ente CLI allows you to:
+- Export your entire library or specific albums to local storage
+- Set up automated exports with cron jobs
+- Sync data to NAS or other storage systems
+- Perform bulk operations programmatically
+
+## Why use the CLI?
+
+The CLI is particularly useful for:
+- **Regular automated backups** to local/NAS storage
+- **Server-to-server transfers** without a GUI
+- **Power users** who prefer command-line tools
+- **Scheduled tasks** using cron or similar schedulers
+- **Scripting and automation** workflows
+
+## Installation
+
+Ente's CLI is distributed directly over [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0).
+
+**Steps:**
+1. Go to the [CLI releases page](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0)
+2. Download the appropriate version for your platform:
+   - Linux (x64, ARM64)
+   - macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
+   - Windows (x64)
+3. Follow the installation instructions in the [CLI README](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme)
+
+## Basic usage
+
+### Authentication
+
+Before using the CLI, you need to authenticate:
+
+```bash
+ente account login
+```
+
+This will prompt for your email and password, then store your session securely.
+
+### Exporting photos
+
+The CLI supports **incremental exports**, downloading only new or changed files:
+
+```bash
+# Export all photos
+ente export
+
+# Export to specific directory
+ente export --dir /path/to/backup
+
+# Export specific album
+ente export --album "Album Name"
+```
+
+**Key features:**
+- Incremental exports (only new/changed files)
+- Gracefully handles interruptions
+- Safe to stop and restart without re-downloading
+- Preserves album structure and metadata
+
+For complete command documentation, see the [CLI README](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme).
+
+## Automated exports
+
+### Setting up cron jobs
+
+You can automate exports using cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
+
+**Example cron job for daily export at 2 AM:**
+```bash
+0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/ente export --dir /nas/ente-backup
+```
+
+**Steps to set up:**
+1. Open crontab editor: `crontab -e`
+2. Add the cron job line
+3. Save and exit
+4. Verify with: `crontab -l`
+
+### NAS sync setup
+
+The recommended approach for keeping NAS and Ente synced is to use the CLI to **pull data from Ente to your NAS**:
+
+**Setup:**
+1. Install the CLI on your NAS or a machine that can access it
+2. Authenticate the CLI with your Ente account
+3. Set up a cron job to run periodic exports
+4. Use the CLI's incremental export feature to keep data synced
+
+**Example for daily NAS sync:**
+```bash
+0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/ente export --dir /nas/ente-backup
+```
+
+**Important:** Two-way sync is not currently supported. The CLI only pulls data from Ente to local storage - changes to local files won't sync back to Ente.
+
+## Export details
+
+### Album structure preservation
+
+Exports maintain your exact album structure from Ente. Each album becomes a separate folder.
+
+### Metadata handling
+
+Metadata is exported as JSON files in the same format as Google Takeout, making it compatible with tools that support Google Takeout imports.
+
+**Format:**
+```
+photo.jpg
+metadata/photo.jpg.json
+```
+
+Learn more in the [Export feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/export).
+
+## CLI vs Desktop export
+
+| Feature | CLI | Desktop App |
+|---------|-----|-------------|
+| Platform | All platforms (terminal) | Desktop GUI |
+| Automation | ✅ Cron jobs, scripts | ✅ Continuous export |
+| Server use | ✅ Headless servers | ❌ Requires GUI |
+| Album selection | Command line flags | GUI settings |
+| Incremental | ✅ | ✅ |
+| Metadata | ✅ | ✅ |
+
+**When to use CLI:**
+- Server environments without GUI
+- Scheduled automated backups
+- Custom scripting workflows
+- Power users who prefer terminal
+
+**When to use Desktop:**
+- Visual interface preferred
+- Continuous background export
+- One-time setup without scripting
+
+## Source code and development
+
+The CLI is open source and part of the Ente project:
+- **Source code**: [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli)
+- **Documentation**: [CLI README](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme)
+- **Report issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/issues)
+
+You can review, contribute to, or extend the CLI for your specific needs.

+title: Video Streaming
+description: Stream your videos without downloading them first
+---
+
+# Video Streaming
+
+Video streaming is a beta feature that lets you watch videos without downloading the entire file first. Instead of downloading the full video, Ente generates a streamable version that supports instant playback and seeking.
+
+> **Note**: Video streaming is available in beta on mobile apps starting v0.9.98 and on desktop starting v1.7.13.
+
+## How it works
+
+When you enable video streaming, Ente generates streamable versions (HLS format) of your videos that support:
+- **Instant playback** - Start watching immediately without waiting for downloads
+- **Seeking/scrubbing** - Jump to any point in the video without downloading the whole file
+- **Automatic quality selection** - Optimized playback based on your connection
+
+### Technical details
+
+Streams are encrypted HLS files with a `.m3u8` playlist. Currently, Ente converts videos to:
+- Resolution: 720p
+- Bitrate: 2mbps
+- Format: H.264
+
+The generated stream is a single encrypted blob (AES encryption) while the playlist file (`.m3u8`) is separately encrypted using XChaCha20. Ente cannot read the contents, duration, or number of chunks within the generated stream due to encryption.
+
+## Enabling video streaming
+
+### On mobile
+
+1. Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Streamable videos`
+2. Enable the toggle
+
+**What happens next:**
+- Videos captured in the last 30 days will start processing
+- Both local and remote videos will be processed
+- This may consume bandwidth for downloading remote files and uploading generated streams
+- Processing continues in the background
+
+### On desktop
+
+1. Open `Settings > Preferences > Streamable videos`
+2. Enable the toggle
+
+**What happens next:**
+- New uploads will automatically generate streams
+- All existing previously uploaded videos will be processed
+- Stream generation is CPU intensive and happens in the background
+- Click the search bar to see "Processing videos..." status
+
+## Viewing video streams
+
+### On mobile
+
+- Open `Settings > Backup > Backup status` to see processing status
+- Processed videos show a green play button
+- Tap processed videos to see a `Play stream` button
+- Click the `Info` icon within a video to see stream details
+
+### On desktop and web
+
+- Desktop and web automatically play streaming versions if available
+- The quality selector shows "Auto" when playing a stream
+
+## Storage implications
+
+**While this feature is in beta**, streams do not count against your storage quota.
+
+This may change in the future. If it does, we will provide an option to choose:
+1. Original videos only
+2. Compressed streams only
+3. Both (original + streams)

-# Watch folders
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-The Ente desktop app allows you to "watch" a folder on your computer for any
-changes, creating a one-way background sync from folders on your computer to
-Ente albums. This is intended to automate your photo management and backup.
+The **Watch Folders** feature guide has moved to:
 
-By using the "Watch folders" option in the sidebar, you can tell the desktop app
-which are the folders that you want to watch for changes. The app will then
-automatically upload new files added to these folders to the corresponding ente
-album (it will also upload them initially). And if a file is deleted locally,
-then the corresponding Ente file will also be automatically moved to
-uncategorized.
+## Watch Folders
+- [Watch folders feature guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) - Complete guide to automatic desktop backup using watch folders
 
-Paired with the option to run Ente automatically when your computer starts, this
-allows you to automate backups to ente's cloud.
+## Related topics
+- [Watch folders FAQ](/photos/faq/backup-and-sync#watch-folders) - Common questions
+- [Watch folders not syncing](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#watch-folders-not-syncing) - Troubleshooting
 
-### Steps
-
-1. Press the **Watch folders** button in the sidebar. This will open up a dialog
-   where you can add and remove watched folders.
-
-2. To start watching a folder, press the **Add folder** button and select the
-   folder on your system that you want to watch for any changes. You can also
-   drag and drop the folder here.
-
-3. If the folder has nesting, you will see two options - **A single album** and
-   **Separate albums**. This work similarly to the
-   [options you see when you drag and drop a folder with nested folders](/photos/features/albums#preserving-folder-structure).
-
-4. After choosing any of the above options, the folder will be initially synced
-   to Ente's cloud and monitored for any changes. You can now close the dialog
-   and the sync will continue in background.
-
-5. When the app is syncing in the background it'll show a small progress status
-   in the bottom right. You can expand it to see more details if needed.
-
-6. You can stop watching any folder by clicking on the three dots next to the
-   watch folder entry, and then selecting **Stop watching**.
-
-> Note: In case you start a new upload while an existing sync is in progress,
-> the sync will be paused then and resumed when your upload is done.
-
-Some more details about the feature are in our
-[blog post](http://ente.io/blog/watch-folders) announcing it.
-
-## 2-way sync
+---
 
-Note that a two way sync is not currently supported. Attempting to export data
-to the same folder that is also being watched by the Ente app will result in
-undefined behaviour (e.g. duplicate files, export stalling etc).

+title: Set up for daily use
+description: Guide to configuring Ente Photos for automatic daily backup
+---
+
+# Set up for daily use
+
+Now that your account is created and you've logged in to your devices, let's set up Ente Photos to automatically back up your new photos. This is a one-time setup - once configured, Ente will work seamlessly in the background.
+
+## Select albums/folders to back up
+
+The first time you open Ente Photos on a mobile device, you'll be prompted to select which albums you want to back up.
+
+**On mobile (iOS/Android):**
+1. When you first open the app, a list of albums from your device's photo library appears
+2. Select the albums to automatically back up (most people choose "Camera Roll" or "All Photos")
+3. Tap to confirm your selection
+4. Your selected albums will now back up automatically
+
+You can change backed up albums later in **Settings > Backup > Backed up folders**.
+
+**On desktop:**
+Desktop works differently - instead of albums, you set up [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) that automatically sync whenever files are added or changed.
+
+## Understanding automatic backup
+
+Once you've selected your albums, Ente will:
+* Automatically back up new photos and videos you take
+* Work in the background without you needing to open the app
+* Upload photos over WiFi by default to save your mobile data
+* Preserve original quality with no compression
+
+**Backup settings you can configure:**
+
+**On mobile:**
+* **WiFi vs mobile data**: Open `Settings > Backup` and toggle "Backup over mobile data" if you want to back up without WiFi
+* **Background backup**: On iOS, videos won't backup in background - keep the app open for large video uploads
+* **Battery optimization**: On Android, disable battery optimization for Ente to ensure reliable background backup
+
+The initial backup of your existing photos may take some time depending on how many photos you have. Subsequent backups of new photos happen quickly in the background.
+
+## Enable machine learning
+
+Machine learning powers search in Ente Photos, allowing you to search for photos by faces and natural language descriptions like "beach sunset" or "birthday cake".
+
+**Why enable it:**
+- **Face recognition**: Find all photos of specific people
+- **Magic search**: Search using natural language descriptions for objects, scenes, colors, and activities
+- **Completely private**: All processing happens on your device - your photos never leave your device for ML analysis
+
+**How to enable:**
+
+**On mobile:**
+Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning` and enable "Machine learning" and/or "Local indexing".
+
+**On desktop:**
+Open `Settings > Preferences > Machine learning` and enable "Machine learning" and/or "Local indexing".
+
+> **Note**: Machine learning is not available on the web app. You must use mobile or desktop apps.
+
+**What happens next:**
+
+After enabling, the app will download and process your photos locally on your device to build search indexes. This can take some time for large libraries:
+- WiFi is recommended for faster downloads
+- Desktop computers process faster than mobile devices
+- Indexes are encrypted and synced to your other devices
+
+> **Tip**: If you have a large library, enable machine learning on desktop first for faster indexing. Once complete, the indexes sync to your mobile devices.
+
+Learn more in the [Machine learning guide](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning).
+
+## Next steps
+
+You're all set! Ente is now backing up your photos automatically. Here are some features you might want to explore:

+title: Migrate from other services
+description: Guide to importing your existing photos into Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Migrate from other services
+
+If you have photos stored in other services or on your devices, Ente makes it easy to import them.
+
+> **Note**: This step is **optional**. If you're starting fresh with Ente and don't have existing photos to import, you can skip this step and proceed directly to [set up for daily use](/photos/getting-started/daily-use).
+
+This guide will help you choose the right migration method for your situation.
+
+## Which method should I use?
+
+### Migrating from cloud services
+
+If your photos are currently stored in another cloud service, we have detailed guides for the most popular platforms:
+
+* **[From Google Photos](/photos/migration/from-google-photos/)** - Import your Google Photos library using Google Takeout
+* **[From Apple Photos](/photos/migration/from-apple-photos/)** - Import from iCloud Photos or your Mac's Photos app
+* **[From Amazon Photos](/photos/migration/from-amazon-photos)** - Import your Amazon Photos library
+
+### Migrating from local storage
+
+If your photos are stored on your computer or external hard drive:
+
+* **[From local hard disk](/photos/migration/from-local-hard-disk)** - Import photos from folders on your computer or external drives
+
+## How migration works
+
+All migration methods work by importing your photos into Ente while preserving:
+* Original photo quality (no compression)
+* Creation dates and timestamps
+* Folder/album organization (when possible)
+* Photo metadata
+
+The migration process is safe - your original photos remain untouched in their current location until you decide to delete them.
+
+**What to expect:**
+* **Time**: Large photo libraries can take several hours to days to fully import, depending on your library size and internet speed
+* **Storage**: Ensure you have enough storage space in your Ente plan before starting
+* **Duplicates**: Ente automatically detects and handles duplicate photos during import
+
+## Tips for a smooth migration
+
+1. **Start with a small batch** - Try importing a small folder first to familiarize yourself with the process
+2. **Check your storage** - Make sure you have enough storage space in your Ente plan for all your photos
+3. **Use desktop for large libraries** - The desktop app is faster for importing large photo collections
+4. **Keep originals until verified** - Don't delete your original photos until you've confirmed everything imported correctly
+
+## Next steps
+
+Once your photos are imported into Ente:
+* [Set up automatic backup for daily use](/photos/getting-started/daily-use) to configure ongoing backup of new photos

+title: Creating an account
+description: Guide to signing up and creating a new account for Ente Photos
+---
+
+# Create your account and log in
+
+When you open the installed Ente Photos app on any of your devices, the first screen will ask you to choose between "New to Ente" or "Existing user".
+
+## Creating a new account
+
+If you're creating a new account, select "New to Ente".
+
+> **Note**: If you already have an Ente Auth account and plan to use 2FA for Ente Photos (stored in Ente Auth), we recommend keeping separate accounts for Auth and Photos for security. Otherwise, you can use the same account for both.
+
+Creating a new account on Ente takes a few steps:
+1. [Enter and verify an email address](#verify-email)
+2. [Set up a password](#setup-password)
+3. [Save the recovery key](#save-recovery-key)
+4. [Choose between free and paid plans](#choose-plan)
+
+### Enter and verify an email address {#verify-email}
+
+You can choose any email address, including aliases, to create an account with Ente Photos. The only requirement is that you have access to the email inbox for verification. However, keep these points in mind:
+
+* **Long-term access**: Ente Photos is designed for use over multiple years and decades. Use an email address you expect to have access to long-term.
+* **Social features**: Your email address is the primary way for friends and family to discover and share photos with you through shared albums and other social features. If you plan to use these features, consider using an email address your contacts recognize.
+* **Student accounts**: You can use your personal email address to create an account. When applying for a student discount, reach out with your student email address and mention the personal email associated with your account.
+
+In any case, you can always change the email address your account is associated with at a later time as well.
+
+Once you submit your email address, you will be asked to verify it with a 6-digit code sent to your email. You should receive the verification code within a couple of minutes. If you don't receive it, check your spam folder. If that doesn't work, reach out to support@ente.io
+
+### Set up a password {#setup-password}
+
+Once your email is verified, you'll be prompted to create a password for your account. Your password is the foundation of Ente's end-to-end encryption - it's used to encrypt all your photos before they're uploaded to our servers.
+
+Choose a strong, unique password that you haven't used elsewhere. Ente will indicate the strength of your password as you type it.
+
+Once you've set your password, you're ready to proceed to the next step.
+
+### Save the recovery key {#save-recovery-key}
+
+After setting your password, Ente will generate and display your **recovery key**. This is a critical piece of information that you must save securely.
+
+Your recovery key is the only way to recover your account if you forget your password and are logged out of all your devices. Since Ente uses end-to-end encryption, we cannot reset your password for you without this key.
+
+**How to save it:**
+* Write it down on paper and store it in a safe place
+* Save it in a password manager
+* Store it in any secure location you trust
+
+Do not skip this step! Without your recovery key, losing your password means permanently losing access to your photos.
+
+### Choose between free and paid plans {#choose-plan}
+
+The final step of account creation is choosing your plan. Ente offers a generous free plan with **10 GB of storage**, which is perfect for getting started.
+
+You can start with the free plan and upgrade anytime as your storage needs grow. Paid plans offer more storage and additional features like the ability to share albums with others and create family plans.
+
+Once you've made your choice, your account setup is complete and you're ready to start backing up your photos!
+
+## Logging in on other devices
+
+After creating your account on one device, you can easily log in to Ente Photos on all your other devices. Your photos will automatically sync across all devices where you're logged in.
+
+### Logging in process
+
+On any device where you want to use Ente Photos:
+
+1. [Install Ente Photos](/photos/getting-started/installation) if you haven't already
+2. Open the app and select **Existing user** (instead of "New to Ente")
+3. Enter your email address and password
+4. Verify your email with a 6-digit code if prompted
+5. Once logged in, your existing photos from other devices will appear on this device
+
+**Next:** You'll need to [set up automatic backup](/photos/getting-started/daily-use) on this device to back up new photos from it. Each device needs its own backup configuration (which albums to back up on mobile, which folders to watch on desktop).
+
+## Next steps
+
+Now that you're set up on all your devices:
+* [Migrate photos from other services](/photos/getting-started/migration) if you have existing photos elsewhere
+* [Set up automatic backup for daily use](/photos/getting-started/daily-use) to configure your backup preferences

 # Import from Amazon Photos
 
-Amazon Photos does not provide a way to export all of your photos and videos, or
-even albums with a single click.
+Migrating from Amazon Photos to Ente requires downloading your photos from Amazon first, then uploading them to Ente. While Amazon doesn't provide a bulk export tool, this guide will help you through the process.
+
+## Understanding Amazon's limitations
 
-According to their
+Amazon Photos does not provide a way to export all of your photos and videos, or

 [help desk article](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVCELKY5JW77VE7W),
-you have to select and download photos individually.
+you have to select and download photos individually or in batches.
+
+## Migration Process
+
+### Step 1: Download from Amazon Photos
+
+1. Log in to [Amazon Photos](https://www.amazon.com/photos) on your computer
+2. Select photos/videos you want to download (you can select multiple at once)
+3. Click the download option
+4. Choose a download location on your computer
+5. Wait for the download to complete
+
+**Tips for downloading:**
+- Download in batches by album or year to keep things organized
+- Create separate folders for different collections on your computer
+- Keep track of what you've downloaded to avoid missing photos
+
+### Step 2: Organize your downloads (Optional)
+
+Before uploading to Ente, you might want to:
+- Organize photos into folders by date, event, or album
+- Remove duplicates if any were created during download
+- Delete unwanted screenshots or photos you no longer need
+
+This organization will be reflected in Ente if you choose the "Separate albums" option during upload.
+
+### Step 3: Upload to Ente
+
+1. Download and install the [Ente desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop)
+2. Sign in to your Ente account
+3. Drag and drop the downloaded folder(s) into the Ente app
+4. Choose how to organize: single album or separate albums per folder
+5. Let the upload complete
+
+**Upload features:**
+- **Resumable**: If uploads get interrupted, drag and drop the same folder again - Ente will skip already uploaded files
+- **Original quality**: Your photos are uploaded in their original quality with no compression
+- **Metadata preserved**: Photo dates and locations are maintained
+
+## Timeline Expectations
+
+- **Small library (< 10 GB)**: A few hours
+- **Medium library (10-100 GB)**: Several hours to a day
+- **Large library (> 100 GB)**: May take several days depending on your internet speed
+
+You can use your computer while uploads run in the background.
+
+## What about albums?
+
+Amazon Photos albums won't be automatically preserved. However, if you download each album into a separate folder on your computer, you can use Ente's "Separate albums" option during upload to recreate your album structure.
+
+## After Migration
 
-Once you've done that, simply drag and drop this folder into
-[our desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop), and Ente will take care of
-the rest.
+Once your photos are in Ente:
+- [Set up automatic backup](/photos/getting-started/daily-use) for new photos on your mobile devices
+- Consider [enabling machine learning](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning) for face recognition and smart search
+- Explore [sharing features](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/share) to share albums with family and friends
 
-> Note: In case your uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the folder into
-> the same album again, and we will ignore already backed up files and upload

 # Import photos from your local hard disk
 
-Simply drag and drop the folders you want to preserve into
-[our desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop) and grab a cup of coffee (or
-a good night's sleep depending on the size of your library), while we will take
-care of the rest.
+Uploading photos from your computer or external drives to Ente is straightforward using the desktop app. This guide covers everything you need to know for a smooth import.
 
-> Note: in case your uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the folders
-> into the same albums again, and we will ignore already backed up files and
-> upload just the rest.
+## Quick Start
+
+1. Download and install the [Ente desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop) if you haven't already
+2. Sign in to your account
+3. Drag and drop the folders you want to preserve into the app window
+4. Choose your album organization preference (see below)
+5. Let the upload complete
+
+## Understanding folder structure options
+
+When you upload a folder, Ente will ask how you want to organize your photos:
+
+**Single album**: Creates one Ente album containing all files from all subfolders. Best for a collection where folder structure doesn't matter.
+
+**Separate albums**: Creates a separate Ente album for each subfolder. Best for preserving your existing organization (e.g., "2023/Summer", "2023/Winter" become separate albums).
+
+Learn more about [folder structure handling](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/albums#preserving-folder-structure).
+
+## Tips for large libraries
+
+- **Start small**: Try uploading a small folder first to familiarize yourself with the process
+- **Check your storage**: Ensure you have enough space in your Ente plan before starting large uploads
+- **Stable connection**: Use a reliable internet connection, preferably wired Ethernet for very large libraries
+- **Keep app open**: While the initial upload of multi-TB libraries may take hours or even days, the app will resume if interrupted
+- **Resumable uploads**: If uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the same folders again - Ente will skip already uploaded files and continue with the rest
+
+## Alternative: Watch Folders
+
+Instead of a one-time upload, you can use [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) to automatically sync folders on an ongoing basis. This is perfect for:
+- Photo libraries you actively update
+- Automated backup workflows
+- Keeping Ente in sync with your local photo organization
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+**Upload is slow**: Try disabling "Faster uploads" in `Settings > Preferences > Advanced` if you're having issues
+
+**Large videos causing problems**: See the [large uploads troubleshooting guide](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#large-uploads)
+
+**Files being skipped**: Check [files not uploading](/photos/faq/troubleshooting) for common solutions
 
 If you run into any issues during uploads, please reach out to
 [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) and we will be happy to help you!

-If the app stops with an "A JavaScript error occurred in the main process - The
-specified module could not be found" error on your Windows machine when you
-start it, then you might need to install the VC++ runtime from Microsoft.
-
-This is what the error looks like:
-
-<div style="border: 1px solid black">
-
-![Error when VC++ runtime is not installed](windows-vc.png){width=500px}
-
-</div>
-
-You can install the Microsoft VC++ redistributable runtime from here:<br/>
-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version
-
-## Linux
-
-### AppImage desktop integration
-
-AppImages are not fully standalone, and they require additional steps to enable
-full "desktop integration":
-
-- Showing the app icon,
-- Surfacing the app in the list of installed apps,
-- Handling redirection after passkey verification.
-
-All the ways of enabling AppImage desktop integration are mentioned in
-[AppImage documentation](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#integrating-appimages-into-the-desktop).
-
-For example, you can download the
-[appimaged](https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage/releases) AppImage, run it,
-and then download the Ente Photos AppImage into your `~/Downloads` folder.
-_appimaged_ will then pick it up automatically.
-
-### AppImages on ARM64
-
-If you're on an ARM64 machine running Linux, and the AppImages doesn't do
-anything when you run it, you will need to run the following command on your
-machine:
-
-```sh
-sudo ln -s /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libz.so{.1,}
-```
-
-It is possible that the exact path might be different on your machine. Briefly,
-what we need to do is create `libz.so` as an alias for `libz.so.1`. For more
-details, see the following upstream issues:
-
-- libz.so cannot open shared object file on ARM64 -
-  [AppImage/AppImageKit/issues/1092](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/issues/1092)
-
-- libz.so: cannot open shared object file with Ubuntu arm64 -
-  [electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/7835](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/7835)
-
-### AppImage says it requires FUSE
-
-See
-[docs.appimage.org](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting/fuse.html#the-appimage-tells-me-it-needs-fuse-to-run).
-
-tl;dr; for example, on Ubuntu,
-
-```sh
-sudo apt install libfuse2
-```
-
-### Linux SUID error
-
-On some Linux distributions, if you run the AppImage from the CLI, it might fail
-with the following error:
-
-> The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.
-
-This happens when you try to run the AppImage from the command line. If you
-instead double click on the AppImage in your Files browser, then it should start
-properly.
-
-If you do want to run it from the command line, you can do so by passing the
-`--no-sandbox` flag when executing the AppImage. e.g.
-
-```sh
-./ente.AppImage --no-sandbox
-```
-
-For more details, see this upstream issue on
-[electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972).
-
-### Application reporting offline despite Internet connectivity
-
-Due to unreliability of usage of `navigator.onLine` in Linux, the app may report that you are offline, even though the internet connection is functional.
-
-You can resolve the issue by adding a dummy network interface using the following command:
-
-```shell
-ip link add dummy0 type dummy
-ip addr add 10.10.10.1/24 dev dummy0
-ip link set dummy0 up
-```
+---
 
-Once the interface is up, Ente correctly detects that the system is online.

-
-Another alternative is to drag and drop the folder you are trying to upload into
-the app instead of adding a folder watch or uploading a zip. This works better
-because during a drag and drop, the app has direct access to the files via
-browser APIs instead of going via the file system.
-
-Note that the app will detect and skip over already uploaded items into an

-# Network drives
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-The Ente Photos desktop app currently does not support NAS (network drives).
+The content from **Network Drives (NAS)** has been reorganized. You can find it in the following locations:
 
-The app will actually work, and in some cases it will work fine too, but in
-practice we have found that network storage products sometimes have flaky file
-system emulation that causes bad performance during uploads, or when trying to
-directly stream chunks of Google Takeout zips that are stored on network drives.
+## Network Drive Issues
+- [Can I upload from a network drive (NAS)?](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#nas) - Why NAS is not recommended, workarounds, and export considerations for UNC paths
 
-In particular, the folder watch functionality suffers a lot since the app needs
-access to file system events to detect changes to the users files so that they
-can be uploaded whenever there are changes. Network drives are less reliable in
-providing these file change events correctly.
+## Related Topics
+- [Watch folders not syncing](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#watch-folders-not-syncing) - Troubleshooting watch folder issues
+- [Desktop app upload issues](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#large-uploads) - General desktop upload troubleshooting
 
-Since are high chances of the user having a subpar experience, we request
-customers to avoid using the desktop app directly with network attached storage
-and instead temporarily copy the files to their local storage for uploads, and
-avoid watching folders that live on a network drive.
-
-## Exporting to UNC paths
-
-Generally, exports are likely to work better than imports, since the interaction
-with the file system is relatively simpler (Note that the app still needs to
-scan the folder to find existing files, esp. if the continuous export option is
-enabled).
+---
 
-A special case is when exporting to a UNC path. In this case, the file
-separators will not work as expected and the export will not start. As a
-workaround, you can map your UNC path to a network drive and use that instead.

+title: This Page Has Moved
+description: This content has been reorganized

-# Missing or improper thumbnails
+# This Page Has Moved
 
-Firefox (including its other forks like Librewolf) prevents the app from
-generating thumbnails if the "block canvas fingerprinting" setting in Firefox is
-enabled (i.e. **`privacy.resistFingerprinting`** is set to true in
-`about:config`). The app needs the canvas to generate thumbnails, and that
-Firefox feature blocks access to the canvas. Ideally, Firefox should be
-prompting for a permission, but some users have reported that sometime it
-silently blocks access, and turning off that setting works.
+The content from **Missing Thumbnails** has been reorganized. You can find it in the following locations:
 
-Similar issues may arise if you are using an **extension** that blocks access to
-the canvas, or some other browser that has similar restrictions.
+## Thumbnail Issues
+- [Why are my photo thumbnails missing or incorrect?](/photos/faq/troubleshooting#thumbnails) - Solutions for Firefox canvas fingerprinting issues and browser extension conflicts
 
-In all these cases, you need to allow Ente access to the canvas for the
-thumbnail to be generated properly.
-
-Note that once the thumbnails are missing or have been incorrectly generated,
-they cannot be viewed on any of the other clients (the thumbnails are only
-generated once, during upload, so viewing it in a different place does not
-change the already generated thumbnail).
-
-There is currently no functionality to regenerate thumbnails in the above cases.
-You will need to upload the affected files again.
+---
 
-Ente skips over files that have already been uploaded, so you can drag and drop
-the original folder or zip again after removing the files without thumbnails,
-and it'll only upload the files that are necessary.
