+## Meta Frameworks
+
+### Next.js
+
+[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) ("next") provides the meta framework for both the
+Photos and the Auth app, and also for some of the sidecar apps like accounts and
+cast.
+
+We use a limited subset of Next. The main thing we get out of it is a reasonable
+set of defaults for bundling our app into a static export which we can then
+deploy to our webserver. In addition, the Next.js page router is convenient.
+Apart from this, while we use a few tidbits from Next.js here and there, overall
+our apps are regular React SPAs, and are not particularly tied to Next.
