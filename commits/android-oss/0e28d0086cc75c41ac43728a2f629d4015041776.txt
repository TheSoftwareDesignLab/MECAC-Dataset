Prefer using ViewGroup to explicit layout type

LinearLayout etc. inherit from ViewGroup. What we're interested in here is
that there is some containing object, but we don't really care if it's a
LinearLayout, a RelativeLayout, etc. Referring to a ViewGroup will make
it easier to change the layout in XML without having to alter Java code
