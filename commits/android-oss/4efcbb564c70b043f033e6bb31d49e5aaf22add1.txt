[🔴] NT-1197 Red drawer activity count text color when there are errored backings (#859)

## `LoggedInViewHolderViewModel` 
- Added output `activityCountTextColor` that emits the text color of the activity count. It's `ksr_red_400` when a user has errored backings and `text_primary` when they don't
- Added a test for both cases
