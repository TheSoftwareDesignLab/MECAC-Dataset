[💳] One time card pledge (#578)

Updated schema.
NewCardActivity now opens with the keyboard up.
No longer checking for errorMessage and isSuccessful in SavePaymentMethod mutation since the server now properly handles errors.
ApolloClientType.savePaymentMethod now returns a StoredCard.
StoredCard.id is now required so we don't need to do weird stuff when handling server responses.
NewCardFragment can now be presented modally by passing in ArgumentsKey. NEW_CARD_MODAL. When it's modal, it: uses the modal_fragment_new_card.xml layout, errors are piped to modalError instead of error, the AppBarLayout does not have elevation, there is no divider in the form, the reusable switch container is visible.
NewCardFragment.OnCardSavedListener now returns the successfully saved card.
ProjectActivity now implements NewCardFragment.OnCardSavedListener and passes the result to the PledgeFragment.
When the Add new card button is clicked in the PledgeFragment, NewCardFragment is presented modally.
Created a style for modally presented fragments, CardViewFragment.
Updated strings.
Tests.
