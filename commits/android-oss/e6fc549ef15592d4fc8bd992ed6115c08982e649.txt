[💳] NT-416 Improved a11y in Pledge screen (#636)

Pledge screen is now fully traversable.
The screen starts with the mini reward focused so users can jump back to rewards list.
Currency that can't be edited (shipping, total, pledge summary, shipping summary) now read as one element.
pledgeSummaryAmount, shippingAmount, shippingSummaryAmount, and totalAmount outputs in the PledgeFragmentViewModel are now CharSequences instead of Strings.
Removed currency symbol TextViews in shipping section fragment_pledge_section_shipping.xml, pledge summary section fragment_pledge_section_summary_pledge.xml, shipping summary section fragment_pledge_section_summary_shipping.xml, and total section fragment_pledge_section_total.xml
ProjectViewUtils. styleCurrency(amount: Double) (method used to style a currency's precision) is now a private helper method used by ProjectViewUtils.styleCurrency(value: Double, project: Project, ksCurrency: KSCurrency).
ProjectViewUtils.styleCurrency(value: Double, project: Project, ksCurrency: KSCurrency) no longer returns currency with trailing or leading white space.
Added a helper method PledgeFragment.setPlusTextView so currency with a + image reads as "plus {currency_amount}"
Hiding Other payment methods label while Google Pay is not supported.
Reward Select button's content description is now Select this reward.
Updated strings.
