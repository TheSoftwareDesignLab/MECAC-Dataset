🔙] NT-479 Pledge toolbar navigation (#661)

- Added ic_arrow_back.xml. We now use this rounded style everywhere. Deleted ic_action_icon__arrow_left.xml.
- Updated ic_arrow_down.xml color to ksr_soft_black.
- Renamed ProjectViewModel input collapsePledgeSheet to pledgeToolbarNavigationClicked.
- Added pledgeToolbarNavigationIcon output to ProjectViewModel. It emits the down icon drawable when the back stack is empty and the back icon when it's not.
- Added goBack output to ProjectViewModel. It emits when the pledge toolbar navigation icon is clicked and there are fragments on the back stack.
- expandPledgeSheet now only emits when the back stack is empty and we need to collapse the sheet.
- Renamed rewardsToolbarTitle to pledgeToolbarTitle.
