[🐛] NT-467 Fixes bug with pledge text color and max warning (#658)

- The pledgeTextColor output now depends on the rewardMinimum and the pledge maximum (country max - shipping). It's green when it's valid and red when it's invalid.
- The pledgeMaximumIsGone output now only emits true when the maximum pledge is greater than OR equal to the pledge input.
- PR feedback from Isabel: Added additional test for when the pledge input is equal to the maximum pledge.
