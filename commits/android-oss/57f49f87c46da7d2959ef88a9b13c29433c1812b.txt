[👷🏾‍♀️] NT-588 Setting up regression variant (#678)

- Deleted broken existing UI tests.
- Moved the rest of the UI tests into suites organized by test category.
- Added androidx.test.espresso:espresso-contrib lib.
- Created a new variant of the app regression since we don't want to ever run these tests on production or a real web API. It has an app icon with a cobalt background and is populated with mock data from our Factory classes.
- Moved provideApolloClientType and provideApiClientType out of the main ApplicationModule and into the variant specific ApplicationModule`s because regression only ever hits the mock clients.
- Added fake google-service.json files to the config so anyone can build regression after running make bootstrap.
