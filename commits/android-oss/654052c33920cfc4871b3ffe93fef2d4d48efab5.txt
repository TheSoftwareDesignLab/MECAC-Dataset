Move views, adapters, activities into ui package

Experimenting with MVP. Android already has its own idea of 'MVP' -
the model layer is made up of POJOs, the view layer is the XML under `res`,
and the presenter is the activity. The problem is that the activity ends
up taking on many view layer responsibilities, since XML alone is
not enough. Activities are tightly bound to layouts, so they end up being
interspersed with interaction and display logic.

Also - aside from the view layer in XML, Android also has `View` classes (e.g.
`TextView`, `CardView`). These View classes alone aren't enough to make up
for an entire view layer though, since Adapters, Activities, Fragments and
Views all have view-like responsibilities.

So for now I'm bucketing the view layer under a `ui` package. Anything in here
should be about rendering content and receiving events.
