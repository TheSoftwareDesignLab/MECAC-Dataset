[🏳] NT-344 Using native checkout feature flag in external builds (#656)

- Added FeatureKey.ANDROID_NATIVE_CHECKOUT with the value android_native_checkout from kickstarter/kickstarter#14803 SINCE it's finally at MVP
- Clicking the ✖️ icon in the Thanks toolbar will take users to Discovery if they went through webview checkout and back to the refreshed project if they went through native checkout.
  - Added closeButtonClicked input to ThanksViewModel.
  - Added finish output to ThanksViewModel that emits when we should finish the ThanksActivity.
  - Added resumeDiscoveryActivity output to ThanksViewModel that emits when we should go back to the DiscoveryActivity.
- The ProjectActivity now updates its UI when the Config changes.
  - Instead of having 2 layouts for the ProjectActivity, it just has one: activity_project.xml. project_layout.xml was deleted and new outputs were added to handle the UI from the VM.
  - Added horizontalProgressBarIsGone output to ProjectViewModel that emits a boolean determining if the horizontal progress bar should be visible.
  - Added pledgeActionButtonContainerIsGone output to ProjectViewModel that emits a boolean determining if the pledge action buttons container should be visible.
  - Added pledgeContainerIsGone output to ProjectViewModel that emits a boolean determining if the pledge container should be visible.
Updated projectAndUserCountry to projectAndNativeCheckoutEnabled. We were not using the country.
  - Added reloadProgressBarIsGone output to ProjectViewModel that emits a boolean determining if the progress bar in the reaload container should be visible.
 - Removed showBackingFragment and showRewardsFragment because they conflicted.
 - Added updateFragments that emits when we should update the BackingFragment and the RewardsFragment. We now subscribe in onResume so we don't throw an IllegalStateException.
- The ProjectViewHolder is now configured with just a Project.
  - Added projectActionButtonContainerIsGone output to ProjectHolderViewModel that emits a boolean determining if the inline project action buttons should be visible.
- Tests
