[🔢] Pledge input (#570)

* - Updated strings
- Updated `ActivityExt.hideKeyboard` to set proper flag and clear focus after hiding keyboard.
- Added `NumberUtils.parse`.
- Moved `KSCurrency.getPrecision` and `KSCurrency.isWholeNumber` to `NumberUtils`.
- `StringUtils.trim` also trims extra whitespace
- `ViewUtils.styleCurrency` was split into three methods because the reward screen has a different style from the pledge screen: `RewardViewUtils.styleCurrency`, `ProjectViewUtils.currencySymbolAndPosition`, `ProjectViewUtils.styleCurrency`.
- `ProjectActivity` hides the keyboard when clicking outside an `EditText`
- `PledgeFragment` now accepts pledge amounts via the numerical keyboard. A warning is displayed when a pledge is attempted with an invalid number.
- Moved reward card animation helper methods to the bottom of `PledgeFragment`
- Updated our `Dialog` background style with `background_dialog.xml`
- Gave `pledge_amounts_loading_states` a fixed height of `grid_2`
- Moved the major sections of `fragment_pledge.xml` to their own layout files (`fragment_pledge_section_delivery.xml`, `fragment_pledge_section_payment.xml`, `fragment_pledge_section_pledge_amount.xml`, `fragment_pledge_section_shipping.xml`, `fragment_pledge_section_.total.xml`) so it's much cleaner.
- TESTS. Nino and I decided to organize the tests with descriptive method names for understandability
