[🆕] NT-399 Adding new Koala properties (#628)

- Added is_vo_on to default event properties. The value is defined as if TalkBack™ is on not Select to Speak™
- Added payment_method to default project properties. The value is defined as values from the CreditCardPaymentType enum (ANDROID_PAY, APPLE_PAY, BANK_ACCOUNT, CREDIT_CARD) which is what's returned in backing.paymentSource.paymentType.
- Added pledge_total to default project properties. The value is backing.amount.
something important to note: In order to accurately track payment_method and pledge_total, we don't track the project page view events until the project is fully loaded.
- Alphabetized properties in assertProjectProperties.
- Updated tests.
