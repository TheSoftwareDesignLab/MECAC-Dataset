No reward ui (#549)

The no reward view did not match the Abstract designs; it should match the other rewards.
- Removed HorizontalNoRewardViewHolder.kt, HorizontalNoRewardViewHolderViewModel.kt, HorizontalNoRewardViewHolderViewModelTest.kt and item_no_reward.xml.
- The title and description outputs are now optional Strings. If they're null and for a physical or digital reward, we hide those views. For no reward, we show the static copy.
- Updated tests to make sure we're properly displaying no reward.
