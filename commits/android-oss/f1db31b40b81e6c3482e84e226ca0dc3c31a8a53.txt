Introducing Apollo into the codebase (#321)

* added apollo to the app with call

* Fixing gradle imports.
Updating query to see if that would help.
Lite refactor.

* Renaming and refactoring GraphQLInterceptor so now it will hopefully work.

* wip creating an interface for Apollo

* trying to figure out how to test singles

* Added example for making Apollo calls and tests. Needs refactor because Singles only emit once

* Switched from Single to Observable to make for easier integration with existing helper transformers.
Added progress bar to show when call is being executed.

* cleanup

* had to move the viewmodel to the main directory so the tests would pass]
