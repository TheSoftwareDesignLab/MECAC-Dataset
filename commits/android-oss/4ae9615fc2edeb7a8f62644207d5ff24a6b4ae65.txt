[🚀] NT-586 Clicking Editorial in disco opens Editorial projects list (#683)

- Updated strings and config.
Passing in an Editorial to the EditorialActivity loads a DiscoveryFragment with the tag_id of the Editorial, sorted by home (magic).
Added tagId to DiscoveryParams.
Deleted go_rewardless_tout since now go_rewardless_header is used in both the tout and the header.
Editorial is now an enum.
Tests

- Synced with Colleen on the spacing of the Activity touts.
Added trust_700. We're slowly transitioning to the KDS palette.

- The entire Editorial card is focusable so both the title and description are read as one item. And since it's clickable, TalkBack™ will say "Double tap to activate".
