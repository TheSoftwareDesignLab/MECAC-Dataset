change email validation (#352)

Switched to horizontal progress bar below toolbar.
No longer crashing when user can't connect to the server.
Added back CustomAdapter for Email because the mutation fails without it. (I wonder if it'll work if we pass in Any)
Added StringUtils. isValidPassword.
Added options menu to ChangeEmailActivity with save button that is enabled/disabled when input is valid or network call is in progress.
Hiding the keyboard when the user clicks save.
Created data class ChangeEmail so the validation is easier to follow in the view model.
Moved the start and end margin to the TextInputLayout instead of the TextInputEditText so the error is left aligned.
Showing error on email input when it loses focus and isn't valid.
Showing error snackbar. (will be restyled in a different PR)
Tests ✨
