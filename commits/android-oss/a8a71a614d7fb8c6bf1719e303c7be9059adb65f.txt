[🗣] NT-252 Improved a11y on project page (#635)

- Project screen is now fully traversable when native checkout is enabled or disabled.
- Manage button's contentDescription is Manage your pledge.
- When the Fragments back stack changes, we set all but the top Fragment's view as accessible.
- When the pledge sheet is collapsed: Project toolbar requests focus. The project details are accessible.
- When the pledge sheet is expanded: Pledge toolbar requests focus. The project details are no longer accessible (because they're obscured).
- Added a 1 second delay to loading the project so the pledge sheet doesn't steal focus when native checkout is enabled.
- Renamed rewards_toolbar to pledge_toolbar for accuracy.
- Added proper collapse icon as ic_arrow_down.xml
- Renamed rewards_container to pledge_container_root for accuracy.
- Removed explicitly setting the project stats contentDescription in the ProjectViewHolder because it's called before the project is fully loaded and incomplete.
- Fixed crash when attempting to update BackingFragment and PledgeFragment when the ProjectActivity is finishing.
