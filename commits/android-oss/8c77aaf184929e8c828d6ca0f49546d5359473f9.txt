[💧] NT-653 Set up additional tracking client to hit the Data Lake™  (#692)

- Abstracted reusable parts KoalaTrackingClient to TrackingClient so now KoalaTrackingClient is an extension of a TrackingClient.
- Added LakeTrackingClient which is an extension of a TrackingClient to the Environment.
- Added LakeBackgroundService to handle background task of sending tracking event requests.
- Added LakeService as API interface. It currently only sends a PUT request to the record endpoint with a "Content-Type: application/json" header.
- Added @LakeEndpoint, @LakeRetrofit, @LakeTracker, and @KoalaTracker qualifiers so our dependency injection can differentiate between clients.
- Added fake values for Secrets.LakeEndpoint.Staging and Secrets.LakeEndpoint.Production. - -- Currently only sending events to staging until the events are fully finalized.
- Currently only tracking App Open, App Close and Discover List View events with the properties time and user_logged_in because those are whitelisted.
