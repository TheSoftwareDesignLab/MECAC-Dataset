[✨] NT-587 Go rewardless carousel treatment (#685)

* Added background output to NativeCheckoutRewardViewHolderViewModel that emits a Int representing the background of the reward contents. 0 is how you clear the background.
Added bg_go_rewardless as the special go rewardless background Drawable.
Added special go rewardless copy when a user is viewing No reward and they haven't backed No reward.
Decreased the size of the gradient behind the Select button for readability.

* PR feedback from Isabel: Adding more tests for outputs when go rewardless is disabled.
Not showing background in view manage pledge screen.
