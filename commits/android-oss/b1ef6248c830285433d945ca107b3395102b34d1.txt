[🚮] MixPanel removal (#398)

* First pass of removing Mixpanel from the codebase:
Removed import and metadata from build.gradle and manifest.
Created a KoalaService retrofit instance to hit our tracking endpoint.
Instead of using MixpanelAPI in KoalaTrackingClient, using KoalaService.
Posting the tracking info as a Base64 encoded string like iOS.
Adding obfuscated tracking properties that were set by Mixpanel

* Created KoalaBackgroundService that uses android JobDispatcher to send tracking events in the background.
Comes with free automatic retries woohoo.
Also, it doesn't run the jobs unless there's a network connection.
Fixed a crash in project cards if the project name is null.
You can now add some bundled data to the JobDispatcher (with a max of 500K)

* moved default properties to TrackingClientType interface

* tests

* Making constant time in MockKoala client and attempting to make tests pass

* switching from a TestSubscriber to a BehaviorSubject so I can get the last value

* Added tests for tracking default properties and project views. Project view tracking is broken because we always null for the user...

* YAY TESTS ARE PASSING.
Fixed bug where we never sent info about logged in user.
Added missing fields to updates tracking.
Removed prefixes from disco tracking.
Alphabetizing.

* Cleanup and logging out properties of successfully tracked event.

* Checkstyle and properly logging properties.

* removing koala endpoint placeholder
* removing koala endpoints from makefile
