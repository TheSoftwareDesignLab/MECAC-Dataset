apply eslint-disable max-len around block comments that need to have a long line

The `@api ` lines can't have a line break in them because it would
cause the first part of the text to not be displayed on the apidocs
website.

Using `// eslint-disable-line max-len` at the end of an `@api `
line doesn't work, possibly because it's nesting a comment inside
a multi-line comment.

The only way I've found to ignore the `max-len` rule is to put
disable and enable comments around the whole comment block.
