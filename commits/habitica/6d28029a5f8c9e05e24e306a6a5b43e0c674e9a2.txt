Clientside: Block low lvl for high lvl spells - Fixes #12904 (#13135)

* Add lvl block on high lvl spell, add i18n for not enough gold/lvl for spell.
Add space for invalidClass because of simple lint

* Wrap i18n in the msgbox funcion

* Remove trailing whitespace (as seen in a comment weblate)

* Block level first

Change blocking order so that the spell is prevented based on lvl, then mana, then gold

* Strip notEnoughLvl pop-up error (and i18n):
Button is already visually distinguishable

* fix lint (mv comment, return null)
