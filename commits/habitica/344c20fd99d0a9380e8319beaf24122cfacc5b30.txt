improve error notification shown when a player is blocked

This improves the wording in the error notification that a player
sees when they've been blocked.

It also also changes markdown links to plain text because raw
markdown was being shown in some locations (for example when you saw
the error messages on the command line while using an API command).

These changes have been discussed with and approved by beffymaroo
and the other mods.
