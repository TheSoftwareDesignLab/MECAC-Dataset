Fix drawer text overlapping at smaller screen resolutions (#10360)

* Replace divs with semantic markup

Replace `<div>` tags with `<nav>`, `<aside>`, and a list for the nav items.

* Use grid layout

Replace flexbox with CSS grid layout. The right-hand side item is now in its own
grid cell, so the text wraps inside its cell at smaller screen widths.

Undo `<nav>` tag.

* Sort CSS

Sort the remaining CSS property declarations.

* Fix right alignment issue in Safari

Remove `justify-self: end` to fix the right alignment issue in Safari.

* Fix vertical alignment in Edge

Add `align-self: center` but only for MS Edge.

Also removed `position: relative` on the wrapper element for the tabs.
As the help item isn't using absolute positioning anymore we don't need
to set relative positioning on the parent element.
