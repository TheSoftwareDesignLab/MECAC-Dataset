Adding support for loading more members for Groups (#9740)

* Adding support for loading more members for Groups

Addresses issue #9720

Member modal component was only loading the maximum limit for queries
made to _getMembersForItem in /members, except with Challenges, which
was able to display a "Load More" button to retrieve another set of
users from the Challenge.

Made a few changes to how the GET request was being made when querying
for more members, added an easier way to know whether or not to display
the Load More button, and extracted some of the actions that were
too tightly coupled with the membersModal.vue.

* Fixes for failing lint tests

* Removing unnecessary async/await usage

* Fixing party view in header section

* Resolving missed conflict

* Adding necessary data for View Party in index header for web client to load party members
