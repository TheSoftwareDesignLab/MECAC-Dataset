new client various fixes: Hall of Heroes is visible, Sort gear by Perception, etc (#9070)

* adjust wording and time format for Custom Day Start time confirmation

- explains that this is the EARLIEST possible time for cron
- allows user to see the exact earliest time

* remove unnecessary hyphen from login date in Profile; added whitespace after colons

* allow Hall of Heroes to be seen by non-admin users (except for admin interface)

Also removes a level of code indentation that seemed to be incorrect.

* clarify that Orb of Rebirth costs 0 gems after level 100

Previously, the modal showed just a gem icon with no number, which was misleading.
Now it shows explicitly 0 gems.

* fix spelling mistake (Challeges > Challenges)

* allow equipment to be sorted by Perception

Also change Con > CON, Per > PER, etc for consistency with abbreviations used in other locations.
