* added responsive scss to allow modals to respond to changing window size

* Remove unecessary space

* moved scss around

* remove unnecessary space

* Adjust left and right panels to be more responsive + moved css for buyQuestModal into its respective vue file (startQuestModal css wasn't working in its vue file... I can't figure out why)
