Improve a11y for the sync links

Add `role="link"` so it shows up as a link in VoiceOver.

Add `tabindex="0" so it can receive keyboard focus, and a keyup handler
for the enter key so it will respond to `<Enter>` keypresses.

Add `aria-label="$t('sync')"` to add text for non-visual users.

Add aria-label to mobile sync icon link.
