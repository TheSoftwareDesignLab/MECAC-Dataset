 - Removed remaining 'foundKey' logic
 - Adjusted test logic to reflect feature change

* Reverting userCtrl.js to development version
 - Reintroduces "classes" Guide tour

* New version of Fixes #7958
 - Changed logic to only notify user the first time they choose a class
 - Changed message to represent this change in logic
 - #LINT: Cleaned interface for changing class
    - New method: enableClasses() -- because, really, should we be calling User.changeClass({}) from the UX?

* Remove new User Flag, use flags.tour.classes

* Whoopsie. Fix PR conflict.
