locales/groups: Don't wrap task text in code block (#10349)

So far if a task contained Markdown, a system message like this would
have been posted to the group chat:

foo has claimed "Some [link](http://example.org/)"

Also, if the Markdown contained backticked code fragments, the whole
text would be displayed in red except the code part.

The reason for this is because the system message is already in Markdown
and a backticked task text would result in the following Markdown:

`foo has claimed "Foo `bar`"`

Here there are two code blocks, one with `foo has claimed "Foo ` and
another which only has `"`.

This is fixed by simply changing the userIsClamingTask translation
string to not wrap the task text inside a code block, as per @Alys
suggestion.
