Bugfix in ko/front.json (#12790)

In weblate we have the allert:
Weblate could not parse the translation files while updating the translations.

The following occurrences were found:
Filename	Error
website/common/locales/ko/front.json	JSONDecodeError('Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 19 column 1 (char 805)',)

I deleted the trailing comma (so that no further entry is expected).
