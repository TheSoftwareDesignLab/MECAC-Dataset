Add translations to Karma specs

* Added a task to Gruntfile to use website/src/i18n.js to generate a small JS file to be loaded in Karma env which sets window.env.translations to the i18n.translations['en'].

* Added new Grunt task to build:dev

* Updated Karma specs to reenable testing where possible, updating comments where not.
