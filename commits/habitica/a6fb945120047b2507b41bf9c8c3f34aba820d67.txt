inventory sorting

Add inventory sorting buttons based on name, attribute, and set (armoire):
-  Each gear[klass] has its own sorting buttons and sorting state including costume classes
-  The attributes sort descending when selected, then by sum of all attributes
-  There is no default sort
-  The armoire also sorts by set which sorts by item[set] descending, it does not sort within a set (ex "1 of 3" vs "2 of 3")
-  Name sorts by .text() ascending
