Fix for issue #3477, 'No "Contact Us" at Bottom of the page. Added the new link and used the existing env.t('contactUs') string so all the translations are correct. Also added the link to layout.jade because that was stubbed out there in comments. Both links go to a new page with other links as described in the issue.
