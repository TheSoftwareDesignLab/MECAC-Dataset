Modal responsive improvements (#14087)

* stack profile actions on smaller screens

* stack avatar and stats for even smaller screens

* remove unnecessary classes to keep profile nav on the same line

* adjust media query width

* refactor stats removing unnecessary classes and simplifying with less elements and relying more on flexbox

* adjust breakpoints for modal vs pofile page

* more margin for avatar

* handle allocation on middle size more gracefully
