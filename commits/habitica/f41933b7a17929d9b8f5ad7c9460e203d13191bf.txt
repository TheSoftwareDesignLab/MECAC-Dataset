Repair Broken Test Suite - Full Passing Tests

* Repair broken e2e test introduced in 8d03cfc (copywriting change was not
  reflected in the spec)

* Updated i18n.coffee code to be more cautious (it expected the 'en' locale
  would always be available, but provides appropriate error handling as-is).

* Extended timeout duration for protractor, as registration was slightly above
  30s.

* Added karma-mocha-reporter as a dev dependency to ensure test visibility.
