A few comments:
Plate, directly translated, is hardly used. I did so anyways, but personally i think "Heavy Armor", "Heavy Helmet" and so on would sound better in portuguese.
The part where the code stated "Panda Egg" had "Wolf Cub" written on it. I translated as "Panda Cub", but if it was intended, i'll correct it.
Town crier was particularly hard to translate. I went with "arauto". If any other translators want to have at it, be my guests.
