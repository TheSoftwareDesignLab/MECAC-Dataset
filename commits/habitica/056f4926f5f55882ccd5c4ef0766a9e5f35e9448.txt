selList overflow (#13179)

* Limit `membersModal` list selector to 12-unit grid (to prevent wrap around on long text for `sortOptions`)
* Add ellipse based overflow for `membersModal` list selector
* Add padding so that the checkmark for `membersModal` list doesn't overlap with text
* Use scss with v-deep properly (also pretty checkmark to "full-width" of checkmark)
