Show error message in empty market inventory drawer (#9041)

* client/tasks/user: (create dropdown) change icon color on menuitem hover

Previously the color was only changing when you hovered over the
text or icon.

This change changes the icon color when you hover anywhere over
the `menuitem`

* client/shops/market: fix search field in market

* Hide drawer sliders if number of items for type is empty
* Move drawer-help-text icon down to line up vertically with text
* Add TODO for error thrown when trying to sell special item types

* client/tasks/taskModal: display all selected tags for task

* i18n/groups: religous to religious

* client/shops/market: Add error message to empty drawer slider

* Create new locale file to hold inventory locales

* client/tasks/user: Revert change to create dropdown

* Revert tag changes

This will be picked up in a separate PR.

* Fix missing space before function paren
