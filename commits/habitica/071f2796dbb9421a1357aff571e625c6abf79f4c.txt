Adjusting challenges view translation

- Make "Back to all challenges" button translatable
- Allow some flexibility for the line "#_of_gems gem_icon Prize" - this
is made following the practices with linkstart/linkend implementation
- prize "string" is left as is because used as a placeholder
- code comment "prize" had to be moved 1 line up - before the p (as no
room for it is left inside the p) which however seems OK to me, because
the comments above and below has been made the same way before
