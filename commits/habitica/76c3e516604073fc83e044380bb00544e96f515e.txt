sep 25 fixes (#9075)

* on class change: remove owned gear from pinned items

* move dragging item-info closer to the cursor (food / hatching potion)

* remove v-once at attributesPopover (if the parent component is recycled the old data stays active)

* prevent popover to show data of an item that was removed - but the popover stays opened
