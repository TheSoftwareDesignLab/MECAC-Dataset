remove links to Moderator Contact Form

This is a temporary measure until we can get the form working again.

This has NOT been approved by any of Habitica's staff.
It's just being proposed for consideration.

The changes are:

- remove link from Help menu
- replace link in Contacts page with mailto admin@habitica.com without changing the visible text of the link
- replace link in Tavern sidebar with mailto admin@habitica.com using the visible text from the Contacts page
