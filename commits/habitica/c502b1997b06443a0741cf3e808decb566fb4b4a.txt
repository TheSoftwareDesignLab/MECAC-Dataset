Updated new-groups / group-plans static page #8674 (#8729)

* dummy

* Renamed internationalized strings to more meaningful names

* moved the new group creation state out to its own URL, so it can also be linked to by the static/plans page

* Added redirect-through-login functionality from the static/plans page new-group button
This includes a static non-modal login page (similar to how other sites have both a login page and login modal)
The login body has been abstracted out from its modal-specific view into mixins to accomplish this
