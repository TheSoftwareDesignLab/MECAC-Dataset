Improve a11y for the dropdown menu

Add role="button" to make the component report itself as a button.

Add tabindex so the menu toggle can receive keyboard focus.

Add keydown handlers for `<Enter>` and `<Space>` so the dropdown menu
toggle responds to keyboard input.

Set the aria-pressed attribute to true if the menu is open, or false if
it is closed.
