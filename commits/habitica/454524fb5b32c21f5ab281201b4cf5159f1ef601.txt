member-details: Only add 1px margin when condensed (#10504)

As reported in #10502, adding a 1 pixel right margin to *all* nodes with
the member-stats class will affect the display when you click on the
avatar as well, which will then break the layout because of that
additional margin.

Instead of adding the margin to .member-stats in general, let's just add
it to the condensed version so that it really just addresses the
flickering on Chrome/Chromium as reported in #10379.

I've tested whether the flickering still happens via a small
xdotool-loop (just to make sure I don't get too shaky with the mouse):

for i in $(seq 500 508); do xdotool mousemove "$i" 250; sleep 5; done

The flickering doesn't happen anymore and the layout in the party
members overview and the stats overview when you click on the avatar is
no longer distorted.
