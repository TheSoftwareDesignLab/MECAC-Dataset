Portuguese Translation Fixes

Checked through lines 1-24:

- Fixed general verb and noun mistakes
- Fixed a few words that were still in English
- Kept role-playing game in English. RPG's should be understood by Portuguese-speakers. 
- Pretty sure como makes more sense than conforme.
- Believe I fixed some improper use of the imperative form. Correct me if I'm wrong.
- Pluralized recompensas
- Changed Bem vindo to boas-vindas. Bem-vindo may be accurate though?
- Other general fixes that escape me.

Plan to do more.
