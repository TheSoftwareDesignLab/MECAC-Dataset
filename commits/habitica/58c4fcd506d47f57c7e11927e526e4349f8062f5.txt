Fix sellModal data caching (#11044)

* Several deps set to "optional" in lock file

This was done automatically when running `npm i` on Windows.

Node v10.15.2
NPM 6.4.1

* Begin working on issue #10687

Key files to look into:
- website/client/components/inventory/item.vue
- website/client/components/shops/market/sellModal.vue

File notes for me:

item.vue: provides wrapper for displaying item data.

sellModel.vue: for displaying items player intends to sell
- lines 10-21: check `item` computed property and load `item` component
- lines 151-153: ask how return line is evaluated to an `item`

The last one could be important to figuring out this caching issue.
Since the property is computed, it's possible that line is evaluating to
a truthy value that Vue is seeing as unchanged, even if the actual
`item` object is different each time.

* Pick up from sellModal.vue:155

This is where the item context seems to be set. The Vue dev tools
indicate that the `<item>` component is updating. It's only the `item`
reference inside of the `<sellModal>` component that isn't updating.

Issue #10687

* Remove (v-once) directive

This was preventing data referenced within nested elements from
updating.

Issue #10687

* Revert package-lock.json to "develop" version

This removes the "optional" settings that were automatically added by NPM to a handful of dependencies while working on PR #11044.

* Attempt to rerun tests

The most recent change shouldn't have caused tests to fail.
