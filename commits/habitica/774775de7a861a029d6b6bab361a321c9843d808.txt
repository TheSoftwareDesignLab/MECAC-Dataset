fixes: appliedTags, add moment to rootScope (repeat i18n issues). Also,
discard the sync-queue if errors were detected. Previously, if an op
triggered server error, the op is still in the queue and will keep
trying. Thus, in-browser user is corrupt - they'll need to logout /
clear localStorage. This *should* fix that, while still allowing the
sync-queue to build up when offline (status appears to == 0 in those
cases). @paglias just FYI - should be good, but wanna loop you in just
in case.
