make Bailey correctly explain about Aquatic Friends achievement badge (#8853)

* make Bailey correctly explain about Aquatic Friends achievement badge

It's this error again: https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/issues/8658

From katzalina in the Report a Bug guild:
"not a priority: Re:Bailey's news 07/05/ it says: both you and you
friend get the aquatic friends badge - I splashed a party member
and did not get the badge (didn't expect to either, until reviewing
the news). Am I experiencing a bug or has there been a systematic
change and the news text doesn't reflect it, yet? Thanks"

* the incorrect message was in an earlier Bailey as well
