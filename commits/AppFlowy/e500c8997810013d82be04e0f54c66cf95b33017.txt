* chore: show ai service error (#5675)

* feat: Implement color picker dialog for user color selection (#5041)

- Added `flex_color_picker` dependency.
- Implemented a new color picker dialog with the following features:
  - Display Material predefined colors.
  - Include primary, accent, and shade colors, as well as a color wheel for selection.
  - Add a graphical opacity selector.
  - Enhanced the previous dialog to include an icon in a text field for opening the palette.
- Added `suffixIcon` parameter to the `_ColorSettingTextField` class, making it reactive to tap gestures.
- Utilized `ColorExtension` on the `Color` class to avoid namespace conflicts when converting colors to hexadecimal strings.
- Added translation strings to english
