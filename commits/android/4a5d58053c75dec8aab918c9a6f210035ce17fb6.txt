Don't load icon dialog resources every time and on main thread (#2450)

- Don't load the icon dialog's icon pack every time the fragment is resumed, it only needs to be loaded once
 - Don't load the icon dialog's icon pack on the main thread, instead load it on the IO thread to prevent blocking the fragment UI thread (as suggested in the loadDrawables function)
 - Clean up @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.N_MR1) annotations
