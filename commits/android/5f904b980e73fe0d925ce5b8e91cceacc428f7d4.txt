Wear os authentication (#1691)

* Initial proof-of-concept: sharing Session over data layer

* Add initial onboarding and login flow

In onboarding, the home assistant urls are received from connected devices. If the user clicks on it, the authentication flow starts.
The user can alter the login details and proceed to login.
The authentication uses the "auth/login_flow" api, instead of the normal authentication api, since there is no support for webview on wear os.
