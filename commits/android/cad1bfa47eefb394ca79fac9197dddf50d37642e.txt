Fix restoring custom fields in service button widget (#3813)

- When reading service data from the database, make sure to also add custom fields.
 - Fix RecyclerView not setting fields to empty when no value is present, potentially showing input from other recycled fields if the field doesn't have any value.
 - Fix adding a new custom field destroying any input currently held in the views by using a specific insertion method instead of all changed, which will reset the values.
