Better state change subscriptions in entity state and media player widgets (#2814)

Implement subscribe_trigger and use it in widgets

 - Implement support for subscribing using subscribe_trigger, currently used to get state changes only for specific entities
 - Change the entity state and media player widgets to use this new subscription instead of subscribing to all state changes, based on the template widget
 - Removed some placeholder code from media player widget
