Fix editing service button widget shows/creates incorrect field values (#2651)

* Fix button widget field data overwrite on text change

 - The text changed listener might be called while the button widget fields were being setup if a value exists. If other fields are bound at the same time this might overwrite their values and cause problems, so make sure to use the adapter position for the viewholder instead.
 - If setting a value fails set the text input to empty instead of showing the previous value

* Fix incorrect input in button widget fields

 - Properly set the hint for the button widget fields to null if no hint is available to prevent an old hint from being visible
 - Properly set the autocomplete functionality to null if no autocomplete functionality is expected to prevent unwanted autocompletion

* Fix services list if service was previously selected

 - Always load the full services list, even if a service was previously selected, and apply a filter on the list after setting it to prevent the dropdown from showing incorrect values
