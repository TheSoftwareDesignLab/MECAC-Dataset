commit 7d6f11af4fc4508a7384cb4662da1719233ba7f8

    Add support for Assist pipeline, update Wear implementation (#3526)

    * Group incoming messages by subscription to prevent out-of-order delivery

     - Messages received on the websocket are processed asynchronously, which is usually fine but can cause issues if messages need to be received in a specific order for a subscription. To fix this, process messages in order for the same subscription.

    * Implement Assist pipeline API

     - Add basic support for the Assist pipeline API
     - Update conversation function to use the Assist pipeline when on the minimum required version
     - Update UI to refer to Assist pipeline requirement

    Fix expanded zone id for high accuracy zone constraint (#3509)

    - When checking if an expanded zone geofence should be created include the server ID in the comparison as that is what is used everywhere else. Otherwise expanded zones are never added, and as a result high accuracy mode won't work as expected.

    Add support for Assist pipeline, update Wear implementation (#3526)

    * Group incoming messages by subscription to prevent out-of-order delivery

     - Messages received on the websocket are processed asynchronously, which is usually fine but can cause issues if messages need to be received in a specific order for a subscription. To fix this, process messages in order for the same subscription.

    * Implement Assist pipeline API

     - Add basic support for the Assist pipeline API
     - Update conversation function to use the Assist pipeline when on the minimum required version
     - Update UI to refer to Assist pipeline requirement

commit 7d6f11af4fc4508a7384cb4662da1719233ba7f8
Author: Joris Pelgröm <jpelgrom@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Sat May 13 04:51:47 2023 +0200

    Add support for Assist pipeline, update Wear implementation (#3526)

    * Group incoming messages by subscription to prevent out-of-order delivery

     - Messages received on the websocket are processed asynchronously, which is usually fine but can cause issues if messages need to be received in a specific order for a subscription. To fix this, process messages in order for the same subscription.

    * Implement Assist pipeline API

     - Add basic support for the Assist pipeline API
     - Update conversation function to use the Assist pipeline when on the minimum required version
     - Update UI to refer to Assist pipeline requirement

    Fix expanded zone id for high accuracy zone constraint (#3509)

    - When checking if an expanded zone geofence should be created include the server ID in the comparison as that is what is used everywhere else. Otherwise expanded zones are never added, and as a result high accuracy mode won't work as expected.

    Add throttling/debouncing on Wear OS for registry updates (#3517)

commit 7d6f11af4fc4508a7384cb4662da1719233ba7f8

    Add support for Assist pipeline, update Wear implementation (#3526)

    * Group incoming messages by subscription to prevent out-of-order delivery

     - Messages received on the websocket are processed asynchronously, which is usually fine but can cause issues if messages need to be received in a specific order for a subscription. To fix this, process messages in order for the same subscription.

    * Implement Assist pipeline API

     - Add basic support for the Assist pipeline API
     - Update conversation function to use the Assist pipeline when on the minimum required version
     - Update UI to refer to Assist pipeline requirement

    Fix expanded zone id for high accuracy zone constraint (#3509)

    - When checking if an expanded zone geofence should be created include the server ID in the comparison as that is what is used everywhere else. Otherwise expanded zones are never added, and as a result high accuracy mode won't work as expected.
