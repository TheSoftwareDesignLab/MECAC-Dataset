Use Bluetooth device address for high accuracy mode BT constraint, fixes settings crash (#2591)

* Don't include devices twice in Bluetooth list

 - Don't include Bluetooth devices twice in the devices list when using it for location-related functions. Do allow duplicates for the BT sensor for backwards compatibility.

* Switch high accuracy mode BT constraint to device address

 - Change the Bluetooth device constraint for high accuracy mode for location updates to use the Bluetooth device address instead of the device name to ensure uniqueness + fix crash in sensor settings screen
 - Set padding in Scaffold because lint doesn't seem to like ignoring it

* Migrate high accuracy mode BT constraint names to addresses

 - When enabling the high accuracy mode, make sure that all data for the Bluetooth device constraint is a Bluetooth device address and if not try to match it to a device.
 - Because the database can contain devices that are not currently paired/connected, without changing to a new setting this check always must be executed, which is why it is placed in the function for enabling the high accuracy mode.

* Also show user-friendly labels in sensor settings detail screen

 - Update the sensor settings detail screen to also show a user-friendly label for list settings on the main screen, before opening a dialog. This will use the same function as when the dialog info is populated, which simplifies code.
 - Merge SensorSettingType.LIST with other list types rows in sensor settings detail screen, remove getSettingTranslatedEntry in viewmodel which is no longer necessary.

* Fix empty Bluetooth list setting value when off
