Simplify themes (#2923)

* Merge Follow Home Assistant/Follow System Settings theme

 - As these two themes behave the same now, don't present two options but instead just one. The default setting has been renamed back to "Follow System Settings" to best match expectations. Internally the "android" setting still works, settings will show "Not set".

* Remove useless webview force dark

 - The WebView force dark settings are no longer required (and will no longer be supported when targeting Android 13), as the latest appcompat/webview/HA frontend already respect the app's theme setting and allow overriding it
