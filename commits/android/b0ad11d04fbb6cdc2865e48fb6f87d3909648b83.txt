Add troubleshooting tool: location history (#3886)

* Add location history (location, trigger, result)

 - Initial setup saving data, no UI, cleanup or preferences yet

* On/off setting, limit history size and basic UI

 - Add a on/off setting for location history (default on)
 - Limit the history size to 48 hours, any older entries will be deleted during regular sensor updates
 - Add a basic UI for location history based on paging considering the possible data size with multiserver/high accuracy. The list looks good and shows status at a glance, detail view still needs work.

* Finish expanded UI

 - Make the expanded UI nicer and show relevant data, buttons for opening the location in a maps app and sharing log data
 - Add empty states for location history

* Filter by state, improve list speed

 - Add option to filter by state
 - Simplify Room configuration and sort by indexed ID to improve list loading speed

* Remove duplicate source

* Fix minimal

* Split sent into sent and failed to send
