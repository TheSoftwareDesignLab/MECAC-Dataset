Android 13 notification changes + target (#2682)

* Request notification permission during onboarding

 - When using Android 13 or the minimal version, add a screen to onboarding to request to enable notifications on the device. This screen is based on iOS onboarding. When tapping Continue, on Android 13 this requests the system permission and/or on the minimal version this changes the websocket setting.
 - Compile with and target SDK 33 (targeting required to be able to request notification system permission on demand)

* Add notification settings link in settings when off

 - Show a new setting in settings for the user to enable notifications for the Home Assistant app, either because the permission was denied (Android 13) or the user manually turned off all notifications (Android 8-12).
 - This new setting replaces the notification channels setting when everything is off; in this case there is no point managing individual channels. If at least one channel is on, the existing notification channels setting is shown instead.

* Compose tweaks

 - Remove redundant content description for icon
 - Change to a simpler scroll modifier

* Fix skipping notifications on minimal version

 - Ensure that the value is actually saved to the database

* Post Bluetooth on/off commands as if invalid

 - When using Android 13, post notification commands to control Bluetooth on/off as a normal notification as if they were invalid, as the function has been deprecated for the app

* Remove type that can be inferred
