Replace deprecated MdcTheme with 'normal' theme matching XML theme (#4182)

- MdcTheme appears to have been deprecated in the latest release. Replace it with our own theme everywhere it is used. Thankfully, because the modifications for the HA (XML) theme are very minor compared to a default Material theme there's not a lot to define/duplicate.
