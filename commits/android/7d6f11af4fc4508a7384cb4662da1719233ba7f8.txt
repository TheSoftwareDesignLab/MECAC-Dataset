Add support for Assist pipeline, update Wear implementation (#3526)

* Group incoming messages by subscription to prevent out-of-order delivery

 - Messages received on the websocket are processed asynchronously, which is usually fine but can cause issues if messages need to be received in a specific order for a subscription. To fix this, process messages in order for the same subscription.

* Implement Assist pipeline API

 - Add basic support for the Assist pipeline API
 - Update conversation function to use the Assist pipeline when on the minimum required version
 - Update UI to refer to Assist pipeline requirement
