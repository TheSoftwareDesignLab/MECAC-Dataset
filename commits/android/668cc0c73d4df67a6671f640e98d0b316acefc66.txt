Update settings screens styling (#2393)

* Change toolbar/status bar for configuration

 - Change the colors used for the toolbar and status bar for configuration from the blue accent color to a white, to better match the default frontend theme

* Switch to AppCompat SearchView

* Update Wear settings' app bar, up everywhere

 - Update Wear settings' top app bar in the app to also use the white style and activity theme
 - Add up navigation to all screens in Wear settings

* Compose settings design consistency updates

 - When there is a scrollable column, use a scrollable Box instead around that column to make sure the padding is applied to the content instead of the entire scrollable container (which always gives padding at the top/bottom of the screen, even when content is scrolled)
 - Consistently use 16dp for content padding instead of a mix of 16 and 20; 16 matches the other non-Compose settings so let's use that
