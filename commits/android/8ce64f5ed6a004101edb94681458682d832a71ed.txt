Convert NFC tags interface to Compose and update design (#2441)

* Convert NFC tags interface to Compose

 - Rebuild the NFC tags interface with Compose instead of multiple fragments, move more functionality to the NfcViewModel
 - Design updates to match other settings screens (white top app bar, additional icons, don't use text inputs for showing data)
 - Update strings for consistency
 - Update Navigation version to latest stable, and remove non-Compose dependency because it is no longer required

* Update NFC trigger example

 - Add slightly more text to explain how to use it as a trigger in the visual automation editor, which most users will use
 - Add an easier example for scanning the tag, and rename the existing example to clarify that it is only for this device

* Add link to tag documentation to top app bar

* Handle NFC turned off

 - Check to see if NFC is actually turned on when the user opens settings, and prompt them to turn it on if required. Also do the same for the tag writing screen because that might be opened directly by the frontend.
 - Update strings to always use 'device' instead of a mix of 'device' and 'phone'

* Add option to change ID written to tag

 - Allow the user to change the ID that is written to the NFC tag when using the 'write tag' button from the app settings, to match frontend and iOS which also allow the user to change the tag ID

* Don't allow setting state outside NfcViewModel

* Simplify device trigger example even further

* Don't duplicate tag data extraction code

* Also convert tag reader activity to Compose

 - Shouldn't be seen in most cases by users
