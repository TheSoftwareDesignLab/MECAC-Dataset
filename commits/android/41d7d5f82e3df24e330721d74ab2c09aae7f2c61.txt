Sensor Refactor (#809)

* Persist all sensor data so we can make UI reflect last sent sensor data.

* No value can be null.

* UI now uses database rather than new values.

* Sensors are now async and UI uses entities rather than actually polling sensors.

* Opening sensor ui now causes us to request sensor updates every 10 seconds.

* Fix minimal build.

* Don't just poll the sensors, send updates to HA.
