Fix gesture detection on WebViewActivity (#2396)

* Fix gesture detection on WebViewActivity

 - Add actual gesture detection to the webview instead of pointer detection in order to fix the search box showing up any time 3 fingers are placed on the screen

* Remove nullable min/max velocity

 - These always get a value so there is no need to make them initially nullable

* Cleanup fling detection

* Reduce minimum swipe velocity requirement

* Change direction calculation to average

 - Use the average velocity of all pointers to determine in which direction the user has swiped. The previous implementation used the first/last pointer's angle which isn't necessarily the same pointer.
 - Fix reducing number of pointers when velocity tracker is reset due to an opposing pointer
