Split app-level and server-level settings (#3241)

* Move server settings to a server settings screen

 - Move server-specific settings to a new screen to be accessed from the main settings only containing server specific settings in preparation for multiserver
 - Sensors is currently not server-specific even though one setting is stored by server ID, to be fixed later

* Store app preferences in another shared preferences file

 - Store app preferences not in the integration shared preferences file, but in the shared preferences file for general prefs (it is named themes but there are already other app-level prefs in it)
 - Move Wear specific preferences to it's own repository + shared preferences file

* Improve server row with local data

 - While we don't have a server name or user name, show the registration name when available to improve the server row layout

* Simplify location permission request code

 - Remove the flexible permission requests as it isn't used in the current settings structure, only expect location permissions
 - Switch from the deprecated functions to the new flow using activity result contracts

* Remove unused string
