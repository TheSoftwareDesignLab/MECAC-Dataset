Fix button widget authentication dismissed due to non-foreground window (#4066)

- Fixes the button widget authentication dialog automatically being dismissed when triggered on Android 14 QPR1+, because the window was not in the foreground. It looks like the framework check for this was bugged before QPR1, and the Home Assistant app was showing the authentication dialog before the window (which is transparent) was in the foreground.
