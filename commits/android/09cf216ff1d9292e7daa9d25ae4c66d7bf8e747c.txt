Remove toast when updating state/camera/template widget fails (#2262)

* Hide toast when updating state/camera/template widget fails

* Change icon to remove cloud/network emphasis

 - The error can also be because the selected entity no longer exists and/or the device failed to handle the response, so use a more generic error while refreshing icon

* Change return type for resolve text to prevent race condition

 - Don't leak widget-specific calls in to a general variable, use a data class in order to be able to return two different data types
