Entity state complication improvements (more flexibility) (#3465)

* Add ComplicationType.LONG_TEXT support, friendly state

 - Makes it possible for watch faces to request a long text complication
 - Use the friendly state to support translated states and dates

* Add show title option

 - Allows hiding the title of a complication in case it doesn't look right

* Implement/fix reading state from database

 - When a entity ID is provided in the configuration request, load data for that complication from the database to allow easy reconfiguration
 - Provide more appropriate error messages when complication isn't configured / the entity doesn't exist
