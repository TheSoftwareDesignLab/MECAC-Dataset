Migrate "Manage Sensors" to Compose and ViewModels (#2359)

* Replace PreferenceFragment sensors list with Compose

 - Start of migrating the list of sensors and their individual on/off settings to Compose by moving the list over
 - Aims to replicate original design of the page for now

* Rename ViewModel to match view

* Start of sensor detail screen in Compose

 - Add enabled switch and description + permission handling
 - Update main list to use new Compose-based fragment
 - Add new fragments to factory to prevent crash on recreation

* More sensor info to show

 - Add more properties and attributes for the sensor (basically anything that doesn't require a pop-up)
 - Move enabled check with permissions to ViewModel because it also needs to be updated in the database
 - Fix collecting sensor settings

* Add support for sensor settings toggle/text/number

 - Added a framework for setting sensor settings; toggle builds on the existing on/off toggle, and added a MutableState for settings that require the app to show a dialog
 - Support for changing sensor settings that must be toggled
 - Support for changing sensor settings where text or number input is required

* Finish sensor details by adding list-based settings

 - Add support for setting list-based settings
 - Dynamic maximum height for dialog in order to fill most of the screen
 - Remove old fragment and XML since all functionality should now be covered
 - Show translated setting for list settings
 - Fix update of list setting removing the list options in the future, because they were stored in the DB entry but a new entry without any values was created
 - Fix toggle sensor setting (removed the space)

* Tweak single rows with switch and height

 - Don't use two line row height if there is no summary
 - Remove onCheckedChange from Switch so that it is handled by the row
 - Prevent text from getting too close to switch

* UI fixes and tweaks

 - Fix search query still being set when returning to the main sensors list after viewing a sensor's details by clearing the query in the view model if the SearchView is closed
 - Move sorting the sensors for each manager to the UI where the sensors are queried, instead of in an internal variable
 - Set secondary color to allow Switches, RadioButtons and Checkboxes to use the blue HA tint without overriding each one manually
 - Add stable IDs to main sensor list to improve recomposition for search

* Allow selecting some rows in details

* Move dialog popup into a separate file

 - Move the dialog that is used to a separate file because it was already based on a custom dialog for the Manage Widgets screen.
 - Improve max height for dialog by using weight, to make sure it still works correctly for longer titles
 - When using radio button items, don't require the user to press save but instead save it when an item is selected

* Show disabled state for sensor setting rows

* Update unchecked switch thumb colors

 - Google says using the same color as the surface with a minimal shaodw is by design, https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/185418990, but it just results in bad contrast (probably why they switched to a different switch design in Android 12), so manually copied the color code to use

* Also use disabled state for sensor setting row summary

* Fix comment
