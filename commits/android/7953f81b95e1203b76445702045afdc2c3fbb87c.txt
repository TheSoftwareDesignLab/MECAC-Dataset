Fix websocket stays subscribed after widget edit due to multiple instances (#2753)

* Fix websocket stays subscribed after widget edit due to multiple instances

 - When a widget is edited, the system will send a broadcast to _a new instance_ of the widget class. Because there is a websocket connection to keep widgets updated, the new instance of the class should also receive events to unsubscribe.

* Use companion object to prevent unnecessary updates

 - Only actually start listening for updates in one of the instances in order to prevent unnecessary duplicate widget updates
