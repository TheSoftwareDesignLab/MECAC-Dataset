Allow treating ethernet and VPN as home network/for internal URL (#4872)

* Allow using internal based on ethernet/VPN

 - Add the option (in code) to use internal url based on the current connection being ethernet or having a VPN, instead of specific SSIDs.

* Add ethernet/VPN instead of replace for internal

 - Make ethernet/VPN an additional reason to consider a network internal, not alternative to SSIDs. The values default to null so we can change the default later or introduce a 3-way switch.

* Add UI, update other features to use correct check

 - Updates the SSID view UI to be the home network management UI
 - Update app lock/BLE monitor to check internal instead of home Wi-Fi SSID

* String consistency: WiFi -> Wi-Fi

* Fix typo

* Add warning about unintentional home network matching

 - Adds a warning based on PR comments about how incorrect home network settings can unintentionally expose information
 - Small refactor to allow for a different colored alert (info instead of warning)

* animateItem for warning
