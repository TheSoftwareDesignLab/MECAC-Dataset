Update to Kotlin 1.9/Compose 1.5/Compose Wear 1.2/AGP 8.1.1 (#3814)

- Update to Kotlin 1.9
 - Update to Compose 1.5 and Compose Wear 1.2, both depend on and are required for Kotlin 1.9. Compose Wear includes lazy classes moving to a different package so updated imports.
 - Update to AGP 8.1.1 to remove compatibility warning
 - Update Navigation Compose to 2.7.1 as it uses Compose 1.5 internally
 - Update Accompanist to 0.32 as it uses Compose 1.5 internally
 - Switch Room to KSP instead of kapt because this (latest stable) release doesn't work with Kotlin 1.9 otherwise. As a result, we no longer need to specifically enable incremental compilation.
