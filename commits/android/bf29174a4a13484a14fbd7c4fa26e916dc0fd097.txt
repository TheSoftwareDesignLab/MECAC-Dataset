Minimal Android Flavor (#682)

* Initial rip out of most of the Googley stuff.

* Lokalise plugin and dependencies removed.
They would be more useful if we had a large app with many translations.  However, with most of our UI being a PWA the usefulness of it is very limited.

* Both apps now build.... Yay

* Formatting.

* Tests and checks pass.

* Make sure Github Actions are up to date.

* Fix more unit tests.

* ktLint

* Use config class for gradle dependencies.
