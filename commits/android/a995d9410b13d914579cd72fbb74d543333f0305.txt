Support multiple subscriptions of same type in websocket and use in template widget (#2801)

* Update WebSocketRepository for multiple subscriptions of same type

 - Change the structure of how the websocket repository tracks individual subscriptions to allow subscribing multiple times with the same type, but different data

* Update TemplateWidget to use template subscriptions

 - Instead of depending on entity state changes and refreshing any time there is a change, use the render_template subscription for the template widget to limit the amount of data and power used. To make this possible without too much abstractions, the TemplateWidget no longer implements BaseWidgetProvider.
 - Fix hardcoded "Loading" string

* Handle potential null subscription ID

 - Implements #2795 for changes to tracked subscription ID

* Handle failed subscribing similar to other failures (null)

 - When subscribing fails, return null and don't store an active subscription instead of continuing and returning a flow (which would never emit messages)

* Update manifest
