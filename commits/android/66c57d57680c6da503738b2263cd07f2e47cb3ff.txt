Add theming to widgets: Dynamic color (Material You) and Transparent (#2496)

* Add transparent widgets

 - Add options to the service, entity and template widgets to have a transparent background
 - Register configuration change intent filter for widgets in order to be able to respond to day/night changes (no longer fully automatic due to setting color with int)

* Support Material You dynamic color in widgets

 - In widgets that support theming (day/night or transparent), add an option to use Material You dynamic colors
 - Dynamic colors is now the default widget style for new widgets on devices that support them

* Tweak dynamic color theming

 - Update dynamic color values to better match other themed widgets such as those from Google
 - Remove configuration changed intent receiver for widgets because it is no longer required to get colors

* Add dynamic color theming to media player widget

 - Make the media player widget themeable and add an option to use dynamic colors (transparent doesn't make sense for this layout)

* Fix camera widget background if data cannot be loaded

* Add text size option to template widgets

 - Added an option to set the text size to template widgets to better align with other widget options

* Additional Android 12 widget updates

 - When using the dynamic color theme, also use the new Android 12 widget corner radius
 - Update placeholder values in widgets to match images, and refer to dynamic color XML to provide a better preview on Android 12. Reset values when providing template to match existing behaviour when no widget is found in the database.
 - Update entity state and template widget target size to 2x1 to match preview image
 - Make sure media player album art doesn't extend past corner radius if possible

* Change theme selection to dropdown, text color alignment

 - Change theme selection to use a dropdown menu (Spinner) instead of right-aligned radio buttons on multiple lines
 - Change text color selection to left-align radio buttons
