Show entity state on chip background (#2634)

* Show entity state on entity chip in Wear OS app

 - Shows the color and position of an entity state on the entity's chip in the Wear OS app by using a custom background class that accepts more than a single Color

* Use horizontal instead of diagonal gradients

 - The default BrushPainter actually isn't the correct one, the ToggleChip class uses its own but that is marked as internal and we cannot override the default BrushPainter so another copied class it is

* RTL entity position support

 - When using an RTL language, the entity chip should fill in the position value from the right side

* Support cover position

 - Show cover position as entity chip's background
 - Adjust background color code to also work when a chip isn't checked for covers that are currently closing

* Cleanup EntityUi

* Cleanup duplicate code in device controls

* Naming conventions

 - Should've used a lowercase letter to start
 - Fix class

* Fix build

 - Updates because ToggleChipColors has changed
 - Add workaround for implementing Compose interface because kotlin-gradle-plugin is linked to stable Compose and we cannot update yet

* Update gradient values to match rc02

 - Wear Compose 1.0.0-rc02 changed the default values for the gradients in ToggleChips, so update the values used when using a custom background to match
