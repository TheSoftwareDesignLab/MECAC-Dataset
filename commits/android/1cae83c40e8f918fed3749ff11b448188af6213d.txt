Implement native Assist (#3589)

* Native Assist setup + text input

* Minor (text input) UI tweaks and fixes

 - Set a very light window tint to increase contrast on white backgrounds
 - Keyboard to outline for consistency
 - Text input: keyboard action, keyboard icon to outline for consistency, show keyboard when switching
 - Fix reset conversation on recreation

* Voice input

 - Add basic voice input support to the native Assist interface

* Voice input bugfixes

 - Don't block voice output while sending data via websocket
 - Drop voice output data if there is a subscriber and the buffer is full by specifying a buffer + overflow strategy that matches behavior when there are no subscribers
 - Properly stop AudioRecord reading when job is cancelled (non-suspending function)
 - Stop recorder before stopping output collection

* Voice responses (generated TTS) playback

 - Play received tts-end events when using voice input
 - Update permission info on resume to catch granted permissions while in the background

* Pipeline switcher

 - Allow switching between all different pipelines
 - Add icon content descriptions

* Check + show attribution

* Prevent sheet that is too high pushing controls away

* UI feedback: pipelines and attribution

* Update Automotive manifest

* Fix speech bubble size for larger responses

* Update manifest to handle tasks/backstack better

 - Set the affinity to a value to make sure Assist is always launched in another task than the main app
 - Automatically remove from recents as Assist will be the only thing in it's task, after finishing there's nothing left to (re)start

* App-specific feature checks and error handling

 - Check for microphone support on device
 - Handle connectivity errors
 - Handle argument errors
 - Handle errors for pipelines that are no longer visible

* More UI feedback

 - Add a title to the sheet to make sure people know this is the Home Assistant app
 - Fix TextField alignment

* More header means max height adjustment
