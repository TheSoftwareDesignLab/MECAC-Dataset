Implement a frontend-like single entity picker (#3653)

* Implement a frontend-like single entity picker

 - Adds a new Composable `SingleEntityPicker` which aims to provide a text input with autocomplete search for entities like the frontend, where you can pick one

* Improve filtering to allow suggestions with space, searching for entity IDs

 - Trim search input so the space automatically added after an IME suggestion is ignored
 - Also search entity ID but sort those results second, friendly name keeps priority
