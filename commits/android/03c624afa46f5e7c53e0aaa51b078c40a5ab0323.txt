Wide screen onboarding: center text, limit width (#4697)

* Wide screen onboarding: center text, limit width

 - Improvements to the onboarding for wide screens
   - Center width on initial screen to prevent odd alignment of a single line
   - Limit the content width on onboarding screens to 600dp centered, like other step flows/bottom sheets
   - Update padding values on initial onboarding screen to match 8dp grid used in all other places

* Don't forget the manual address entry screen
