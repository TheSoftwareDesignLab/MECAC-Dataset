Update Kotlin to 1.6 and Compose to 1.1 (#2372)

* Update Kotlin to 1.6 and Compose to 1.1

 - Remove @ExperimantalComposeUiApi, @ExperimentalWearMaterialApi annotations (because the functions aren't experimental, we are just using an experimental API) and replace with an opt-in declaration at the 'lowest level' usage
 - Websocket: ProducerScope is no longer experimental so the annotation can be completely removed
 - Wear: the animation APIs that are used for the time text are no longer experimental so the annotation can be completely removed

* Update for Compose sensor settings merge
