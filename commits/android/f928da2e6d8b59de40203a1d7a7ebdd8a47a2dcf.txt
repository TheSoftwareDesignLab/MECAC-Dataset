Matter dependency update and tweaks for shared devices + errors (#3161)

* Update Matter dependency

* Improve shared device commissioning

 - Show device name if available
 - Show error codes if returned

* Show toast for commissioning request errors

 - When an error occurs for commissioning requests/before the Play Services UI is shown, show a toast informing the user that Matter is currently unavailable. Most user-facing errors will be shown in the Play Services UI (during commissioning).
