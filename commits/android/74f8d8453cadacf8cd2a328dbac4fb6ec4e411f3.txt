Replace huge camera widget example image with a sensible sized one (#2028)

Looking at the built apk, about 12% of the whole download size was being
accounted for by a huge image, that is only used to give an example image
in the camera widget.

Two methods have reduced this to an insignificant size now:
- use a lower resolution image, no need for this to be many megapixels
- store it as a jpg, which is great for photos, rather than a png
