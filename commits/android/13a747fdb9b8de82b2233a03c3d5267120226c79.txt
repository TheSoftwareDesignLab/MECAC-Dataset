Notification sensors: make arrays and bundles within main bundle readable (#2482)

* Notification sensors: convert extra bundle arrays to lists

 - If the notification extras contain any arrays, convert them to lists because when stringified, this will create a human readable text like "[Message 1, Message 2]" instead of something like "[Ljava.lang.String;@5d099f62"

* Convert BaseBundle arrays to lists as well

 - Include array types that are in the superclass BaseBundle as well when converting values to a list
 - Moved to another function to limit duplicated code

* Map bundles within a notification's bundle as well

 - Also map any bundles we find inside a bundle, or if there is an array of bundles, to make this information readable as well
