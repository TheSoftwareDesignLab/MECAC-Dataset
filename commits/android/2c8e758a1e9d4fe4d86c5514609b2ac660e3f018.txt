Make gestures configurable (+ breaking: swap left/right) (#5512)

* Add configurable gestures

 - Add a setting for gesture actions depending on the directions and number of pointers. (UI to follow later.)
 - Change default for left/right swipe with 3 pointers to match iOS.

* Add settings screen for gestures

 - Add a new "Gestures" screen to configure the configurable webview gestures.
 - Change gestures to a list of enums so all possible combinations are known in advance (and we can do migrations if needed).
 - Extract list subheader to SettingsSubheader composable

* Screenshot tests for new common composables

* Add another enum for GesturePointers

* Add tests for gesture defaults/none/customized
