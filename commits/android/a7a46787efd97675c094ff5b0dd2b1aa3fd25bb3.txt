Fix widget service calls with numbers (#640) (#650)

* Widget service calls will fail, if a number for any field is used.
Because the GSON parser will parse every integer to a double.
This is especially a problem on the service alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm
which needs a code to disarm the alarm panel.
So every code will be converted to .0 (eg. 1234 would be 1234.0)
Solution: Use Jackson instead of gson
GSON problem described here (not fixed):
