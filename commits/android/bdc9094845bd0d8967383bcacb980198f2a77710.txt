Improve adding quick settings tile (#2860)

* Improve adding quick settings tiles

 - Use the new option available on Android 13 to prompt the user to add a tile to the quick settings panel, if a tile wasn't already added
 - Switch Toast to Snackbar
 - Move some logic from the manage tiles view to viewmodel

* Only show subtitle field when supported

 - Setting a tile subtitle is only supported on Android Q+, so don't show the field on versions before that!

* Deeplink into app for tiles that aren't setup

 - Instead of disabling a tile if it isn't setup, if the user is logged in set it up as inactive with the default icon/label and deeplink into the app settings with a notice that it needs to be setup first. This provides a better first use experience, as the user can simply tap it to setup instead of requiring them to manually go to the settings.
