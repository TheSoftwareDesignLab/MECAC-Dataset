Improve Manage sensors list and details screens (#2418)

* Add sticky headers to manage sensors list

 - The list of managers, and for some managers the list of sensors, is getting so long that sticky headers while scrolling is nice to have to quickly see where you are when doing a fast scroll
 - Remove useless sorting of managers, original list is already sorted

* Include manager name in manage sensors search

 - Also match sensors when using the search function in the manage sensors list when their manager's name matches the search query. This will for example allow searching for all audio sensors, or finding high accuracy mode when searching for location.

* Add stateless/fallback/default icons to sensors

 - Add a new stateless icon to sensors that is used as a default/fallback within the UI
 - Add icons for sensors to the main list of sensors, blue like in the frontend when enabled and disabled alpha when disabled
 - Name deviceClass and unitOfMeasurement arguments where used in sensors

* Fix sensor a-z sorting

* Show entity in details screen more like frontend

 - Update the design for the entity details screen to closer match what is shown in the frontend; at the top of the screen there is now a card that mimics the layout of the entity on the (default) dashboard. This includes the icon (no longer text only), name (previously completely absent from this screen) and the state. Enable/disable is now better highlighted.
 - Some technical information was removed, in line with making this page less like a database dump (use dev tools if that's required).

* Show 'None selected' for empty multi-list preferences

* Add info about update frequency to BasicSensor

 - Adds information about the update frequency to a BasicSensor
 - Change design for sensor details to better highlight description, and add a chip that shows current sensor update frequency taking into account app settings and Android version

* Change description on Sensor Update Frequency screen

* Fix description

* Change update type for detected activity sensor

 - This uses a callback on a ~2 minute interval but can be more frequent when other apps are using the API. Worker updates only re-register the callback.

* Revert "Change update type for detected activity sensor"

 - It might be updated faster but doesn't actually send new values any faster
