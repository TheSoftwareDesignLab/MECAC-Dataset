* First cut add BLE beacon as new sensor.

* Lint issues, also using hardcoded strings for state.

* Fixes and small tidies following review.

* Add command_ble_transmitter to MessagingService.kt, to control BLE Transmitter from HA notifications.

* Make description more specific for settings.

* Return if sensor not enabled

* Spaced.

* Command turn on for transmitter should stop it first, as state could be incorrect on Bluetooth being disabled.

* Add 2 new settings:
  - Power transmitter values between high and ultra low.  Defaults to ultra low, should help with Battery concerns
  - A setting which allows the sensor to be turned on by default when the Enable all toggle is turned on.  This is off by default, users have to actively seek out this sensor to turn it on.

* Add battery warning to description.

* Fix build - stray merge comma deletion.

* Fix small description text error.
