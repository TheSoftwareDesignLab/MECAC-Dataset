Epsilon for line simplification was using incorrect value - now much nicer

Fixed a bug related to the distance used for line reduction. The previous value of zoom was being used, instead
of the new value. This kind of explains why I could see line reduction changes more than I though I should have
been able to. Now it's looking very nice. I don't think there will be many more changes. If any.
