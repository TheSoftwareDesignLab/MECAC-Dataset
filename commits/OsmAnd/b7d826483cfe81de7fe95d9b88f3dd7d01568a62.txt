Paint/context preserving local state

I got to thinking that the paint variable state should be preserved after the drawing functions did their stuff. Saving
and restoring individual values inside each function was getting messy, so I implemented a local paint variable which
was updated with the important stuff from the passed-in paints. The local variable is now used for all painting/drawing
and the original paint guaranteed unchanged. I could see issues elsewhere if I changed something and other code
was assuming it was already set.  So, quite a bit of fiddling with the code to get this working, but now it's clean.

I also did a bit of work on the arrows - see video at https://youtu.be/wvE9HUDMqSM

Basically they're much nicer, but also they are coloured. It's just an experimental thing, where the colour is based
upon the distance along the track; using the same rainbow scaling as the altitude display does; that is... purple up
to red.
