Rewrote the standard GPX track draw/clipping

It's a lot simpler - and a lot faster, I'm sure.  Basically it didn't need to be as complex as it was, and mostly
the 'hard stuff' it was solving is actually fairly easily handled by the draw. So. Seems to be working fine.
There are other little tweaks here and there as I test out the system.
The renderers need to behave under density and zoom changes; so that would be the widths of things should scale
properly, and the look of some of them leave a bit to be desired. However, it's the system that is now fully
functional, and work on the renderers can come later.  The main track draw seems pretty solid.
