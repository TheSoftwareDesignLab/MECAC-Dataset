Add support for online tile source template URLs with only bounding box

Some online map data sources do not have native support for tiled web map
(slippy map) requests. A common way of operating without the tile zoom/x/y
triplet is to specify a lat/lon bounding box in the tile request.

Previously, as a workaround, osmand suggested pointing at a redirecting
proxy that would rewrite requests for zoom/x/y tiles with an equivalent request
for a bounding box (i.e. http://whoots.mapwarper.net/tms)

Instead of this workaround, implement this functionality natively by adding
a "{bbox}" parameter to templated tile URLs, which will be replaced at request
time with the tile's lat/lon bounding box.

Examples of services that use the templated bounding box method:
1) ArcGIS rest service:

2) WMS:
