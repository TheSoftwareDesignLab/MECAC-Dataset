use HTTPS URL for sharing location

In order to maintain privacy when sharing location, this changes the shared
location link to use HTTPS, thereby hiding the location info from anyone
who might be snooping on the WiFi, ISP, internet, etc.

Unfortunately, http://osm.org does not yet work with HTTPS, but the
standard OSM URLs are short enough to fit into a text message. They are
planning on supporting https://osm.org in the future:
