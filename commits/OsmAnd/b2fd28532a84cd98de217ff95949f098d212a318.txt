English string correctness, typo and style fixes

e14d7518 and 554e433c changed many English strings. Many of the changes
(use of active voice, clearer phrasing, some simplification) were good, but
others introduced unusual style, inconsistencies in the UI, and strange
language.

Some examples:

* import_gpx_file_description: was "can be imported as Favorites, or as track
file.", changed to "can be imported as favorite, or track file.". The new
phrase doesn't take into account that OsmAnd has a concept or feature called
"Favorites", so when referring to that, an initial capital letter should be
used, and that a track can have many waypoints, so it's more appropriate to use
"Favorites" (plural).

* Several strings containing colons have been changed such that the initial
letter of the word immediately following the colon is in uppercase. For
example, osm_live_banner_desc now contains "once a month: Weekly, daily, or
hourly". Capitalising the first letter in "Weekly" is not correct.

* Inconsistencies have been introduced, for example changing "underlay" (as in
"underlay map" to "underlaying"). The "Configure map" menu now is now
inconsistent as it contains "Overlay map" and "Underlaying map".

* Typos have been introduced, for example "doens\'t" instead of "doesn\'t".

* "Start time" and "End time" (used in GPX analysis, for example) are now
"Departure" and "Arrival" which makes little sense in this context.

Also fixes #5566.
