- fix for rotation in move mode. Rotation is done in separate cycle so it is not stopped when the animation is.
 mapView.setLanLon stops the animation thread, from this point of view, the animation view is not the right place for
 animating the rotation. In other hands, every map change setRotation,setLanLon,zoom could go through animation thread
 and it would be unified somehow with any future animation.
