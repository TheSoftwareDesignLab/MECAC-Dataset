Avoid blocking of street list (during address search) in landscape mode with large soft-keyboard by changing imeOptions.

!!! This makes address search finally more usable on e.g. in-car head units !!!

 Additionally added minor layout changes to squeeze the street list in landscape mode (less line separator height and margin).
