"Massive" optimisation - on-demand culling for GPX tracks

A bit of inspiration; rather than trigger the culling for tracks when they are loaded and every time you zoom
(i.e, creating the resampled or simplified tracks such as standard track (Ramer Douglas Peucer line reduction), arrows,
speed, markers (all resample)... now the system uses the bounding rectangle of the original track to trigger the cull(s)
only when the track is onscreen and viewable. This now allows dozens of tracks to be loaded without initial slowdown
caused by all those resamplers and cullers running in the background. It's an on-demand system, in other words.

So, whereas previously if you had 20 GPX tracks loaded, and you zoomed in/out, then all 20 of those tracks would start
a Ramer-Douglas-Peucer resize, which would significantly slow down the whole thing (even though they are asynchronous
they do take a toll on performance).  Now, when you zoom in/out, only visible tracks (or ones which become visible)
will start the RDP resize.
