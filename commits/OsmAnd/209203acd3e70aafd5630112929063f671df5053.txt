Resample of Arrows, Speed, Altitude and Conveyor enabled

By enabling on-zoom resampling of arrows, speed, altitude and conveyor data it is possible to more effectively
tailor the visuals of these renderers. For example, the altitude and speed are point-reduced based on zoom, and now
look much cleaner at low zoom values.  Likewise, the arrows are now rendered at consistent size regardless of
zoom. Also, the conveyor segments are similar length onscreen regardless of zoom. During a zoom change, the
prevoiusly resampled track is killed, so there is a brief flash while the appropriate track is resampled. This
appeared visually better than drawing the old track with incorrect spacing/scaling.
