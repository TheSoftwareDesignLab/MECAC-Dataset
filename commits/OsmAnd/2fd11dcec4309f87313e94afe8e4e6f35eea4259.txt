Rename sleep mode -> background mode. The best expression - 'app is running in background'. So far some people confused that OsmAnd falls into a sleep and they click on notification, which actually stops it completely. The indication should be that OsmAnd is running in background (so it could use battery or record gpx or pronounce navigation instruction)
