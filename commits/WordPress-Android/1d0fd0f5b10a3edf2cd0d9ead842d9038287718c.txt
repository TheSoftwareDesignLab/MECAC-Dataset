Fixes a few bugs:

 * Adds boolean to track if posts are being fetched, so we don't fire multiple requests if you scroll to the bottom over and over again.
 * Fixes issue where post would hang around after being deleted if it was the last post in the post list.
 * Removed instance variable of PostsActivity
