Manual tweaking of release notes (too long)

 - Shorten es-ES manually, as even the release_notes_short version was too long after all
 - nl-NL and sv-SE translations for JP were too long too. Since for this release WP and JP have the same release notes, I replaced the nl-NL and sv-SE translation for the JP ones with the ones from WP.
