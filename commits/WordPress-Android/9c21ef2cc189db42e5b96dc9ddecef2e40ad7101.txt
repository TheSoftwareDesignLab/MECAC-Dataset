Test: Resolve blaze campaign model parameter target urn related warnings

Warning: "No value passed for parameter 'targetUrn'"

FYI: These 'BlazeCampaignModel' test compile errors are unrelated to the
theme payload changes and only started to appear because 'FluxC' got
updated to that version where there is now a new 'targetUrn' constructor
argument on this model.

PS: At some point, WPAndroid should get updated accordingly anyway, but
until then this commit will at least fix any testing related CI issues.
