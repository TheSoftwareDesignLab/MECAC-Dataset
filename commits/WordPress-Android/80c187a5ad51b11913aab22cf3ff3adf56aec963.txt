Pass correct value to setInitialScreenFromMySiteDefaultTabExperimentVariant

1. It seems we were comparing initial screen label with variant tracking label on preference change. Since site menu label is changed to menu, this commit adjusts comparison of changed preference value with the correct value.

2. APP_SETTINGS_INITIAL_SCREEN_CHANGED -> "selected" value tracks variant tracking labels (dashboard, site_menu). It matches corresponding tracking in iOS.

3. Passing variant tracking label to setInitialScreenFromMySiteDefaultTabExperimentVariant via AppSettingsFragment.onPreferenceChange and initial screen value from MySiteDefaultTabExperiment.checkAndSetVariantIfNeeded looked incorrect. This commit passes variant tracking label from both places to setInitialScreenFromMySiteDefaultTabExperimentVariant() where it gets converted to the initial screen label (reflecting function's true purpose).
