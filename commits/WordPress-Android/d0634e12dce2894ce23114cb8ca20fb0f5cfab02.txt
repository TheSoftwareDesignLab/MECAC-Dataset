Remove redundant EditorFragmentListener assignment in GutenbergKitEditorFragment (#22150)

The base class `GutenbergKitEditorFragmentBase` already assigns `mEditorFragmentListener`
in its `onAttach()` method. The child class was redundantly reassigning it after calling
`super.onAttach()`, which serves no purpose.

This cleanup was missed during PR #22144 when the `EditorDragAndDropListener` assignment
was removed. The fix should have only removed the drag-and-drop listener without adding
a redundant `EditorFragmentListener` assignment.

Changes:
- Remove unnecessary `mEditorFragmentListener` assignment in `onAttach()`
- Base class assignment via `super.onAttach()` is sufficient
