Analysis: Add missing n-a to comment wp com theme response fields

FYI: 'n-a' stands for 'nullability annotations'.

PS: This 'NotNullFieldNotInitialized' warning got suppressed because a
'response' class can never have its fields initialized via a constructor
initialization, or otherwise for that matter.
