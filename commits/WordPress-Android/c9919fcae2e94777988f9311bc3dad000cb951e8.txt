feat: Improve app password required dialog (#22196)

* refactor: Relocate ApplicationPasswordReauthenticateDialogPreview

Remove from abstract class to fix Jetpack Compose preview error: "render
error."

* refactor: Extract ApplicationPasswordDialog for Jetpack Compose preview

Preview the actual UI code used by the app, rather than a copy of the
dialog composition.

* feat: Add ApplicationPasswordDialog dismiss button

Communicate the dialog may be dismissed.

* fix: Use consistent punctuation

While Material's guidelines state to avoid unnecessary punctuation, all
examples that have one more than one sentence use punctuation for all
sentences.
