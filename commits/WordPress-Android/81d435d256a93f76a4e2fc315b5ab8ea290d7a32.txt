Improve notes moderation flow (#4747)

* Update the note when the moderation ends with success, by calling the GET on the REST API, and refresh the value in the DB.
Also updates the UI accordingly.

* Check before overwrite a note into the DB, since CONFLICT_REPLACE conflict resolution strategy could delete the row in order to satisfy a constraint, and it does not invoke delete triggers on the row.

* Remove debugging code.

* Make sure to check rows existence if we call `saveNotes` with `clearBeforeSaving` = false.
