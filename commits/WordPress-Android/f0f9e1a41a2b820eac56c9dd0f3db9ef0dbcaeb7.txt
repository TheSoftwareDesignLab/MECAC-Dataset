Cleaned up some code in WordPressDB:

 * Moved theme table creation out of the upgrade process to where it belonged with where the other tables are created.
 * Removed EULA table references along with preferences migration function since it isn't being used any longer.
 * Change gigantic 'if' statement for updating tables to a switch statement. Uses much less code and should be just as efficient. Props @maxme for the idea.
