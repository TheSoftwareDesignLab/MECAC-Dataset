Restore "Update strings.xml"

This reverts commit 8a83dc5219aca2119866e0fca11f8608f5ef85aa and restores 4c3b085742eec1aa8509bfd2f0aa5bed030af2bc

The reason initially stated for 4c3b085742eec1aa8509bfd2f0aa5bed030af2bc was misleading, as it stated those strings had to be removed “because they were moved into the library since”.
But our translation pipeline still requires the strings used by our internal binary dependencies (GBM, Login, Stories, About libs) to be merged into the app’s main `strings.xml` (which our release-toolkit takes care of during code-freeze), in order for those strings to be imported into GlotPress and translated.

After investigating further, those strings still need to be removed indeed (which is why this commit restores their removal after all), but NOT because “they were moved into the library”, and instead because those strings keys don’t exist in the 0.0.4 version of the library anymore, and got renamed to something else (mostly adding the `*_item_title` suffix to most of them, see https://github.com/Automattic/about-automattic-android/commit/ea6045821722c67b4235fd7121d5ac619dac4a1c). This is the real reason why those old and now unused keys need to be removed.

Note that during next code freeze, the new names of those keys (with `*_item_title`) will be added to the `strings.xml` of the app to get those new names translated via GlotPress (even if in practice the translators will get the translated copy from the old keys suggested to them from the translation memory, making it easy for them to use the translation from the old keys as the one to use for the renamed keys)
