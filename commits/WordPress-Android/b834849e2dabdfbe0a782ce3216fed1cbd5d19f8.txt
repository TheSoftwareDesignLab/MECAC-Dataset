Finish the WordPress app when starting JP migration

This commit makes sure the WordPress app will not longer open after users tap the `Try the new Jetpack app` button and afterwards they navigate back using any means. The WordPress app still remains in the list of recent apps, thus giving us more confidence regressions in the migration flow are not introduced.
