Clean up `GutenbergKitActivity` and enable navigation routing (#22141)

* Update EditorLauncher to route to GutenbergKitActivity

Implements feature flag-based routing in EditorLauncher to direct users to
GutenbergKitActivity instead of EditPostActivity when GutenbergKit should be used.

This completes the navigation handling for the GutenbergKit migration by ensuring
the EditorLauncher (the centralized editor entry point) routes to the correct
activity based on feature flags.

Changes:
- Replace hardcoded EditPostActivity routing with conditional logic
- Route to GutenbergKitActivity when shouldUseGutenbergKitEditor() returns true
- Maintain existing analytics tracking for feature flag decisions

* Remove isGutenbergKitEditor property from GutenbergKitActivity

Since GutenbergKitActivity will always use the GutenbergKit editor, the
isGutenbergKitEditor boolean property is redundant and can be removed.

Changes:
- Remove isGutenbergKitEditor property declaration
- Remove feature flag initialization logic
- Simplify analytics session tracker to always use GUTENBERG_KIT
- Simplify ViewPager logic to always create GutenbergKitEditorFragment
- Remove state saving/restoring of the property
- Simplify menu content info logic
- Remove updateVoiceContentIfNeeded method (had early return for GutenbergKit)
- Add TODOs for unused code that can be cleaned up in follow-up commits

* Remove unused createGutenbergEditorFragment method from GutenbergKitActivity

The createGutenbergEditorFragment method is no longer used since we always
create GutenbergKitEditorFragment. This removes the unused method and its
associated TODO comment.

Changes:
- Remove createGutenbergEditorFragment method entirely

* Remove showGutenbergEditor property from GutenbergKitActivity

Since GutenbergKitActivity is only used when the block editor should be active,
the showGutenbergEditor flag is redundant and can be treated as always true.

Changes:
- Remove showGutenbergEditor property declaration
- Remove setShowGutenbergEditor method
- Remove state saving/restoring of the property
- Simplify media selection logic (always use Gutenberg behavior)
- Always apply Gutenberg content migration
- Remove redundant upload progress check (condition was always false)
- Simplify GutenbergKit editor setup check
- Remove unused regular Gutenberg editor setup method
- Add TODOs for further simplification opportunities

* Remove showAztecEditor property from GutenbergKitActivity

Since GutenbergKitActivity never uses the Aztec editor, the showAztecEditor
flag is redundant and can be treated as always false.

Changes:
- Remove showAztecEditor property declaration
- Remove Aztec editor preference check
- Hardcode showAztecEditor=false in EditorPhotoPicker initialization
- Remove Aztec formatting bar overlay margin logic
- Hardcode showAztecEditor=false in media deletion handling
- Remove unused Aztec editor setup method and call

* Remove AztecEditorFragment-related code from GutenbergKitActivity

Since GutenbergKitActivity only supports GutenbergKit editor and will never
use Aztec editor, all Aztec-related code can be removed.

Changes:
- Remove Aztec-related imports (AztecEditorFragment, EditorMediaUtils, etc.)
- Remove aztecImageLoader property and cleanup logic
- Remove Aztec media reattachment and upload recovery methods
- Remove Aztec editor setup and configuration (image/video loaders, exception handling)
- Remove Aztec-specific conditional branches in photo picker and HTML mode
- Convert Aztec-only methods to no-ops (handleMediaSettings, onUndoMediaCheck)
- Remove Aztec focus handling and media mode toggling

* Remove GutenbergEditorFragment-related code from GutenbergKitActivity

Since GutenbergKitActivity only supports GutenbergKit editor and will never
use regular Gutenberg editor, all GutenbergEditorFragment-related code can be removed.

Changes:
- Remove GutenbergEditorFragment and related imports (GutenbergPropsBuilder, etc.)
- Remove massive gutenbergPropsBuilder property and all its logic
- Remove Gutenberg-specific conditional branches in menu handling
- Remove Gutenberg JSP SSO, theme, and capability update logic
- Remove Gutenberg-specific featured image, help, and undo/redo handling
- Remove insert media dialog and gallery creation methods
- Remove editor theme refresh and clear featured image methods
- Convert Gutenberg-only methods to no-ops with explanatory comments
- Add MEDIA_ID_NO_FEATURED_IMAGE_SET constant to replace removed reference
- Simplify content and title initialization logic

* Change editorFragment type from EditorFragmentAbstract? to GutenbergKitEditorFragment?

Since GutenbergKitActivity only uses GutenbergKit editor, the editorFragment
property can be specifically typed, eliminating the need for type checks and casts.

Changes:
- Change editorFragment property type to GutenbergKitEditorFragment?
- Remove all type checks (is GutenbergKitEditorFragment) throughout the code
- Remove unnecessary casts (as GutenbergKitEditorFragment)
- Simplify menu handling (HTML mode, undo/redo) with direct calls
- Simplify analytics tracking (always GUTENBERG_KIT)
- Simplify editor initialization and settings calls
- Fix appendMediaFiles type mismatch with .toMutableMap()
- Remove redundant EditorMediaUploadListener type check
- Add helpful TODOs for potential future cleanup

* Clean up menu handling and remove misleading TODO comments

Improve documentation and simplify menu item hiding logic:

- Remove "TODO: Unreachable?" comment from updateFromEditor method
  (Verified with breakpoints that method is actually reachable; AS false positive)
- Add comprehensive comment explaining shared menu with EditPostActivity
- Simplify menu item hiding logic with clear explanations
- Remove unused variable switchToGutenbergVisibility
- Remove dead code for help menu title logic (always hidden anyway)
- Document why items are hidden rather than menu being duplicated

This maintains current functionality while improving code clarity and
removing confusing TODO comments that suggested incorrect assumptions.

* Remove unnecessary clearFeaturedImage observer

GutenbergKit editor doesn't need the clearFeaturedImage observer since
it handles featured image clearing differently than the regular Gutenberg
editor. This removes 5 lines of unused observer setup.
