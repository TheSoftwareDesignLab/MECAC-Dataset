Add: Store function for the new text-completion endpoint including usage of token.

This adds logic to:
- save token to preference
- use saved token if exists, and if this token causes AUTH_ERROR (meaning it has expires), then fetch token once more and re-try.

Also refactors the parameter ordering o `fetchJetpackAITextCompletion` to put token first as it doesn't work without it.
