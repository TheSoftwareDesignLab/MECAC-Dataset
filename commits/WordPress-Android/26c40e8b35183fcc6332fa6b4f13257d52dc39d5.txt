Analysis: Remove unnecessary duplicate v27 theme login flow config

Since this 0c0ba6c1f6bd9c5175e1b2101feca211812398c1 change resolved the
obsolete sdk int lint warning for res values v23, this
'android:statusBarColor' and 'android:windowLightStatusBar' became the
default. As such, those can be now removed from teh v27 configuration.
