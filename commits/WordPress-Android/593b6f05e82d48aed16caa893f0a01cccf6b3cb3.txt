Feature: Connect activity log detail restore flow with activity log

This commit will make sure to forward the activity result from the
restore flow to the activity log through the activity log detail screen.

And, on the activity log screen the restore feature flag will
differentiate between the corresponding navigation flows, the old and
the new one.
