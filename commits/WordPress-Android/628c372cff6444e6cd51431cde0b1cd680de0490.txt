Remove the `en-gb => en-US` hack for WP metadata

And instead just copy the files from the `WordPress/*metadata/*` source dir to `fastlane/*metadata/android/en-US` dir instead of relying on the odd and buggy `source_locale` parameter of `gp_downloadmetadata`

This is to address the recurring issue we've been encountering with English release notes failing to be generated in `fastlane/metadata` when there were no `en-GB` translation for it in GlotPress (and thus the export for it was empty)
