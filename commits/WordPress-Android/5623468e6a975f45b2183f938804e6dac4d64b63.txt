Adding @aagam94's post excerpt patch with a few tweaks:

 * Modified existing post constructor instead of creating another one.
 * Used 'Excerpt' instead of 'Post excerpt' string to match up with core editor.
 * Tweaked the layout margins a bit.
 * Hid the excerpt field if the user is editing a Page.
