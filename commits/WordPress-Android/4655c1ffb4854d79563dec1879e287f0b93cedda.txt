Refactor: Fix string escape utils import

This import was pointing to 'org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils'
while all other 21 such imports was pointing to
'org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils' instead. As such, this one
import is updated to match the general pattern for using the
'StringEscapeUtils' utility.
