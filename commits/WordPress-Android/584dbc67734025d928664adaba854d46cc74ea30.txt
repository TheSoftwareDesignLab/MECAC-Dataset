Base the max image width on the smallest dimension of the fragment's view.

Fixes issue where image could be too large if you rotated from landscape to portrait in the post view.

Also added AsyncTasks for loading local post content in EditPostContentFragment as well as EditPostPreviewFragment as they were blocking the UI thread.
