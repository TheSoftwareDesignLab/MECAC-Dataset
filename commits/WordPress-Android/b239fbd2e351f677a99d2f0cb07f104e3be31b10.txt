move date formatting to a Domain <-> UI model mapper

Move the date formatting that was happening in the UI / View layer of the Prompt
List Item to a Mapper and do it in the presentation (VM) layer. This makes the
UseCase more reusable by using a Domain model (from FluxC) and removes the date
formatting objects from Compose UI.
