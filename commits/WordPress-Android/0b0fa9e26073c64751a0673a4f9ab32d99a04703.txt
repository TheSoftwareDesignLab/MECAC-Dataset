Save and retrieve top bar state in SavedInstanceState bundle

Save information about the selected feed id and top bar filter ui state in the
SavedInstanceState Bundle and recover it when the activity is destroyed due to
system-initiated destruction (low-memory or "Don't keep activities"	dev setting)
to keep the experience consistent.
