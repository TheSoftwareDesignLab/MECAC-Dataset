Feature: Add negative action on quick start notice

There's no negative button on the snackbar, negative action is triggered only when dismiss swipe event (DISMISS_EVENT_SWIPE) is detected which means user has explicitly dismissed the notice.

Negative action is not triggered on other dismiss events:
1. DISMISS_EVENT_ACTION (Indicates that the Snackbar was dismissed via an action click.)
2. DISMISS_EVENT_TIMEOUT (Indicates that the Snackbar was dismissed via a timeout.)
3. DISMISS_EVENT_MANUAL (Indicates that the Snackbar was dismissed via a call to dismiss()).
4. DISMISS_EVENT_CONSECUTIVE (Indicates that the Snackbar was dismissed from a new Snackbar being shown.)
