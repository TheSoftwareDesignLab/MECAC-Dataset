Giphy: Show Toast on endless scroll API errors

Added `Event` class from this
[Android Developers article](https://goo.gl/qZLG8Y) to show a Toast
only once even after configuration changes. We cannot use
`SingleLiveEvent` because that has not effect when it is transformed
through `Transformations.switchMap`.
