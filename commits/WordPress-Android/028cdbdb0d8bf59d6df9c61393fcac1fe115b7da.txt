Analysis: Suppress animation set start and recycle related lint warnings

Warning Message: "This declaration is opt-in and its usage should be
marked with @kotlinx.coroutines.DelicateCoroutinesApi or
@OptIn(markerClass = kotlinx.coroutines.DelicateCoroutinesApi.class)"

Explanation: "This API has been flagged as opt-in with warning-level
severity.

Any declaration annotated with this marker is considered part of an
unstable or otherwise non-standard API surface and its call sites should
accept the opt-in aspect of it by using the '@OptIn' annotation, using
the marker annotation -- effectively causing further propagation of the
opt-in aspect -- or configuring the 'UnsafeOptInUsageWarning' check's
options for project-wide opt-in."
