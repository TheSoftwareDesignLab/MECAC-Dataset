Merge release/25.6 into trunk (#21622)

* Make DomainItem focusable

* fix: Support experimental features in production builds

Utilizing the existing `FeatureConfig` implementation meant the
experimental features were always disabled in production builds,
regardless if a user manually enabled the associated toggle. This
occurred because `FeatureConfig` ignores manual overrides in production,
instead respecting the build or remote configuration.

The new experimental feature implementation relies solely on `AppPrefs`
for experimental features, allowing toggling their active state in all
build types. The new implementation does not support build- or
remote-controlled configuration.
