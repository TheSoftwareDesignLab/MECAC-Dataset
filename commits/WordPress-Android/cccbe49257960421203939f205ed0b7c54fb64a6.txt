Analysis: Suppress all photo picker related test deprecated warnings

Warning Messages:
- "'PhotoPickerViewModel' is deprecated. This class is being refactored,
if you implement any change, please also update
{@link org.wordpress.android.ui.mediapicker.MediaPickerViewModel}"
- "'DeviceMediaListBuilder' is deprecated. This class is being
refactored, if you implement any change, please also update
{@link org.wordpress.android.ui.mediapicker.loader.DeviceListBuilder}"
- "'PhotoPickerItem' is deprecated. This class is being refactored, if
you implement any change, please also update
{@link org.wordpress.android.ui.mediapicker.MediaItem}"
- "'PhotoPickerUiItem' is deprecated. This class is being refactored, if
you implement any change, please also update
{@link org.wordpress.android.ui.mediapicker.MedaPickerUiItem}"

These deprecated warnings are suppressed, that is, instead of being
resolved, since a resolution would require a proper migration.

Also, as part of this commit, a few other minor warnings, including
imports, got resolved too.

Example Explanation: See KDoc on 'PhotoPickerViewModel' class.
