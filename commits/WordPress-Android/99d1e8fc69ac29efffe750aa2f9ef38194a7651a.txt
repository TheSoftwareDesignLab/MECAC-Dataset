These deprecated warnings are suppressed, that is, instead of being
resolved, since a resolution would require a proper migration.

You will also notice that I optimized the deprecated imports and
suppress the deprecation closer to source wherever possible, that is,
instead on suppressing it on the file level. Thus, in this change you
will also notice some refactoring related to optimizing the imports.
Only the 'EditorPhotoPicker' related deprecation got suppressed both, on
the file level and closer to the deprecation itself.

Example Explanation: See KDoc on 'PhotoPickerFragment' class.
