Remove add window inset to fragment container logic after revised keyboard height calculation in the previous commit

Checking results on different emulators (gesture/ 3-button-navigation):

Pixel 2: 1080 x 1920
Pixel 3 XL: 1440 x 2960
Pixel 5: 1080 X 2340

this logic doesn't seem to be necessary now.
