Test: Force strictly androidx test espresso version (aka 3.4.0)

This is a temporal test configuration to see if connected tests will
stop timing-out after 15' minutes of run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is temporal test configuration is applied because running the below
Gradle 'dependencies' command did show that the 'Espresso' dependency is
now being transitively updated to '3.5.0' (from '3.4.0'), which is known
to add significant delays to our UI tests, that is, as seen from testing
such an update via its dedicated dependency update PR (see below):
