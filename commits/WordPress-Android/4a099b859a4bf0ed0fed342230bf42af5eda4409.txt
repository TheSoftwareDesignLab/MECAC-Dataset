Deps: Remove support annotation exclusion from zendesk dependency

This 'exclude' related configuration was added due to 'Jetifier' related
requirements (076817a82f3144adb62deaa2850b01f41640bb66).

However, and as part of 'Zendesk' version '5.0.9', an migration to
AndroidX occurred, which refactored the internal Suas library that was
adding this 'support-annotations' dependency, but no longer does.

As such, this 'exclude' related configuration is no longer necessary and
can be safely removed.
