Post editor updates:

 * Holo style and uses default text/button styles.
 * Formatting toolbar fades in and out based on whether the content EditText has focus.
 * Post content EditText now expands in the scrollview as you add more content.
 * Added integers.xml so that we can change int values based on device size/pixel density.
 * More compact, makes better use of placeholders and only showing content that is relevant in the post editor (for example, selected categories textview is hidden until you add categories or are editing a post that already has categories selected).
 * Removed separate edit.xml copies that we were using for tablet layouts. A bit more work can be done to get the editor looking nice on tablets.
 * Moved save/publish button to the action bar. Added a preview icon that doesn't have an action yet, but @koke is adding that soon :)
