Merge 25.6 release notes to trunk (#21601)

* Make DomainItem focusable

* fix: Support experimental features in production builds

Utilizing the existing `FeatureConfig` implementation meant the
experimental features were always disabled in production builds,
regardless if a user manually enabled the associated toggle. This
occurred because `FeatureConfig` ignores manual overrides in production,
instead respecting the build or remote configuration.

The new experimental feature implementation relies solely on `AppPrefs`
for experimental features, allowing toggling their active state in all
build types. The new implementation does not support build- or
remote-controlled configuration.

* Merge release_notes/25.6 into release/25.6 (#21600)

* Add editorialized release notes for version

* Update WordPress `PlayStoreStrings.po` for version 25.6

* Update Jetpack `PlayStoreStrings.po` for version 25.6
