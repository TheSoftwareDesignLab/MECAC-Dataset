Tests: Fix login with WP.com in Jetpack app

I had to add instrumented test files for JP and WP build variants to successfully build ui tests for both apps. The requirement is caused by the string resource unique to the jetpack variant in the `LoginPrologueRevampedFragment`: `R.string.continue_with_wpcom_no_signup`.
See https://developer.android.com/studio/test/advanced-test-setup

This change affects UI tests in:
- BlockEditorTests
- ReaderTests
- StatsTests
- JPScreenshotTest
- WPScreenshotTest
