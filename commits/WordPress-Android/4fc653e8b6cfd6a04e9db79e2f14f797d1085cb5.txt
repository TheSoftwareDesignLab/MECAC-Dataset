Analysis: Resolve unnecessary abstract class warning for fluxc dao

Description: "This rule inspects 'abstract' classes. In case an
'abstract class' does not have any concrete members it should be
refactored into an interface. Abstract classes which do not define any
'abstract' members should instead be refactored into concrete classes."
