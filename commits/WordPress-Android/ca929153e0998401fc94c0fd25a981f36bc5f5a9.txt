Focus opens virt keyb for SuggestionAutoCompleteText

SuggestionAutoCompleteText now:
* receives focus only by clicking on it (performClick())
* when focused, it haves the virtual keyboard also be opened (unless a hardware keyboard is present)
* when virtual keyboard closes, the editbox loses focus. In essense, editbox focus and virtual keyboard are now linked.
* on rotate, the focus state (and thus the virtual keyboard state) is retained
