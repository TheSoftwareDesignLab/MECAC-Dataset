* Updated post list row layout (also renamed layout file).
 * Display local drafts, drafts and locally changed posts with an orange status label in the posts list.
 * Added support for 'Scheduled' post status to be displayed.
 * When loading more posts with infinite scroll, only load the amount requested from the end of the result array. (switching to wp.getPosts someday wouldn't require this)
 * Don't override locally changes posts when loading more, in case a user modified a post at the end of the list and the next call reaches the end of all posts on the blog.
