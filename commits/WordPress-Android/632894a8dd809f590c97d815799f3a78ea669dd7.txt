Refactor: Merge show quick start dialog old/new site navigation actions

This refactor is a further improvement on making this
'ShowQuickStartDialog' site navigation action more testable by moving
the string logic to the view model. And as much, this make the need for
two separate 'ShowQuickStartDialog' site navigation actions, the old and
new one obsolete.
