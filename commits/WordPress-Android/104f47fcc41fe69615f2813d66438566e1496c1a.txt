Disabled hint announcements and applied accessibility headings 

The content of the hint announcement and the text of the TextViews are the same so the announcement is duplicated so the hint is disabled in favor of the text since it will be updated and truly reflect the state of the targeted setting. 

The headers are now marked as accessibility headers for easier header navigation.
