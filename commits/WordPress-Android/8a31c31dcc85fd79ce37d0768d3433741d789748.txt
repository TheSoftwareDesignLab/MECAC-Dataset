Move fragment initialization logic from GutenbergKitActivity to fragment (#22171)

This refactoring moves fragment-specific initialization logic from the activity to the fragment itself, improving separation of concerns and reducing the activity's responsibilities.

Changes:
- Move listener setup from `initializeEditorFragment()` in activity to `initializeFragmentListeners()` in fragment
- Remove `EditorFragmentActivity` interface dependency from activity
- Add new callback methods to `EditorFragmentListener` interface for fragment-to-activity communication
- Fragment now handles its own initialization instead of relying on activity
- Reduce GutenbergKitActivity line count by removing fragment-specific logic
- Prepare foundation for future ViewModel migration by containing fragment logic

This change maintains the same functionality while improving code organization and making the fragment more self-contained.
