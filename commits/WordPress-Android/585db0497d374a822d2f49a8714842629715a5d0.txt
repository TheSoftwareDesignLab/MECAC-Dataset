Improve editor selection logic and add detailed logging in EditorLauncher (#22151)

* Integrate PostUtils.shouldShowGutenbergEditor logic in EditorLauncher

Add support for content-aware editor selection by implementing the same
logic used in EditPostActivity.setShowGutenbergEditor within EditorLauncher.

Changes:
- Add SiteStore and PostStore injection to EditorLauncher
- Create getSite() helper in EditorLauncherSiteSource for site resolution
- Implement post fetching logic using postLocalId parameter
- Integrate PostUtils.shouldShowGutenbergEditor check in editor selection

* Add detailed logging to EditorLauncher.shouldUseGutenbergKitEditor

Enhanced the editor selection logic with comprehensive AppLog statements
that explain in spoken language why GutenbergKit editor is or isn't used.

Changes:
- Add communicative logging for all decision paths in shouldUseGutenbergKitEditor
- Include detailed context about feature flags, post content, and site settings
- Use AppLog.T.EDITOR for proper log categorization
- Provide debugging information suitable for analytics integration

* Fix Detekt violations in EditorLauncher.shouldUseGutenbergKitEditor

Refactored the method to address code quality issues by:
- Extracting logging logic into separate helper methods to reduce method length and complexity
- Breaking long lines to comply with MaxLineLength rule
- Using single return point to satisfy ReturnCount rule

Changes:
- Extract logFeatureDisabledReason() helper method
- Extract logNoSiteInfoReason() helper method
- Extract determineEditorForSite() helper method
- Extract logEditorDecision() helper method
- Maintain same logging functionality with improved code structure

* Fix PostModel property reference in logging

Changed post.localId to post.remotePostId to use correct PostModel properties.
The localId property doesn't exist - post.id is the local ID and post.remotePostId
is the remote ID.

Changes:
- Replace post.localId with post.remotePostId in log message
- Update log message to clarify local vs remote ID distinction

* Refactor logEditorDecision to eliminate duplicated calculations

Extracted repeated method calls to improve code efficiency and readability.

Changes:
- Extract PostUtils.contentContainsGutenbergBlocks() to hasGutenbergBlocks variable
- Extract SiteUtils.isBlockEditorDefaultForNewPost() to isBlockEditorDefaultForNewPosts variable
- Unify log message format with single AppLog.d call and dynamic action text
- Simplify conditional logic for determining reason

* Fix double getSite() calls and remove unsafe !! operator

Store getSite() result in variable to avoid duplicate database queries
and eliminate potential KotlinNullPointerException from !! operator.

Changes:
- Extract site = params.siteSource.getSite(siteStore) before when expression
- Use stored site variable in null check and else branch
- Remove unsafe !! operator since site is now guaranteed non-null in else branch

* Extract duplicated feature flags logging into helper method

Eliminate code duplication by creating getFeatureFlagsString() helper method
for consistent feature flag logging across different scenarios.

Changes:
- Add getFeatureFlagsString() helper with includeDisableExperimentalBlockEditor parameter
- Replace duplicated feature flag string building in logFeatureDisabledReason()
- Replace duplicated feature flag string building in logNoSiteInfoReason()
- Maintain same logging output format while reducing code duplication

* Simplify EditorLauncher.getFeatureFlagsString

* Clarify logging to emphasize feature flag precedence

Update log messages to make it clear that GutenbergKit feature being enabled
is the primary requirement, and post content/site settings are secondary
conditions that determine editor choice within the enabled feature.

Changes:
- Prefix all logEditorDecision reasons with "GutenbergKit feature is enabled"
- Distinguish between "and" (positive conditions) vs "but" (limiting conditions)
- Remove misleading implications that post content alone determines editor choice
