improve Prompts List item accessibility semantics

Merge list item descendants to treat the content as one instead of each text
being selected by the screen reader (makes the behavior similar to ListItem
material composable).

Also clears semantics from the subtitle divider, which should not be read by the
screen reader and was being read as "bullet".
