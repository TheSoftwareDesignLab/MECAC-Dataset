Fix Button Layout Overflow (#21137)

>Issue: The button "THE VERSION FROM ANOTHER DEVICE" was not fitting within its allocated space and was spilling over into a second line, leading to a cluttered UI.

>Solution: Added the android:layout_weight="1" property to the button's style, which ensures that the button receives equal space alongside other buttons, preventing it from breaking into multiple lines.

>Result: The button now fits within the available width and maintains a consistent, clean appearance on different screen sizes, enhancing the overall user interface.
