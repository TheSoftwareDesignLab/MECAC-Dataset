Rename `EditPostActivity` types for `GutenbergKitActivity` preparation (#22121)

* Rename EditPostActivityConstants to EditorConstants

Prepare for GutenbergKitActivity duplication by making constants
shareable between editor activities. This rename eliminates the
EditPostActivity-specific naming from shared constants that will
be used by both EditPostActivity and the future GutenbergKitActivity.

Changes:
- Rename EditPostActivityConstants.kt to EditorConstants.kt
- Update all imports and references across the codebase
- No functional changes, only renaming for better code organization

* Rename EditPostActivityHook to EditorDataProvider

Prepare interface for sharing between EditPostActivity and future
GutenbergKitActivity by using a more generic name. This interface
provides data access to editor fragments and will be implemented
by both editor activities.

Changes:
- Rename interface from EditPostActivityHook to EditorDataProvider
- Update all method names and variable references
- Update detekt baseline with new exception message text
- No functional changes, only renaming for better code organization

This eliminates EditPostActivity-specific naming from shared interface
that will be used by both editing activities.
