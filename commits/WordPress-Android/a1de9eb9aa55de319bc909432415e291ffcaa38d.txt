Analysis: Suppress progress dialog deprecated warnings

Warning Messages:
- "'ProgressDialog' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java"
- "'constructor ProgressDialog(Context!)' is deprecated.
Deprecated in Java"
- "'show(Context!, CharSequence!, CharSequence!, Boolean):
ProgressDialog!' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java"
- "'show(Context!, CharSequence!, CharSequence!, Boolean, Boolean):
ProgressDialog!' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java"
- "'setter for isIndeterminate: Boolean' is deprecated.
Deprecated in Java"
- "'setMessage(CharSequence!): Unit' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java"

These deprecated warnings are suppressed, that is, instead of being
resolved, since a resolution would require a proper migration.

You will also notice that I suppressed the deprecated warning both, on
the file level and closer to the deprecation itself. In addition to
that, you will notice that I suppressed the deprecated warning for other
such warnings, like 'StringEscapeUtils' and 'PhotoPickerActivity'. I did
that because suppressing on the file level was necessary due to the
'android.app.ProgressDialog' import that can't be suppressed any other
way. But, when doing so, every deprecated warning is suppressed as well.
At which point the deprecated information is lost. This way, adding
first the '@Suppress("DEPRECATION")' closer to source and then adding it
on the file level makes sure that this information is not lost, at least
for the existing code.

Explanation: "This class was deprecated in API level 26. ProgressDialog
is a modal dialog, which prevents the user from interacting with the
app. Instead of using this class, you should use a progress indicator
like ProgressBar, which can be embedded in your app's UI. Alternatively,
you can use a notification to inform the user of the task's progress."
