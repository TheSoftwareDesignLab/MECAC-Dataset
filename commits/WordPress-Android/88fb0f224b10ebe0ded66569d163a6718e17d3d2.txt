Initial commit of ActionBarSherlock conversion. Note:

 * It's ugly at the moment :)
 * Lots of bugs to still sort out with the change of the WPTitleBar to ActionBar
 * You must have ActionBarSherlock downloaded and added to Eclipse as a Library project. Details: http://actionbarsherlock.com/usage.html
 * Started experimenting with UI tweaks to fit in with Holo better: Square gravatars, more padding in lists with no gradient backgrounds
 * Added support for the action bar icons to Posts, Comments and Reader views.
