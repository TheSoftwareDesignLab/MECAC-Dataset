Enable UI tests on Gutenberg releases

This enables automatic execution of our optional UI test suite on PRs used for Gutenberg Mobile releases. Releases will now benefit from optional tests being ran by default, without release wranglers needing to manually run them.

The regex used here matches the branch name used by the release automation script [here](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/release-toolkit-gutenberg-mobile/blob/6595c075e00aff342164b469dcfbaf84e4bda561/release_automation.sh#L262).

This is a follow up to https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/pull/16233 which made the same changes for WPiOS.
