Deps: Use androidx legacy version for both support core ui and v4

There is no reason for the 'androidXLegacyVersion' to be split into two
separate versions as both are pointing to the same 'Legacy' release.
Actually this can end up creating problems if one dependency is updated
and not the other.

As such, this commit merges them into one version.
