Analysis: Add missing n-a to comment jetpack theme response fields

FYI: 'n-a' stands for 'nullability annotations'.

PS: This 'NotNullFieldNotInitialized' warning got suppressed because a
'response' class can never have its fields initialized via a constructor
initialization, or otherwise for that matter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, you will note that the 'author', 'author_uri', 'theme_uri' and
'version' fields are being defined as non-null. If you compare them
fields on the 'WordPress' equivalent response, you will notice them
being nullable there. My testing revealed that this is indeed the case
with Jetpack themes and thus those were marked as non-null here.
