Handle the nullability of theme lists in ThemeBrowserFragment

"fetchThemes()" can't return null because adapter.setThemeList() doesn't accept null list. "sortedWpComThemes" and "sortedJetpackThemes" can't be null because they're being returned in "fetchThemes()". "wpComThemes" can't be null because it's returned from "sortedWpComThemes". "uploadedThemes" can be null because it's being used in sortedJetpackThemes and sortedJetpackThemes can still return a value event though "uploadedThemes" is null.
