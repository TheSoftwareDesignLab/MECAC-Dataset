Analysis: Resolve implicit default locale warning for site store

Description: "Prefer passing [java.util.Locale] explicitly than using
implicit default value when formatting strings or performing a case
conversion.

The default locale is almost always inappropriate for machine-readable
text like HTTP headers. For example, if locale with tag
'ar-SA-u-nu-arab' is a current default then '%d' placeholders will be
evaluated to a number consisting of Eastern-Arabic (non-ASCII) digits.
[java.util.Locale.US] is recommended for machine-readable output."

PS: And with that commit, there are no more Detekt related baseline
warnings corresponding to the 'fluxc' module, thus the '<!-- fluxc -->'
section is removed as it is no longer necessary.
