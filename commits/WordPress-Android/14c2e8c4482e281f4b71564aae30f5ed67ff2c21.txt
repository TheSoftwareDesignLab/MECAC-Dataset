Fix `RecyclerView` Position Handling in ReaderCommentAdapter (#22048)

* Fix RecyclerView position handling in ReaderCommentAdapter

Resolves the "Do not treat position as fixed" lint warning by properly handling adapter positions in onBindViewHolder() and all click listeners.

Changes:
- Use holder.getBindingAdapterPosition() instead of position parameter for initial data access
- Update all click listeners to get fresh position data instead of capturing stale comment objects
- Add proper RecyclerView.NO_POSITION validation throughout
- Use unique variable names to avoid conflicts (authorCurrentPosition, replyCurrentPosition, etc.)

This ensures that comment interactions work correctly even when RecyclerView data changes during the view binding lifecycle.

* Improve author click listener logic in ReaderCommentAdapter

- Always attach author click listener instead of conditionally based on bind-time data
- Move hasAuthorBlogId() check to tap time with fresh comment data
- Remove duplicate setOnClickListener call
- Ensure consistent pattern with other click handlers that validate data at tap time

This is more robust since RecyclerView can recycle views and comment data may change between bind time and tap time.
