Update `available_langauges.xml`

 - Ran `fastlane download_translations`
 - Then amended the commits that were done, to discard any updates to the `strings.xml` files (we don't want to pick any new string and translation outside of the regular code-freeze / release cycle), and only keep the changes to the `available_languages.xml` files that the tooling did.
