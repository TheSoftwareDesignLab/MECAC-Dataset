Deps: Update apache commons text to 1.10.0

This mainly fixes the possible 'StringSubstitutor' related vulnerability
in Apache's 'Commons Text' library.

For more details see: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/
changes-report.html#a1.10.0

And more specifically see release notes entry below:

"Make default string lookups configurable via system property. Remove
dns, url, and script lookups from defaults. If these lookups are
required for use in StringSubstitutor.createInterpolator(), they must be
enabled via system property. See StringLookupFactory for details."
