Introduce mutable tabs ui state live data

Since state (MySiteUiState) livedata is immutable, results from mutable tabs ui state livedata are merged with it and combined results are mapped to update tab ui state in the UiModel.

It will be useful when we need to update tab ui state to show QS focus point in a future PR.
