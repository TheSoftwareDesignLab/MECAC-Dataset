Replace `PrepublishingBottomSheetListener` with `ViewModel` Communication (#22084)

* Replace PrepublishingBottomSheetListener with ViewModel communication

This change eliminates the PrepublishingBottomSheetListener interface dependency
to prepare EditPostActivity for Navigation Component migration by replacing
callback-based communication with proper ViewModel patterns.

Problem: PrepublishingBottomSheetFragment used interface callbacks to communicate
with EditPostActivity, preventing Navigation Component adoption. The fragment also
used fragment-scoped ViewModels, causing separate instances and broken communication.

Solution: Replace interface communication with activity-scoped PrepublishingViewModel
that both the activity and fragment share, enabling proper event-based communication.

Changes:
- Remove PrepublishingBottomSheetListener interface implementation from EditPostActivity
- Add PrepublishingViewModel to EditPostActivity.initializeViewModels() with activity scope
- Update PrepublishingBottomSheetFragment to use requireActivity() scope for ViewModel
- Replace interface callback with ViewModel.triggerOnSubmitButtonClickedListener observation
- Fix all prepublishing child fragments to use activity-scoped parent ViewModel
- Replace generic isStarted flag with semantic tagsFetched flag in PrepublishingViewModel
- Improve start() method logic to handle both configuration changes and fragment recreation
- Ensure dismissal + reopen resets to HOME screen while config changes preserve current screen

Technical Details:
- Activity and fragment now share same ViewModel instance via ViewModelProvider(requireActivity())
- Event-based communication replaces direct interface calls
- Proper state management handles fragment lifecycle and configuration changes
