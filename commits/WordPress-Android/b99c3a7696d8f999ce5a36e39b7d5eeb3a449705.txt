fix #549: add option to remember last share selection

* add checkbox in share view to remember last share selection.
* this checkbox saves state differently for text shares and image shares.
* add a "reset auto-sharing settings" in preference view.
* if the select blog id doesn't exist anymore (or is hidden), auto-sharing settings will be reset, the user notified by a toast message.
