Analysis: Resolve deprecated coroutines thread module scope warnings

Warning Messages: "'UI/DEFAULT_SCOPE: String' is deprecated. Implement
CoroutineScope interface and cancel all child coroutines in
onCleared/onDestroy/.."ª

It seems that both, the deprecated named 'UI_SCOPE' and 'DEFAULT_SCOPE'
coroutine scopes, that are being provided by the [ThreadModule] module,
are no longer being utilized within this codebase and thus, they can be
now safely removed. There was no need for any migration either.
