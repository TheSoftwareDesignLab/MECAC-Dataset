Tests: Fixed tests after MySiteImprovementsFeatureConfig is removed

Active quick start task should be PUBLISH_POST so that it can be completed on `MainActionListItem.ActionType.CREATE_NEW_POST` action (via create new page/post/story bottom sheet).

See WPMainActivityViewModel.onFabClicked:
```
_showQuickStarInBottomSheet.postValue(quickStartRepository.activeTask.value == PUBLISH_POST)
```

and

WPMainActivityViewModel.onCreateActionClicked

```
_showQuickStarInBottomSheet.value?.let { showQuickStart ->
    if (showQuickStart) {
       if (actionType == CREATE_NEW_POST) quickStartRepository.completeTask(PUBLISH_POST)
       _showQuickStarInBottomSheet.postValue(false)
    }
}
```

This is why added activeTask.value = PUBLISH_POST before calling onFabClicked.

Also, below test mentions "completes task" but verifies that `quickStartRepository.completeTask` is never invoked. Fixed the test to verify that `quickStartRepository.completeTask` is actually invoked.
```
CREATE_NEW_POST action in bottom sheet with active Quick Start completes task and hides the focus point
```

Earlier the tests passed as we always passed `shouldShowQuickStartFocusPoint` = true in tests. This variable was set from the activity when deprecated MySiteFragment existed, but is not  available any more and tests are adjusted to work with `ImprovedMySiteFragment`.
