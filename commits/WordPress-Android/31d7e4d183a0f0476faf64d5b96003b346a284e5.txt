Split `GiphyMediaViewModel` into an interface (immutable) and a mutable class

The `MutableGiphyMediaViewModel` will be used by `GiphyPickerViewModel` to modify the new `isSelected` and `selectionNumber` properties. These properties will be observed by the `GiphyMediaViewHolder` but it should never be able to modify them.
