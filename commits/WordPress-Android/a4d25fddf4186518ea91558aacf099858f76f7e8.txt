Analysis: Suppress complex method warning for fluxc module

Description: "Complex methods are hard to understand and read. It might
not be obvious what side-effects a complex method has. Prefer splitting
up complex methods into smaller methods that are in turn easier to
understand. Smaller methods can also be named much clearer which leads
to improved readability of the code.

This rule uses McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity (MCC) metric to measure
the number of linearly independent paths through a function's source
code (https://www.ndepend.com/docs/code-metrics#CC). The higher the
number of independent paths, the more complex a method is. Complex
methods use too many of the following statements. Each one of them adds
one to the complexity count."
