Exit UI and update editor with space keystroke

With this commit, an empty space is passed to the "finishWithValue()" function when a user presses space key immediately when the suggestions UI opens.

"finishWithValue()" serves to exit the UI and update the editor with the updated value (in our case, an empty space key).
