Analysis: Suppress fragment pager adapter deprecated warnings

Warning Message: "'FragmentPagerAdapter' is deprecated.
Deprecated in Java"

These deprecated warnings are suppressed, that is, instead of being
resolved, since a resolution would require a proper migration.

You will also notice that I didn't suppressed the deprecated warning
both, on the file level and closer to the deprecation itself. I will be
doing the file level suppression on the 'ProgressDialog', which is yet
to be suppressed.

Explanation:
- "Use FragmentPagerAdapter(FragmentManager, int) with
BEHAVIOR_RESUME_ONLY_CURRENT_FRAGMENT"
- This class is deprecated. Switch to
androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2 and use
androidx.viewpager2.adapter.FragmentStateAdapter instead.
