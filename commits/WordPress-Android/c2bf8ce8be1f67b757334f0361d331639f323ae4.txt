Manually copy en-US's `changelog` from `WordPress/metadata`

Because of a bug in our tooling, the `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/1281.txt` file was not generated by `gp_downloadmetadata` because GlotPress didn't have a translation for `en-GB` locale for it (and in `gp_downloadmetadata`, we extract the original `en-US` from the export of `en-GB`... but if that entry is non-existant to begin with, that hack fails anyway).

See pdnsEh-jJ-p2 for details of this tooling bug

Thanks @ParaskP7 for noticing the missing changelog in the PR in the first place in https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/pull/17340#issuecomment-1279047088 !!
