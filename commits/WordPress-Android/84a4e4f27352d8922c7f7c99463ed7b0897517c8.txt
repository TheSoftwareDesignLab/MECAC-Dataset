Change coordinator ID in filtered_list_component

This layout is usually inflated in Reader feeds inside the Main Activity of the
app, which already contains a View with the same ID that's used for snackbar
and properly positioning the FAB, which is now visible in Reader.

This was causing a bug where the snackbar was shown behind the bottom bar
instead of pushing the FAB up and being shown between the bottom bar and FAB.
