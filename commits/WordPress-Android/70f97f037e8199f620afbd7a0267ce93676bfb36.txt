Adapt the landing screen animation to use orientation angle

This implements a different approach: updating the velocity value in the
animation directly from the pitch angle of the device. This removes all
inertia from the physics model, which may help to make the interaction
more responsive, given the narrow range of appropriate velocity values
we are constrained to.
