Analysis: Add default and non-default constructors for theme model

This is done so that clients of that model, clients like JP/WPAndroid,
when trying to manually instantiating such a model (if needed), they
will always use the non-default constructor.

The empty default constructor was added because '@Table' related models
need to have one such constructor. Otherwise, its 'Mapper' related
auto-generated class would fail to compile, in this case the
'ThemeModelMapper.java' class.

Also, 2 full-ish-arguments constructor were added, which should be the
preferred and goto constructor for most cases, one for a WP.coma theme,
and one for a Jetpack theme.

FYI: The trick I used to first '@Deprecated' this constructor is to help
clients avoid using this constructor in the future, that is, when they
manually construct one. Suppressing the 'DeprecatedIsStillUsed' warning
was necessary because otherwise, even if every occurrence in the
codebase is being switched to the non-default constructor, the
auto-generated 'Mapper' related class will anyway use that default
constructor, thus this warning will persist no matter what.
