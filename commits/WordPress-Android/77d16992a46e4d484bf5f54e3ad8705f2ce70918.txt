Remove the linting step post translations download

It doesn't make sense to have `android_download_translation` trigger a lint of Jetpack… before we had time to have all the locales (including the fallbacks) in place. So keeping that `lint_task: 'intJetpackVanillaRelease` here would have triggered it too soon.

Also, to be honest I'm not even sure this was ever doing anything, since I'm not sure I ever caught any translation issue via that `lint` task, and I think most L10n warnings are raised during the task assembling the resources rather than the task doing the linting. So overall the action running that lint task took a long time to run on my local Mac while not providing much, making the beta and release processes unnecessarily longer

Finally, even if that might have protected us from any potential localization failure, I always planned to remove the execution of that `lint` task from here since ages, since it makes more sense to let the CI do it, and have the `Release` step of the CI depend on the Build & Lint steps to have passed beforehand.

The only reason why we didn't have that dependency set in the CI so far is because while the Lint step has been migrated into Buildkite, the Release steps are still on CircleCI, so we can't make them depend on one another. But I'm planning to migrate the Release steps from CircleCI to Buildkite very soon, at which point I'll be able to restore the dependency between those steps, making the local execution of the lint task on my local Mac completely obsolete anyway.
