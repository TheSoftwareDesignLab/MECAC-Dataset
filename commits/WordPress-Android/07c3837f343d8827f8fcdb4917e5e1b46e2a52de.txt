Deps: Remove unused androidx legacy support v4 and core ui dependencies

These dependencies were added as part the migration process to
'AndroidX' for this module back in Jun 2019
(b7ac12d358f7238beb0ca48fc56916ff3c6b4128).

The only 'androidx.legacy' usage is located within the
'zs_activity_request_list_scene_empty.xml' layout file and more
specifically on its 2 x 'Widget Space' elements within. This layout
file was copy-pasted for Zendesk purposes back in Dec 2021
(998464e3fed01acc9ba2362d9fcd7bb3507c35fb). But, this 'com.zendesk'
dependency, as well as other dependencies, already contain such
'androidx.legacy' dependencies within. As such, those are anyway
resolved successfully without the need to explicitly declare them.

As such, this leftover from back then can be now safely removed.
