Feature: Extract color control activated color to base colors

Since this 'colorControlActivated' color needs to be updated for the
'Jetpack' app, this commit extracts that to 'colors_base.xml' files and
updates the Jetpack specific light theme 'colorControlActivated' color
from the WordPress hardcoded 'primary_30' value to the Jetpack dynamic
'colorPrimary' color, just like it already happens on the dark them for
both apps.
