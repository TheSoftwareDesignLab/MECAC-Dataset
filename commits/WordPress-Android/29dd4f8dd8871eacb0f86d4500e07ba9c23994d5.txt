Analysis: Move indicator selector resources to wordpress source set

All those 3 indicator selector related resources are used from within
the 'wordpress' flavored 'login_signup_screen.xml' layout file. The same
layout file for the 'jetpack' dimension does not utilise them and as
such those where reported as unused resources.

As such, this commit fixes the 3 'UnusedResources' errors that appear
when running Lint on the 'jetpack' dimension.
