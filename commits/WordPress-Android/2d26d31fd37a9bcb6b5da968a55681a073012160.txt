Fix: Replace material check box with with checkbox on every layout

Replacing the '<com.google.android.material.checkbox.MaterialCheckBox>'
layout element with '<CheckBox>' fixes a breaking change where the
checkbox related UI started misbehaving, that is, in terms of showing
the wrong checkbox colors, on various themes (light/dark) and for
various states (enabled/disable).

For example, while testing on the 'Jetpack' app, using
'MaterialCheckBox' on a layout, which is on dark theme, will shown its
'disabled' state as total black (instead of it having a surrounding
white square), and, its 'enabled' state as total black too (instead of
it being a filled green square with a black tick icon).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am not 100% sure why that happens, and I tried various ways to
overcome this UI related breaking change, including using a
'Widget.App.CheckBox' style via the '?attr/buttonTint' and
''?attr/buttonIconTint' (recommended by docs), that is, since inheriting
the core app's theme (aka 'Base.Wordpress') from 'Theme.Material3.*' is
a bigger undertaking anyway.

This however didn't work, and as such, I tried something else, using
the '<CheckBox>' directly, which is supposed to be auto-inflated as
'<com.google.android.material.button.MaterialCheckBox>' via
'MaterialComponentsViewInflater' when using a 'Theme.Material3.*' theme
(see docs).

I understand that the core app's theme (aka 'Base.Wordpress') is not
using the 'Theme.Material3.*' theme, but instead it is using the
'Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.DarkActionBar.Bridge', but this anyway,
somehow worked. Also, the fact that the 'Checkbox' is already being used
as such on various other layouts (like 'media_settings_activity.xml')
gave me the confidence that this is the correct way forward. Another
benefit of this fix is that the changes are also kept to a minimum.

indeterminate and error states! Check out the updated documentation."
