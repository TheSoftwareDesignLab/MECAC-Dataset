Analysis: Resolve obsolete sdk int lint warning for res values v23

Warning Message: "This folder configuration (v23) is unnecessary;
minSdkVersion is 24. Merge all the resources in this folder into
values."

This 'res/values-v23' folder, its 'themes.xml' file and its
'Theme.LoginFlow' and 'Theme.LoginFlow.TransparentStatusBar' styles can
be moved into and replace the 'Theme.LoginFlow and empty
'Theme.LoginFlow.TransparentStatusBar' styles withing the 'themes.xml'
file in 'res/values', and thus now become the default, as the
'minSdkVersion' is now '24'.
