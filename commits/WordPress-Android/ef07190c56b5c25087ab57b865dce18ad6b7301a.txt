Fixed up UX for StatsVisitorsAndViewsFragment:

 * Extracted out the bar char views into their own fragment. This allows the data below the chart to only be loaded once (instead of loaded in 3 separate fragments like it was previously)
 * Fixed wonky reload of bar chart data. Instead of removing all of the views, we just check for an existing bar graph and update its data if it exists.
