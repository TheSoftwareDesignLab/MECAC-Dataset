- Fix  highlight in the "Countries", "Followers" and "Comments" modules. The app was showing a selection even though nothing happens when you click them.
- Fix the "null view root"  issue reported by Inspector. Props @nbradbury
- Use a lighter text color for checked tabs in Visitors and Views. (Used the same color of the web).
