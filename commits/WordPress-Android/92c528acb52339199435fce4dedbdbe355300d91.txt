Disable overscroll animation on main plugins screen

This is done because it seems that the animation may lead to the
expectation that swiping down will refresh the contents of this screen.
In fact, this screen does not have a multi-list refresh implemented, and
each individual plugins list can be refreshed by tapping into the detail
view.
