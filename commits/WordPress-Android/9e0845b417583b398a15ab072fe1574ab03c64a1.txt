Analysis: Add missing nl-a to site field

FYI: 'nl-a' stands for 'nullable annotation'.

PS: This change also remove the 'site' parameter on the
'CommentActions.OnCommentActionListener' interface and its
'onModerateComment(...)' method as it is actually unused. To verify
that look at the 'CommentsDetailActivity' class and its implemetation of
the 'onModerateComment(...)' interface method.
