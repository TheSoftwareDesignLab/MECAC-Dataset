feat: Add skeleton code VideoPress media processor

The skeleton code for the VideoPress block's media processor has been added with this commit. Its functionality will be fleshed out in future commits. For now, it follows the same pattern as other block processors.

The audio block was followed the most closely, given it was the newest processor at the time of writing: https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/blob/d609fa52b6c600da9c23f37f60053bbb79bb811b/WordPress/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/ui/posts/mediauploadcompletionprocessors/AudioBlockProcessor.kt
