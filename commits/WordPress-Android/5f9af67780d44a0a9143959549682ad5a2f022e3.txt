Analysis: Resolve empty function block warning for quick start store

Description: "Reports empty functions. Empty blocks of code serve no
purpose and should be removed. This rule will not report functions with
the override modifier that have a comment as their only body contents
(e.g., a // no-op comment in an unused listener function).

Set the [ignoreOverridden] parameter to 'true' to exclude all functions
which are overriding other functions from the superclass or from an
interface (i.e., functions declared with the override modifier)."
