Manually fix linter errors

1. Moved the `notification_channel_*` strings back where they initially were in the `strings.xml` file (and thus under the appropriate `<!-- … -->` XML comment providing context about them).
   - The reason why they were moved around during merge in #16251 is because those strings, which come from the `stories-android` lib, were updated in the `stories-android` repo itself to have `tools:ignore="UnusedResources"` manually added to them
   - As a result, our tooling merging lib's `strings.xml` files saw those had different XML attributes and thus removed the old XML node then re-added the lib XML node at the end, as opposed to just update its text content (as it'd have otherwise just done were there no new attributes)
   - See https://github.com/Automattic/stories-android/commit/d397e1947dbc7785b079b4a207aa826ce7c6b5d3 for where that was changed in `stories-android`

2. Manually added `tools:ignore="UnusedResources"` to all the strings that were added from the WordPressEditor module
   - We add that attribute to strings that come from being merged from libs, because the linter is not capable of detecting when those are used by a library vs the app.
   - Note that some of those might genuinely be unused (neither by the app… nor by the WordPressEditor module… nor by any of its transitive dependencies for which having those redefined here would be for the intent of overriding the ones from those transitive dependencies…), while others might be false positives (actually used… but it's just the linter failing to detect it)
   - In practice, we'd have expected that `checkDependencies = true` in `WordPress/build.gradle` would still allow lint to detect which of those strings from `WordPressEditor` might be used in that submodule even if not used by the app, and I think it actually does (because only 18 of those 51 strings from WPEditor generate an "UnusedResources" error) so we could have instead decided to only add the ignore attribute for those 18 ones but consider that `checkDependencies = true` is supposed to detect the rest. But we preferred to keep it simple and unblock ourselves (as this prevented me from building the app) and be consistent with how we do it for other libs rather than cherry-pick which ones to tag. We plan to revisit and audit all the strings to find the unused one at a later date as a cleanup project anyway.

3. Changed the exclusion regex from `values-.*/strings\.xml` to `values-.*/.*\.xml`, so that it not only ignores the `strings.xml` files from translated or variant resources (i.e. the ones ones other than `values/`), but also include other ones like `colors.xml`, because 2 of the Aztec colors were now detected as unused in the app (while they're likely used by the Aztec lib and we're just overriding them in the app)
