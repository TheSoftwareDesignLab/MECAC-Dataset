Refactor: Move threat ignore success message display to scan state screen

This is done to remove the delay in the ThreatDetailsViewModel so the Snackbar message doesn't disappear right after we show it and before the navigation to scan state occurs. This delay wasn't sufficient for TalkBack, as for snackbar messages, when TalkBack is on, it is set to 10s.
