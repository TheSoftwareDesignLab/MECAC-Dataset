Deps: Use androidx test espresso version for espresso accessibility

There is no reason for the 'androidxTestEspressoVersion' to be split
into two separate versions, the 'accessibility' related version to be
using an older '3.3.0-alpha05' version, while only 'main' one to be
using the more stable '3.4.0' version. Both should be point to the same
and newer version of the 'Espresso' library.

As such, this commit merges them into one version.
