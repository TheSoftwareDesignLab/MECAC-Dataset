Update strings for translation

Especially AboutAutomattic libs renamed some strings between 0.0.2 (the version that was used during last code-freeze) and 0.0.4 (the version now in use during this code-freeze), which is why we have so many new strings (the old names for those strings were removed as part of https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/pull/15809)
