organize activities

 - move all activities into ui package, or relevant sub-package
 - apply consistent naming across UI classes (mainly just adding the
   'Activity' or 'Fragment' suffix to the class name as appropriate)
 - organize activities in AndroidManifest.xml to mostly match package
   layout.  Also use full class name (including package) for
   android:name property. It's not strictly required, but the ADT seems
   to prefer it.

Additional class renaming may be helpful, but I preferred to limit how
much was done in this commit.

This commit should contain no substantive changes.
