Feature: Add nav bar base colors and attribute

Based on design feedback, the Jetpack related nav bar colors are now
updated to match what was agreed. That is:
- For the WordPress app, the nav bar colors remain the same, but
- For the Jetpack app, the nav bar colors are now update to
black (for the light theme) and white (for the dark theme).
