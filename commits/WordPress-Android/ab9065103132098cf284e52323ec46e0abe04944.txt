Build: Enable build config build feature for wordpress login flow

This is an AGP version '8.0' breaking change that changes the build
option default values, see build failure below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':WordPressLoginFlow'.
> Failed to notify project evaluation listener.
   > com.android.builder.errors.EvalIssueException: Build Type 'debug'
    contains custom BuildConfig
    fields, but the feature is disabled.
   > Could not get unknown property 'release' for SoftwareComponent
    container of type org.gradle.api.internal.component
    .DefaultSoftwareComponentContainer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation: "Starting with AGP 8.0, the default values for these flags
have changed to improve build performance. AGP 8.0 doesn't generate
'BuildConfig' by default. You need to specify this option using the DSL
in the projects where you need it."
