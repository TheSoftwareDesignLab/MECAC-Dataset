* Analysis: Suppress credential manager misuse lint warning on login mdl

This Lint warning can be suppressed because 'NoCredentialException' is
actually a subclass of 'GetCredentialException', which means that it is
already caught.

Warning Message: "Call to CredentialManager.getCredential without use of
NoCredentialException"

Explanation: "When calling CredentialManager.getCredential or
CredentialManager.getCredentialAsync, you should handle
NoCredentialException somewhere in your project.

* Analysis: Suppress set text i18n lint warnings on wordpress module

I18n is not actually needed on these specific cases.

Warning Messages: "Number formatting does not take into account locale
settings. Consider using String.format instead."

Explanation: "When calling TextView#setText
* Never call Number#toString() to format numbers; it will not handle
fraction separators and locale-specific digits properly. Consider using
String#format with proper format specifications (%d or %f) instead.
* Do not pass a string literal (e.g. "Hello") to display text. Hardcoded
text can not be properly translated to other languages. Consider using
Android resource strings instead.
* Do not build messages by concatenating text chunks. Such messages can
not be properly translated.
