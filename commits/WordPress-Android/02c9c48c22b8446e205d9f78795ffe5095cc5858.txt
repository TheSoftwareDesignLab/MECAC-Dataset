Cleaned up the posts/pages view.

Removed local drafts header as it won't really be needed in the new UI.
Cleaned up ViewPostsFragment.java a bit with proper private variable
names and better code organization.

Also set the list to use android:attr/activatedBackgroundIndicator for
highlighting rows on tablets.
