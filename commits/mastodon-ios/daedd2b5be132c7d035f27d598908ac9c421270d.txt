[Welcome] Allow buttons to grow with Dynamic Type.

The buttons now have a minimum height rather than a constant height.

Also made a couple minor improvements / bug fixes:

- Both buttons now react to Dynamic Type settings changes (enabled `adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory`).
- A layout pass is now enforced in traitCollectionDidChange to ensure that setupButtonShadowView is using the right bounds.
- signUpButtonShadowView now uses signUpButtonShadowView's bounds.
