Interactive bottom loading indicator

Because the system does not offer a built-in pull-to-refresh from the bottom, we have to construct something ourselves. A fully custom animation would be nice since there is no way to tell the SwiftUI ProgressView to display without animating (the way the built-in pull-to-refresh behaves), but this is a compromise for now: we reveal the basic ProgressView bit by bit interactively as you scroll, while also increasing its size. Once the load action has been triggered, the full ProgressView remains visible.
