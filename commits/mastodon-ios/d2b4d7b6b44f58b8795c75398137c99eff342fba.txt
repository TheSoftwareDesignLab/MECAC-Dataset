Refactor: Filter and Content Warning display and management

A large amount of change primarily to the view model layer, to make reasoning about the content reveal/hide state easier.

To prevent terrible scrolling jags while allowing the cells to be shorter when hiding content, the layout changes for content display state now happen before the cell is returned by the datasource provider and the tableview is reloaded when a status’s display mode changes.
