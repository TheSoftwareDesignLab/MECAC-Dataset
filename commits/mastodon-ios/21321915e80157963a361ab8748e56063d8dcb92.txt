Try VStack (non-lazy) to improve home timeline scroll

Still looking for a good scrolling solution.

This way, scroll doesn’t jump, but may not be quite smooth. Maybe this could be improved by keeping the number of displayed items small.

Also, scroll to top appears to be inaccurate when loading via refreshable.
