Fix layout for compact status cards and missing images

Key points:
- hide image view if there is no image to fetch or if none arrives.
- authorStackView needed to always be full width across the bottom, and needed alignment .fill to avoid having its contents squished to zero height sometimes
- new mainContentStackView seems to need .center alignment when the axis is horizontal in order to size correctly.
