Dutch + 2 remarks

1. When "Replace zoomable images" is enabled, I can actually zoom less than when it's disabled
2. One finger zoom somehow puts the image upside down after some zooming in and out. Perhaps EXIF-tag or "rotate according to device orientation" related?

(Not the right place, I know)
