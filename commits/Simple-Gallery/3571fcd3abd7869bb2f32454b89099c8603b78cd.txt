fix media store crash on deletion on android 12
- MediaStore crashed on deletion because the ViewPagerActivity got finish before the MediaStore.createDeleteRequest executes
- To fix, we apply the same approach in the MediaActivity and finish explicitly after deletion completes, if the media list is empty
- also, only refresh the UI when the media list is not empty to avoid UI glitches
- fix slideshow bug by resetting mAreSlideShowMediaVisible back to false when the slideshow ends
