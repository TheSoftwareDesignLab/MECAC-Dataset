Reset progress views on video loop

The previous loop method of seeking to the beginning at video completion ensured
that the seekbar and current time text were immediately reset. Using ExoPlayer's
own implementation of video looping means that `Player.STATE_ENDED` is no longer
reached, thus the UI no longer accurately tracks progress. Restore the old
behaviour by resetting the views on position discontinuity.
