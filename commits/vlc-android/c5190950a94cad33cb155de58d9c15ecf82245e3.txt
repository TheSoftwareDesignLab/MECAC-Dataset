VideoPlayerActivity: handle navigable media (DVD, Blu-Ray)

There are three different cases:
- Item is not navigable: same as before.
- Item is navigable and we are on a menu: keep overlay hidden, touch
  events will be immediately forwarded to the navigation module
  instead of showing the overlay.
- Item is navigable but we are not on a menu: add a "return to menu"
  button to the overlay
