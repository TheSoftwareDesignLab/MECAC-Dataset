VideoPlayer: refactor start/stop

 - Add stopPlayback that stop everything started in startPlayback.
 - VLC events are now initialized in startPlayback.
 - stopPlayback will stop and flush all VLC events and will also stop audio
   focus.
 - save playback state:  startPlayback/stopPlayback can't be called more than
   one time.
