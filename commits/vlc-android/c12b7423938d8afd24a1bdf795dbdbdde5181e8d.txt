Change the playback speed behavior by having an individual and a global mode

This has multiple side effects:
- Saving the speed is now synchronous in the dialog / Auto controls
- Restoring the speed is now factorised in the PlaylistManager
- Shared preferences simplification
- Better UX for the user
