AndroidTv: refresh ml after storage perm granted

After granting storage permission, if calling activity is an instance
of CustomActionController, it will trigger onStorageAccessGranted
callback. Added implementation to MainTvActivity to trigger ML refresh
on storage permission granting so that the main ui doesn't stay stuck on
the request permission headers.
