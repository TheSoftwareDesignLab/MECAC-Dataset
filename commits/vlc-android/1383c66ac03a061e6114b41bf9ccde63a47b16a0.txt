Video Player: Use StatusBar after Android 4.2

Android 4.2 (API17) adds fullscreen support, and gives the possibility to
show/hide the StatusBar without any resize.

Replace player_overlay_header with android StatusBar and ActionBar.

 - The StatusBar will display the date, the battery, the connectivity and the
   notifications.

 - The ActionBar will display the Video title, using a custom layout that looks
   like the previous overlay header. It's important to use The ActionBar and
   not a view in the player layout since the show/hide animations of the
   ActionBar is synchronized with the StatusBar.
