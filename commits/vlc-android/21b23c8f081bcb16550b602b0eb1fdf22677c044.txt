SubDownload: fix endless download animation

If for some reason the FileUtils.copyFile fails, the subtitleItem should
be removed from the ExternalSubDirectory's downloading items to change
the item's state back to NotDownloaded to stop the download progress
animation. Also nice to display a snackbar error for the user.
