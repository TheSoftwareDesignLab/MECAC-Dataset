link profile from the star/count on main screen

this is adding additional way to achive the same thing, which
is typically to be avoided but

- Noticeable part of people tries to tap it, especially newbies
  (see #1478 - also confirmed by susbsequent testing)
- similar interface element (score counter in the main menu) is
  typically clickable and links statistics/leaderboard.
  Even if such element by itself is not styled as a button.
- is unlikely to be confusing to anyone and unlikely to make
  interface worse
- is not requiring ugly code (most of effort is used by writing this
  commit message)

fixes #3698
