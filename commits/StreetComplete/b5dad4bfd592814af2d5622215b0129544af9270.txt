New image select, street side select, lanes select, max weight form (#6490)

also fixes #6560, fixes #5605, fixes #6239

... and many other changes:

- postbox royal cypher: "none" now normal option, not an "other answer". (Also, ask also for unspecified =yes answer, just noticed this...)
- surface smoothness: emoji-icon now displayed on top of picture, not in title text (it *is* possible to do that in compose, but I find this solution both easier and better)
- image select ui shall be the same for pictures and for icons (no more text on pictures)
- increased size of pictures for bridge structure and railway barrier
- consistent selection color/alpha (also for undo sidebar, team mode color selection)
- a little nice animation on selection of items
- max weight form looks a bit different now
- consistent appearance for all "last picked" chip buttons (consistent implementation, too; in building levels quest too)
- surface overlay also has last-picked buttons for the segregated (footway+cycleway) form
- the image picker overlay forms all have a row of last-picked buttons
- using a fade-out effect to indicate that a row or column can be scrolled (also in undo dialog)
- split lanes quest into two quests. Add quest: "Are the lanes here marked?"
- lanes quest: add "last picked" button that rotates with the street
- street side select quests and overlays: "last picked" button now rotates with the street
- street side select quests and overlays: don't show label of the selected item in the street side illustration anymore
- cycleway quest and overlay: the "sidewalk ok" option now displays the "🚲 OK" sign as a floating icon for better visibility
- in settings screen, moved language selection into own screen instead of a (screen-filling) dialog. You can now search for languages. Other selects in the settings screen (theme, auto-sync, ...) are now drop-downs.
- the dialog in the parking overlay are not anymore two chained dialogs but one dialog with two steps (and a back button)
