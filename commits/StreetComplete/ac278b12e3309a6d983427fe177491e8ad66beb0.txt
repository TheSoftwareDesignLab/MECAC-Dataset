use accent color for better visibility in some places

some elements were using primary color for text in night mode
this resulted in dark blue over dark gray, making contrast poor
now in dark mode orange accent is used
this results in better visibility
I decided to not use accent all the time as in day mode it looked worse with 'angry' orange or extra colour being a bit too much and not needed at all

entrance address quest mode selection has the biggest change
