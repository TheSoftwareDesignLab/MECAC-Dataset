Disable 3D buildings when creating notes (#1607)

* Add method to clean markers

Add this method to prevent crash when loading scene update

* Remove buildings extrude when creating note

* Add animation to remove building extrude

Update shaders.blocks.position valude when toggling building layer,
it makes building height shrink in a proper way

1. Since MapController.updateSceneAsync() takes some time to redraw the map,
   there is a short time that screen is blank.  So I delay animation by 0.7s,
   or user may miss it.
2. Seems like if there is no setting for shader properties in Scene
   file, updating them at runtime always fails. So I add empty value for
   shader.blocks.position in building style

* Revert "Add animation to remove building extrude"

This reverts commit 81bb3015c14628336a3d82f84be7473a26d3af82.

Well, due to the map redraw, this animation cannot goes with
"note pin falls down" at the same time.
To prevent user get confused, just remove it.

* Refactor code about Scene update

1. Rename toggle3DBuildings() to setShow3DBuildings(),
   more consistent with current code.

2. Wrap things need to be done with Scene update into
   MapFragment.updateSceneAsync(). To prevent directly call
   MapController.updateSceneAsync().
