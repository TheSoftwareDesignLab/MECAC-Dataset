Streamline Flows in LogsViewModelImpl

Previously, the code was not idiomatic to how Kotlin Flows work.
This is corrected with this commit.

To do so, a separate function is used to create a callback flow on the logs controller.
This is then called per new filter, and provided to the UI in that fashion.
