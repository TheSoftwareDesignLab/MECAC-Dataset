Add new quest for type of car wash (#500)

* Add new quest for type of car wash

* Add other answer for automated=yes and self_service=yes

* Changed quest and question so that the user can select both answers

* Added new other answer (Staff cleans the car), changed icon and removed unnecessary string

* Changed layout so that the bottom sheet does not need to be pulled up

* Added new answer: Staff cleans the car

* Swapped images, added correct icon

* Removed unnecessary import statement

* make UI nicer (no "error message", instead user can simply not select wrong things)

Also:
- found a better photo for "staff cleans car"
- simplified code
