Improve readability of location betterThan check

- Convert early return back to an if statement and convert comparison to
  an extension function, for better readability at the call site.

- Replace broken link with an archive.org version that works.

- Use consistent brace style for the early `if ... return` statements

- Rename 'Significantly' to 'Much'. Shorter = easier to parse.

- Rename `currentBestLocation` to `previous`, also shorter, and the
  previous location isn't *necessarily* the previous best, it could be
  used to compare any two locations.

- Remove redundant `return` statement (inside and outside the `when`).
