don't support cycle tracks etc. on contra-flow-side of road that go into flow-direction for re-survey

Otherwise, these roads would be displayed wrongly in the UI, prompting users wanting to correct the (probably) already correct tagging. If StreetComplete does not know a certain cycleway tagging, it does not ask again.
