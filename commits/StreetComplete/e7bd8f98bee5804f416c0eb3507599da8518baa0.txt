fix: do not use synchronized in suspending code, it blocks the thread(!)

Also, provide an explanation for why the updateJob stuff exists and increase readability of the implementation plus performance:
- no need to have the list creation on the main thread
- yield, withContext and withLock all check for cancellation
- deal with elements that are no longer in the viewport correctly
