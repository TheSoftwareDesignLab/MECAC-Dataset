make rejecting cancellation more clear

There is a "Discard input?" menu appearing after user fills answer, at least partially and tries to leave answer window.

It has options "cancel" and "discard" with "cancel" being not entirely clear - as user is cancelling filling of the quest. And "cancel cancelling" is tricky.

Situation is even worse in some translations where even the best found text is more confusing than English version.
