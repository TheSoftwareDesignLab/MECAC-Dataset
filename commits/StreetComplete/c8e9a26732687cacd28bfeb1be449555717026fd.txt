Move quest filtering logic to ViewModel (#6205)

* Move quest filtering logic to ViewModel

Refactors the quest filtering logic by relocating it from the Composable
layer to the `QuestSelectionViewModel`.

Key changes:
- Introduced a `ResourceProvider` interface and `DefaultResourceProvider`
  implementation to abstract string resource access, decoupling the
  ViewModel from the `Context`.
- Improved performance by preloading quest titles and using a `StateFlow` to manage and update the filtered quest list efficiently.
- `QuestSelectionViewModel` now uses `ResourceProvider` to preload quest
  titles required for filtering.
- Filtering logic moved into the ViewModel, operating on the preloaded
  titles. The core logic (case-insensitive, contains all query words)
  remains the same.
- The filtered quest list is managed and exposed via a `StateFlow` for
  efficient UI updates.

Add Compose annotations to quest selection classes

Adds `@Immutable` annotations to `QuestType` and `QuestSelection` classes to improve Compose performance by allowing the runtime to skip recompositions when these objects have not changed. It also adds a remembered lambda for toggling quest selection and a content type to the `itemsIndexed` call in `QuestSelectionList.kt` for further optimization.

* Add locale change handling in QuestSelection and ShowQuestForms screens

This commit introduces locale change handling in the `QuestSelectionScreen` and `ShowQuestFormsScreen`. It ensures that the quest titles are reloaded when the locale configuration changes.

Key changes:
- Added a `LaunchedEffect` that triggers `viewModel.onConfigurationChanged()` when `LocalConfiguration.current.locale` changes.
- Implemented `onConfigurationChanged()` in `QuestSelectionViewModel` and `ShowQuestFormsViewModel` to call `loadQuestTitles()` when triggered.

* Simplify search text handling in ShowQuestFormsViewModel and QuestSelectionViewModel

This commit refactors the `searchText` handling in `ShowQuestFormsViewModel` and `QuestSelectionViewModel` to use `String` directly instead of `TextFieldValue`. This simplifies the code and improves readability. Additionally, it updates the `ExpandableSearchField` and top app bars to work with the `String` type for search text.
