Solve or create note with photo (#655)

* Add possibility to attach a photo during note creation or while taking part in a note discussion

* Fix issues for the attachment of photos

* Revert removal of external storage permission, fix tests and save the image paths for a note discussion correctly

* Improvements on the ImageUploader

- removed unnecessary asynchronous code
- abstracted LutimImageUploader to not do anything else than upload images (not delete them, not create the text to put into note)
- Local images are only deleted after the whole process of uploading a note is successful and the note is removed from DB
- note upload uses ImageUploader interface and does neither create nor care what kind of upload service is used
- inject actual LutimImageUploader with base url only at module level

* fix  broken tests

* Center button, remove unnecessary code and other fixes

* Fixed serialization issues, removed unnecessary code and reduced duplicate code

* Better communication between fragments

* add tests for Daos

* rename a layout file

* fix hardcoded size dimensions by using device independent pixels

* add LutimImageUploader test

* rename privacy note addendum string key

* add tests for CreateNoteUpload and OsmNoteQuestChangesUpload

* remove duplicated code that I introduced earlier

* better error-handling for LutimImageUploader: at least log the error

* - replace GridAdapter with RecyclerView

  - performance improvements
  - adapter takes care of creating thumbnails
- have a X button to delete the attached photos
- attached images that are deleted are actually deleted now
- take photo button is a normal button now
- various improvements on AttachPhotoFragment
  - more exception handling
  - rescaling the taken photo
  - keep state on rotation of phone
- fixed nested fragments error
- fixed exif rotation

* nullchecks for programmatically added fragments

* make MapFragment also add its child fragment programmatically instead of layout xml

* slight adaption to exception handling
