make the on orientation sensor callback not on the UI thread (fixes #1047)

- handle orientation sensor callback not on a background thread
- have yet another thread dispatch the rotation to the listener, employing a frame limiter (to 30fps)
- also, correct the calculation for when the display is rotated
