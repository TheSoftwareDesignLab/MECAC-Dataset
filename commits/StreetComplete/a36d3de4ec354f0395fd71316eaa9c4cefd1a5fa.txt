rework settings layout

I reworked setting layout based on what people actually want to change. My testing has a small sample size. But for now basically all people were interested in quest list - at least viewing it. Some also in changing. Some even started given unprompted advice to make it far more prominent.

So it is moved higher while some settings much less likely/useful to change were downgraded into advanced settings.

in UX testing multiple people that reached settings menu declared that quest selection should not be hidden in advanced settings

I also shown quest list to some people after UX testing session and reactions where mix of
- why I was not aware that X is disabled? I am very interested in this topic.
- it is interesting
- it is amazing
- I really like icon X (often for the underground buldings)
- I was not aware that there are some many question types
- it should be displayed on first startup (I am pretty sure that it would have more negatives than positives).

Also some people using SC declared that it should be less hidden.

So it is promoted higher, out of advanced settings, visible without scrolling settings list.

I also downgraded cache size into advanced, in normal operation there is no need to change it.

I removed separate single element theme and cache group as unnecessary.
