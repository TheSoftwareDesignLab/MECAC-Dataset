fix cycleway tests

the below are actually fixes for bugs, which however should not have surfaced in the actual app because it is not possible to set the cycleway situation for only one side of a road when the other side has already been defined in the UI:

1. be more cautious when determining that the road is (now) also a oneway for cyclists: It can only safely be said when both sides are defined
2. retain oneway:bicycle information when translating old style tags to new style tags
