disable AddBuildingLevels by default

see #4264 - it is really confusing and time-confusing for mappers
it has some value, but given massive effort to collect this...
obviously, it can be still enabled by anyone interested

quote from ux report: '
One of the universally observed things: surveying building levels is really confusing, time-consuming and dominates other tasks.

It is quite depressing to see how much effort is getting consumed by this quest.

I would seriously consider disabling it by default. This quest is confusing, extremely time-consuming, with limited benefits, often unclear or hard to answer and boring.

It is quite sad to see how much effort it consumes, its enablement by default is likely discouraging potential mappers, and overall reducing the value of quest mapped. Disabling it by default would result in an immediate drop, but I expect that overall greater retention would be helpful - especially when quests would be weighted by value).
