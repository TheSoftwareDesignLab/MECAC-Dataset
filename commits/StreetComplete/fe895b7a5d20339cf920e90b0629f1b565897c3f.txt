Remove leisure=marina from wheelchair quest

fixes #3270

1. sailing with people on wheelchair is a quite special operation - and getting such person via gangplank to the yacht is going to trump any marina inaccessibility

2. it is unclear what is supposed to be checked by mapper

3. marinas are large enough that parts can be accessible and parts not and that is better to be mapped by mapping highway=steps etc

4. This quest will be still asked separately for restaurants/shops etc in marinas where this question makes sense

Note that it is distinct from tadgging wheelchair accessibility of ferries and ferry terminals
