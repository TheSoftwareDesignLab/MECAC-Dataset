ui: ensure updateOkButtonEnablement() runs after buttons exist in ShopGoneDialog (#6322)

updateOkButtonEnablement() was called during init when getButton(BUTTON_POSITIVE)
may return null. Move to show() after super.show() to ensure button state
update actually executes, addressing potential timing issue.
