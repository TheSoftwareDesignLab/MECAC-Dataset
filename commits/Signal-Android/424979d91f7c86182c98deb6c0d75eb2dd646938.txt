Fix reaction overlay not showing on first try in RTL mode.

Moved the code that does some layouts according to the view's layout direction to the place where we can safely use the value from getLayoutDirection().

This fixes the issue reported in [the beta 5.3 forum](https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-5-3-release/25088/315).
