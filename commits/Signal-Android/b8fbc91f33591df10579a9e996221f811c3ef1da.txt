Only show copy if text is selected, remove newlines from copied text.

We now check if _any_ text is selected when doing a batch selection
to determine if we should show the copy option. Also, previously it
was putting in empty lines for messages that don't have any text. I
changed it so empty messages have no effect on the text that is copied.

Fixes #7472
