Fix EmojiTextView regression.

Using the singleLine attribute will make the TextView report that the
lineCount is always 1, regardless of actual text length. This breaks our
manual ellipsize calculation. Because you can't actually read the
singleLine attribute at runtime, I've switched relevant usages of
singleLine to use maxLines=1 (relevant usages are EmojiTextViews where
singleLine was set and ellipsize was set to 'end').
