Revert "Listen to the uiMode configuration changes."

This reverts commit dda98a474de5108e95888b468129d36275223a5d.

This commit ended up causing spontaneous theme changes that have been
hard to track down. It's likely it just didn't fit into our theme system
well. We need to take a closer look, but in the meantime, a revert is in
order.
