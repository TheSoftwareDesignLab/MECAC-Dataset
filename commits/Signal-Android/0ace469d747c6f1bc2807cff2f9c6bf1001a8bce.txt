Support for multi-device.

1) In addition to the Recipient interface, there is now
   RecipientDevice.  A Recipient can have multiple corresponding
   RecipientDevices.  All addressing is done to a Recipient, but
   crypto sessions and transport delivery are done to
   RecipientDevice.

2) The Push transport handles the discovery and session setup
   of additional Recipient devices.

3) Some internal rejiggering of Groups.
