Improve passphrase and onboarding UI. Abstract out routing.

1) Update the create, prompt, and change passphrase activities.
   They are no longer dialog themed, and should look a little
   less ugly.

2) Update the import DB activity to be less ugly and more robust.

3) Abstract all of the state handling stuff out of
   ConversationListActivity.  This is now handled by RoutingActivity,
   which all launch intents move through.
