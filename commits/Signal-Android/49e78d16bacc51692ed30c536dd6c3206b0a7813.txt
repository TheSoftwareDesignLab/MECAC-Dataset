Remove redundant ellipses in strings according to Material guidelines

Quote :
"Use to indicate an action in progress ("Downloading…") or
 incomplete or truncated text. No space before the ellipses.

 Omit from menu items or buttons that open a dialog or start
  some other process.

 Midline ellipses (three-bullet glyphs) are also used to represent
 numeric truncation and the redaction of sensitive data, such as
 credit cards."
