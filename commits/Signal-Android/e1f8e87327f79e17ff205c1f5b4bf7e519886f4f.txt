Fix log submission OOM, improve log scrolling.

We were getting a TransactionTooLargeException when giving an
EditText a very large (1.5MB+) text block. This has been resolved
by switching to a RecyclerView to show the text line-by-line. As a
side-effect, this improves scroll performance on lower-end devices.

Also, I added a button to jump to the bottom of the log because I
really wanted one :)
