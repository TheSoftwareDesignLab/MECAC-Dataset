Dynamically calculate Glide stream mark limit based on device memory.

Replaces the hardcoded `InputStreamRewinder.MARK_READ_LIMIT` with a value that is calculated dynamically based on the device's RAM (scaling the mark read limit linearly between 5 to 8 MB).

A larger limit will avoid unnecessary fail & retries on high-end devices and improve performance.
