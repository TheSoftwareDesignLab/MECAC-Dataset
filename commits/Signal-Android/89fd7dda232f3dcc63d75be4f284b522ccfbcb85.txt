Break FTS queries into multiple prefix queries.

Previously, we made each full-text search query a single prefix query.
That means that the query "do c" would turn into "do c*". That means it
would match "do cat" but not "dog cat".

Now, we make each token a prefix query. So "do c" would turn into
"do* c*". That means it would match both "do cat" and "dog cat".
