Force LTR layout in this view because the "playback" button should not be mirrored in RTL.

In this specific case, the drawable (triangle_right) used in this view
is _not_ autoMirrored which is correct. But the `layout_marginStart`
attribute adds the margin to the wrong side of the view that breaks the
appearance.
