Gingerbread pls go

Look like an Android app from 2013.

Remove the redundant Gingerbread button styles from buttons to
automatically use the Holo theme on phones that don't run a 3+ year old
operating system.

Create a new style for horizontal progress bars that uses the Holo
progress bar style on v11 and above.
