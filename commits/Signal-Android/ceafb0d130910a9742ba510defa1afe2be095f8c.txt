Reduce emoji flickering and other ellipsize woes.

1. Switch to using default text rendering if there's no emoji present in
the string.

2. Reduce redudant redraws by skipping of setText() calls for identical
strings.

Together, these two changes should reduce the vast majority of
flickering we see with EmojiTextView ellipsizing.
