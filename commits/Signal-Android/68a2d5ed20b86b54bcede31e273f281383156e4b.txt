Reimplement ProfileCipherInputStream using libsignal-client.

libsignal-client provides an AES-GCM streaming interface that can
replace the implementation in AES-GCM-Provider. Using it from
ProfileCipherInputStream requires some knowledge about the tag size of
AES-GCM, but frees it from the JCE interface.

Note that it remains a serious error to not read the *entire* stream,
since the authentication tag is at the end!
