Use onCreateOptionsMenu when to inflate a menu in order for menu items to appear correctly in RTL languages.

The bug was reported in
https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-4-70-release/16449/20?u=alan-signal, but it was not necessarily a regression caused by the commit suggested in the forum post. It is more like that the bug was finally exposed by the commit. Before the commit the menu items were not properly aligned nor translated upon configuration changes in RTL languages.
