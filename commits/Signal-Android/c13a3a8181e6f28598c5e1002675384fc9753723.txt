Fix "Group Threads" so that messages are encrypted when possible.

1) Change the MessageSender logic so that individual SMS messages
are encrypted whenever there is a secure session, unless the UI
explicitly specifies otherwise.

2) Change the MMS logic so that messages to a recipient with a
secure session are all sent individually, instead of including
those recipients into the batch plaintext message.
