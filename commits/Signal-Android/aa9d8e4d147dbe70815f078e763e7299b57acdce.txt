Add scroll to bottom button in conversation view

Added a FloatingActionButton to the conversation_fragment
that appears and disappears using the same logic as the
existing compose divider: appear when the conversation list
is scrolled away from the bottom, disappear when the list is
scrolled to the bottom.

Fixes #5651
