Fix responsiveness of profile photo edit UI.

There were various issues around the profile photo updating correctly in
the edit view. We want to make sure that what the user sees there is
what other people are seeing.

So I made some changes to make sure that when you remove your profile
photo the UI updates right away, as well as fixed most flickering
issues.
