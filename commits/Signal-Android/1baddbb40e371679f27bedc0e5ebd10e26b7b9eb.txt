Fix some oddities with message request behavior.

There was a weird case where how our intent checking could behave
differently when coming from search. There's also some funny
interactions where backups, where because the 'time message requests was
enabled' is reset to System.currentTimeMillis() post-restore, we thought
there were always 'pre-message-request messages'. Only mattered when
profileSharing is also disabled, so impact isn't huge. Given a lot of
this UI is going away soon, rather than doing the complicated thing of
backing up the true timestamp, I just default it to 0 to mitigate
things.
