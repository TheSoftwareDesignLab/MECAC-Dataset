Add Swipe-To-Reply in conversations.

Swipe-To-Reply is a progress based animation that is controlled
by the ConversationItemSwipeCallback.  We use the TouchListener to
keep track of the latest down coordinates, so that we can check whether
we are over a seek bar. The SwipeAnimationHelper is responsible for
actually performing the transitions as the swipe progresses.
