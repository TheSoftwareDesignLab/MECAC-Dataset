Fix for some images causing entire section to scroll horizontally.

See phab ticket T91702 for initial bug reproduction steps.

Also fix for non-infobox tables not being collapsed.

Added "More information" i18n string for non-infobox
collapsed table headings (as is used on Android).

Normalized table parent styling if that parent only
contains the table. (Eliminates weird spacing and/or
borders around collapsed tables - as was happening in
the first table in the article mentioned in T91702
which is the hebrew version of the "tel aviv"
article: http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/תל_אביב-יפו )

Upstream css has changed as well.
