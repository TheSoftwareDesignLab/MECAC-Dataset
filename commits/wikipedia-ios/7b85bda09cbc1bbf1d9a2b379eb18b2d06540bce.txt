Fix for Bug T96450 - history is rewritten when refreshing

- Added new discovery method: MWKHistoryDiscoveryMethodReload
- Use new discovery method throughout the code to determine what to do.
- Add discoveryMethod ivar so it can be tracked throughout the process of displaying an article.
- Fix case where navigating by long press on history would also destroy forward navigation.
- Fix case where "network connection unavailable banner" would stay visible even after the connection was restored and a page successfully loaded
- Move history updating to the last step of displaying an article so it no longer needs to be removed in case of failure.
- Remove "invalidate cache" option when reloading page. Reloading ALWAYS invalidates the cache.
(it was just bastardizing existing discovery enums to bend the cache invalidation logic to its will)
- Removed straggling ivar "didLastNavigateByBackOrForward" - check for the discovery method instead
(This was duplicative of the purpose of the MWKHistoryDiscoveryMethodBackForward)
- Rename MWKHistoryDiscoveryMethod enum values (they were snake up-cased)
- Use NS_ENUM macro
- Add a method on MWKArticle to determine if it has been cached or not
- Make -[UIViewController hideAlert] a no-op if the view isn't loaded
