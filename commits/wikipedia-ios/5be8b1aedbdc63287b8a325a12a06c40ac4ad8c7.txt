(un)register for previewing based on traitCollection

traitCollection might not have forceTouch available if the vc's view
isn't in the window yet (e.g. in search due to storyboard embeds), so we
need to do it in "willAppear" and "traitCollectionDidChange" to ensure
we're always registered when the view appears and force touch is
available
