Dynamic type for search results.

Conferred with Caroline about using highlighting instead of bolding
for the search term in the result title.

Needed because the semantic font Headline (which is bold) and Body
diverge at the largest sizes. Headline caps out about 2 ticks into
the extra large sizes, whereas Body does not. By using the same
font there is no diverging.
