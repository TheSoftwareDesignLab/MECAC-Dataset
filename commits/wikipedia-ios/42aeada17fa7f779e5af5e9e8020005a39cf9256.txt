fix crash when changing queries w/ & w/o suggestions

If we had to change constraints between search queries (e.g. if one had
a suggsetion and the other didn't), then we would trigger an animated
layout pass, causing the collectionView to access it's *now deallocated*
dataSource.  Step by step:

- Get new search results
- Start animating new search suggestion (or lack thereof)
- Before animation actually starts, set new dataSource, causing old one
  to be released
- Old dataSource is queried for numberOfSections
