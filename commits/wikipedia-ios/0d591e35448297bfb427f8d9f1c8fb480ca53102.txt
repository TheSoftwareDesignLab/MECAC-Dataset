Update the ArticleContainer VC to:

- To take a title instead of an article so it can work with fragments
- Respect the fragment in the title that is given
- Pass needed arguments on init
- …Which allows us to remove code that handles the title changing
- Remove the discovery method (now checking the history entry directly)
- Add logic to check if the history entry has a scroll position that needs to be restored
- Remove conformance to the WMFArticleContentController protocol (going away)
- Remove dead preview code
- Remove dead native article code
