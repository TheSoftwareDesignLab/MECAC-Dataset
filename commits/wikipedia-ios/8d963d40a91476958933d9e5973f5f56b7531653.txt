Fix display bug with multi-line native section headers.

To reproduce bug:

-Load an article which has a long section headers such as "enwiki > color".
-Scroll to "Color deficiency" section.
-Very slowly drag down until the section header above, "Nonstandard color
 perception" just begins to come in to view. If you drag slowly enough the
 section header above will, at a single pixel stop, flicker into view
 overlaying the "Color deficiency" section header.
