Add saved pages list Bug: T97779

Add collection view controller logic
Load saved pages from model
Use child view controllers to embed articles in cells

Adding TGLStackView as new basis for stack layout
Added animations for deletions and canceling deletion.
Refactoring to move the drag detection from the unused TLGStackedViewController to the TLGStackedLayout.
This simplifies some of the touch handling and makes using view controller optional
unless you need to support using the exposed layout.

Added category for enumerating index paths of collection views.
