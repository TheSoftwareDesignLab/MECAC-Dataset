refactor some date stuff add initial tests

- hour difference between device time zone & UTC was causing UI to show
  incorrect date
- date calculations for checking if feed contained "latest most read
  section" were wrong
- convert all NSTimeZone getter methods to use "abbreviation" when
  querying "UTC"
