Add auto layout support for home view cells

- Now using the waterfall layout pod which handles self sizing cells
- Moved headers and footers to nib (required for custom layouts)
- Implemented preferredLayoutAttributes for cells
-- Cells need to implement this to tell the layout what they need to be sized correctly
-- For the Nearby cell, this required some magic numbers.
   Should be able to avoid this if we setup constraints in the cell class as opposed to the nib.
   Will try this in a separate pull request - don't want to mess what is working now
