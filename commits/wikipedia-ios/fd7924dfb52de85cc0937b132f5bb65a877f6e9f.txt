fix WikipediaArabic scheme & add visual tests for save button control

also updated FBSnapshotTestCase to point to original repo since my PR
was merged 🤓. in tandem with this, `main.m` needed to be updated so that
our application had a key window when running visual tests.

The WikipediaArabic scheme was broken, by which I mean that the
application's locale & writing direction were neither ar-EG nor RTL
respectively.  For some reason, using Launch Arguments works more
reliably than the Xcode 7 "Run" options drop-down menu.
