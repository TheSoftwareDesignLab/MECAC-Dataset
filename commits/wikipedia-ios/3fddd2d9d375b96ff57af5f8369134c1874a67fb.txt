Search View Visual Design Fixes

Bunch of small fixes i have been meaning to do

- Bigger search bar - enough padding around
- BUG FIX: the underline button now shows the underline below the title, it used to do that only when you change the language
- removed the blur, most of the time blur is interfering with what we want the user to focus on
- recently search header now has base color so the cells pop up
- BUG FIX: more button when pressed used to be whole dark gray. now has better tap highlight
- Close button aligns with the search icon
