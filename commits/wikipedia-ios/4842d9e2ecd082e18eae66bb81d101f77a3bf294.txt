calculate number of characters to extract for preview cells

Did some cleanups along the way to get necessary data:

- Refactored our "HTML" font into a category
- Refactored home view section insets into class method
- Expose preview cell text padding in the header and gave them a more
  specific name
- Exposed max cell width as WMFSectionControllerDelegate method
- Refactored related section controller creation to ensure delegate was
  available at initialization (need maxItemWidth when fetching related
  titles)
