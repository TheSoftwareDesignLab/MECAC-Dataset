delay section fetching by 250ms, and check visibility after delay

this prevents us from fetching all sections as they're scrolled by when
the user scrolls quickly.  this allows the tableview more CPU headroom
to layout cells using autolayout, removing the "empty" tableview issue
when scrolling fast. this saves CPU by deferring/elminating:

- networking & JSON parsing while scrolling to only what's on
  screen
- number of times table view lays out its content (i.e. calls
  to reloadData for sections that aren't visible anymore)
