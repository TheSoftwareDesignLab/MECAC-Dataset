(Work in progress) MWKImageMetadata object interface

Feed with a 'pageinfo' API result dict, it'll fetch out the 'imageinfo' list.

Convenience getters provide a few particular bits of metadata as strings,
or you can grab everything as MWKImageMetadataItems from a dictionary.

Fetch an MWKImageMetadata from an MWKImage like this:

  [image metadata]

Untested currently. :)
