Per Rita used consistent height for phone ref panels.

40% of screen height for portrait and 60% for landscape.

This will enable us to scroll the tapped ref group up above
the panel because now we actually know the height of all the
panels, whereas formerly offscreen panels could have greater
height which could cause us to have to re-scroll the web view
when different panels were being swiped to... which was funky.
