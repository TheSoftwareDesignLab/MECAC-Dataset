Provisional JS shared lib wrapping alt text logic

Missing alt text links detection for experiment C (finding files
on the page that are used as images without alt text after you've
done an edit), implemented with regexes in common JS code with an
eye to experimenting with the ability to share this sort of common
logic with the Android side later.

The JS library files are included in the output bundle like the
assets for the webkit, but loaded directly into JavaScriptCore
for calling.

A Swift wrapper class, AltText, wraps the alt-text.js library
and converts the returned JSON structure to a Swift array of
structs listing any image links that didn't have alt text.

A CLI node test is included in the sharedlib bundle

A Swift unit test is included on the iOS side to confirm the
wrapper function works as expected.

Possible problems:

* JSC doesn't JIT-compile except in the special WKWebView space,
  so performance might be poorer that expected. If it turns out
  to be a problem, we can consider wrapping in a WKWebView or
  just rewriting the code to Swift with common unit tests.

* Maintaining a second copy might be difficult. No attempt has
  yet been made to make a separate repo, as we may scrap this.

* there might yet be bugs in the code

* Still need to port the internationalization support for the
  alt= and File: keywords in the logic! The English hardcoded
  names are used at the moment. This can be a hardcoded list
  for now of the wider set of languages but should be re-fetchable
  with some kind of script.
