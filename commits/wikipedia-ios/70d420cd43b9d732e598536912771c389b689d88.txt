EPC: More cleaning up/finalizing

Biggest change is the public interface, which used to be log(stream, schema, data, domain?) but is now submit(stream, data, domain?) -- and eventually domain will also be removed -- to make it consistent with EPC-MediaWiki's `mw.eventLog.submit( streamName, eventData )` interface
