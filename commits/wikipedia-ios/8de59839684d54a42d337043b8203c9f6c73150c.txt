Add accessibility labels to some elements which were missing them.

The elements are:
	- Title of Explore view
	- Close button in References view
	- Back button from editor
	- Table of Contents button in Article view
	- Icon for rows in Settings view (this was removed from accessibility elements as it seems to serve no independent purpose but illustration)

Also handle traits and isAccessibilityElement correctly for these elements.
