fix save button hit area & add preview cell visual tests

save button should try to be 60 pts tall, but compress when title,
description, and/or extract is long

important changes:

- embedding extract label & save button in a view to ensure they stay
  w/in a certain height. otherwise, cell height will expand to satisfy
  (apsirational) save button height when extract is long
- using >= constraint b/t snippetLabel.bottom <-> saveButton.top,
  allowing save button to expand vertically, or be compressed down to
  its intrinsic content size
    - also needed to add custom intrinsic content size
- adding UIViewContentMode button layout suport to save button to allow
  control subviews to be laid out along the bottom (or centered when
  using scale to fill)
