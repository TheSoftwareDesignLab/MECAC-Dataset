Visual tweaks to "Read more" (w/Vibha) and other bottom native bits.

"Read more" now sized by intrinsic content size of its search results
so it resizes vertically automatically to accommodate the number of
results found by the search results controller.

Set kWMFReadMoreNumberOfArticles to 6 to see it in action.

Better scaling of bottom tracking bits on iPad.

Fixed rounding of glyph icons on iPad in OptionsFooterViewController.

The native options footer is also now the scroll limiter rather than
the legal footer. ie it can't be scroll up off the top of the screen.

Better containment of Read More elements (the title label, the search
results container, spacing etc) with a xib.

Moved "add child view controller to container view" method to category.

Tapping native footer elements when TOC open now properly closes
the TOC.

Used Masonry a bit. Found what may be a bug. Opened a ticket here:
