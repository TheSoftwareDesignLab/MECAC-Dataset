Update `localization` binary so description files update when we build.

As a reminder - I followed this steps (as outlined by Joe):

if you compile the localization target for release, and put it in the `scripts` folder replacing the existing binary, it'll run with every build

select localization target > Product Menu > Archive > when the archives window shows up, right click the one you just built > Show in Finder > Right click that > Show package contents > Alt click the arrow next to Products > Copy the "localization" binary in  `/usr/local/bin` to `/your/path/to/source/scripts`
