Use stackview in WMFWelcomeContainer vc.

- able to adjust spacing between top animation and bottom container
  via stackview's 'spacing' param - no more constraint fiddling.
- able to hide top animation on iPhone 4 by just setting the top
  container 'isHidden' to true - yay stackview!
- also vastly simplified reducing top animation size (used on
  iPhone 5) - now only topContainerViewHeightConstraint has to be
  changed. (Before many constraints had to be updated.)
