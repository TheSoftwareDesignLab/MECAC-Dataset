Anonymous editing killswitch.

Syncs with config/ios.json at most once a day. Adjusts saving
interface to hide anon saving option if ios.json has flag for
disabling anon editing.

The periodic sync code is done in generic fashion to make
future sync between server and bundled app json files
painless.

Note: will need to amend copyBundledFolderToAppDataDocuments
to copy files and folders which don't exist in documents
directory after initial install. Right now it won't copy
if it sees the Json folder has already been copied from the
bundle to the writable documents dir.

Will also need to rename all of the "bundled" things from
this commit as they're not really bundled now that they've
been moved to the documents directory.
