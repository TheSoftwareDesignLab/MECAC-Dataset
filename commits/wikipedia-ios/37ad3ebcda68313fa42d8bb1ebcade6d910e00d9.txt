fix screenshot bugs

related to being able to drag certain elements to the top of the screen - without this the way "XCUIElement" "pressForDuration:thenDragTo:" works causes it to keep scrolling to far sometimes on some devices. this was causing some elements we needed to "tap" to not be considered "isHittable"
