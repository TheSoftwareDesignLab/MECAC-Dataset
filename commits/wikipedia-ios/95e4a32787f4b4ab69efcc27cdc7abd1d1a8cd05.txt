fix for linking to pages with fragments

* updates MWPageTitle class a bit, which wasn't previously used
* sticks it in the middle of link handling briefly to remove the fragment
* if there's a fragment, jumps to it after inserting text

todo:
* switch the JS scrolling to animate the webview directly; tried it
  but had some trouble getting it to work consistently
