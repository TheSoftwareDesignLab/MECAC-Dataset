Revert "re-add disabling scroll when text view in non-maximized state"

reverted because setting isScrollEnabled to false causes the text view to clip the last line of text if it intersects the bottom of the text view. we want that last line to remain so the bottom text view gradient overlaps it to indicate there's more text the user can tap to see

This reverts commit 8cba07d4a3db34390cf5a598b580bfeb8886c7f9.
