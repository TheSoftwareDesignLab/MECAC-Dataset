Refactoring of Language controller:

Needed to do this to better support things like re-ordering of preferred languages for the welcome view controller

Separating MWKLanguageLinkController into 3 operate objects to reduce responsibilities of the class:
- MWKLanguageLinkController - Handles loading of local languages file and the management of preferred languages
- MWKLanguageFilter - Handles the filtering of languages based on a given text string
- MWKTitleLanguageController - Handles downloading of languages for a specific title

Other minor refactoring:
- Made MWKLanguageLinkController a singleton to reflect its true global nature.
- Updated preferred language logic to reflect actual usage ()
- Removed C functions in favor of methods to improve clarity
- Removed some needed methods
- Added some array generic notations
- Updated unit tests
