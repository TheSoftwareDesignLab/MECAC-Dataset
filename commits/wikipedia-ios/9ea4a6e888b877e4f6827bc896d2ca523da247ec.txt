Fix for article centric strings not using article lang localizations.

Native element localization is based on the device's lang.

However, there are certain localization strings which appear in the
context of an article. These should always use the article lang not
the device lang.

Among these strings:
-"Contents" at the top of the table of contents.
-"Page issues" and "Similar pages" buttons at top of articles.
-"Quick facts" and "Other information" collapsed table headers.
-"Close" collapsed table footer.
-"Read more", "Edited by...", "Other langs..." and licence article
 footer text.
-"Read more" results (were not being retrieved from current article's
 language wiki)

This patch uses the current article's language when retrieving
these localized strings and read more results.

Bug reproduction steps:
-from "Read in other languages" at the bottom of an enwiki article, pick Russian.
-when it loads, you'll see the strings listed above all appear in English.

Since all of these strings are within the context of the Russian article,
they should be in Russian too. With this patch, they are.

Note: some strings may still show in English if translations
have not yet been received. (presently "Page issues" and
"Similar pages" strings will still be English)
