Implement Article View Controller

Added image, title, wikidata description, TOC ot native card

Hooked up Gesture recognizer to allow dismissal by pulling down the scroll view.
Added "redirects" to the search API
(monte commented this out for now as it seems to greatly degrade search
result relevancy for some reason...)
Updated Search List to update results when saved page status changes.
Hooked up save / read buttons while in "list" mode

Reset Search Position when search changes

Fix "gap" above UI in landscape
Updated Masonry
Used top layout guide for constraints to fix issue (needed newer version of masonry to do this in code)

Added Article Fetcher so the article VC can update the article.
Updated WMFArticleFetcher and SavedPageFetcher to use new API
Added some block typedefs
Removed unused fetch manager
Minor cleanup to the SavedPages fetcher

Known issues:
- if single card it won't scroll until you tap on it, even though it's fullscreen
- in card view you can drag a card right to remove it, but if you drag left the
card immediately disappears

Todo:
- needs i18n
- decide how much of first paragraph we want show... showing all right now, using
share-a-fact snippet extraction code presently
