Fix for too much whitespace beneath article title on landscape.

To reproduce bug:

-load page with a lead image
-restart the app
-don't touch anything, just rotate landscape
-there should be the proper amount of whitespace beneath the title
-now rotate back to portrait and carefully tap once on some article whitespace
-now rotate landscape, there will be too much space beneath title

The problem was the com bridge's queueing flag was being set
to YES when non-page load messages were being sent. Also, in
the case a page load failed, the queueing flag was not being reset.
