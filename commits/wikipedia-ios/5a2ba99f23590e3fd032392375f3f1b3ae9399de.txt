Implementing Search in new UI

Bug T102362

Wrapped Search Logic in Promisekit
- Add promise kit
- Add WMFSearchFetcher - "wrapper" class for existing search logic
- Map Search results JSON to MWKArticles (no more passing dictionaries)
- Created WMFSearchResults model object

Implemented WMFSearchViewController
- Added Article List View Controller as child of Search VC
- Implemented ArticleListDataSource on WMFSearchResults
- Move article list data source protocol to its own file
- Implemented search when longer than 2 characters logic
- Partially implemented "did you mean"

Show Search VC and update Main Article List when search begins
- Add layout to "minimize" main list
- Switch to minimized layout when search becomes active

Misc
- Add nullability annotations to various classes
- Add BlocksKit to the Global header
- Created storyboard category
