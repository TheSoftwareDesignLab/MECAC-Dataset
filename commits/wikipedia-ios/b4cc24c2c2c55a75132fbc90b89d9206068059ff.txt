Avoid disabling deselection of text with a tap

We were running event.preventDefault() on touchend when tapping
on non-links. This had the side effect of breaking the automatic
handling of deselection of selected text when tapping.

Doesn't seem to be a need to prevent default behavior here, so
took it out.
