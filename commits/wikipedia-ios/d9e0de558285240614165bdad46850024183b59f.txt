Added Tab Bar to main UI

T105018

Updated Storyboard to add tab bar
Updated main UI to respond to the search becoming active/inactive
(removed old constraint code )
No longer needed bottom stack layout when search is visible
Added a category to animate the tab bar on/off screen in a tab bar controller

TBD:
List animation is now a little wonky because we have the tab bar…
but waiting to address until we decide on the navigation stack structure
