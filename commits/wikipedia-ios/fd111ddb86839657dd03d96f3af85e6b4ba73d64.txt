Fix deletion animation

bug: T105814

Migrated deletion logic to use snapshotting instead of actually moving the cells.
This prevents the collection view from "optimizing" by removing cells from view if they go off screen
This also allows more control over animation… like springiness.
Added some convenience methods to the UICollectionView category for getting screenshots, index paths, and frames of cells.
