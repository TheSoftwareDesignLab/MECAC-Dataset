Fix for image saving bug.

Steps to reproduce bug:
-Load the "world heritage site" enwiki article.
-Tap on lead image.
-Wait for higher res image to load.
-Close gallery.
-Tap back arrow,
-Tap forward arrow to reload the heritage article.

The lead image will not be showing the high res version
retrieved by the gallery.

With this fix it will be. The problem is the MWKArticle's
"images" list still wasn't getting updated.
