Native component beneath webView.

Discovered better way to make native view track web view
with autolayout. Factored to category on UIWebView for
easy top or bottom placement of tracking view.

Made lead image use the new category.

Moved article footer from html/css to native
component tracking bottom of article.

Made tracking containment use intrinsic content size
rather than hard-coded height constraints.
