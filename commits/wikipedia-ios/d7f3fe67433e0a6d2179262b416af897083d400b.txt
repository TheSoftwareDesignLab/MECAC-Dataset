MediaWikiKit static library with new data helper classes

Some current issues:
* searching loads articles, but clicking links reloads the current article
* pretty sure thumbnails are not getting cached properly with the URL cache;
  it may be wise to make them explicitly separate
* History entries not saved on navigation properly?
* Saved page entries not saved? (crashes)
