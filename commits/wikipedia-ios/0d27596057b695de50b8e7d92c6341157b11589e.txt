Fix T124593: Implement accessibility escape

This is implemented in:
- **Settings** (alternative to Close button)
- **Search** (alternative to Close button)
- **Languagesn** (alternative to Close button)
- **Image viewer** (alternative to Close button)
- **Table of Contents** (currently not possible in any other way)
- **Section Editor** (alternative to Back button; truth to be told,
                      Section Editor cannot be entered with VoiceOver
                      and Switch Control currently; but that is for
                      another bug)

Tested with VoiceOver and Switch Control on iOS 9.2.1 (13D15).
