Tweaks which seem to work.

Noticed one bug - if you scroll the announcement completely offscreen
then back onscreen it's not calling preferredLayoutAttributesFittingAttributes
again and the announcement description goes from 4 lines to 2 lines.

Needs to call preferredLayoutAttributesFittingAttributes again... hmm...
