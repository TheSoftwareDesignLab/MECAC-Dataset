restyle language picker to use search bar

User-visible changes:

- Picker is now grouped instead of having titled sections
- Rows in the picker are sorted alphabetically
- Rows in the picker are sized according to "preferred" or "other"
- Language filtering is done via search bar below the top toolbar
- Language cells now show the languages "autonym" (e.g. English,
  Deutsch, Francais, etc.) and the localized page title
- Re-added unsupported language codes, since displaying certain
  languages (e.g. Aramaic translation of Barack Obama & Aramaic
  Wikipedia) shows unicode boxes.

Code changes:

- Language links are now proper model objects, w/ their own response
  serializer
- LanguagesVC doesn't fetch/sort anything now, all moved to
  MWKLanguageLinkController
