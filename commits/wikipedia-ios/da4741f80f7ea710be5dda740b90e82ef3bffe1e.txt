Fix bug parsing image tags containing some special chars. Add tests.

Problem was noticed on "enwiki > Logarithm > Applications". Tapping
image from that section down were showing wrong image in gallery.

Was caused by special characters in the alt tags of some of the
mathematical formula images above that section.

These were causing NSXMLParser to fail.
