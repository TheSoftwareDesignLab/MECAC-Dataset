Updating the article list transition to fix display bug

- Explicitly passing in the view controllers for the transitions
This is needed because we need "intimate" knowledge to perform transitions properly.
Encapsulation is pretty difficult when animating internal views.

- Adding a protocol to get cell information on demand
This is the "real fix" - now we can get updated snapshots before the dismiss animation
(instead of using out of date ones - which was the source of the bug)

- using the new snapshot utilities
- updated some of the gesture code to deal with the new container view hierarchy
