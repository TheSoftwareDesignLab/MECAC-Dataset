fix for incorrect offset when scrolled to very top and nav bar hidden

repro steps:

- load an article with references visible w/o scrolling (ie refs near top)
- scroll ever so slightly just enough so when you release the nav bar hides
- tap a reference (remember these should already be onscreen and tappable without scrolling!)
- notice the ref highlight is not in the correct position after the ref is tapped
