Fix for regression scrolling on main page

The spacer div from recent iOS 8 fixes for ToC and scrolling stuff
wasn't getting added on the main page, which confused the scrolling
code that adjusted the final position to scroll to.

Switched things around so it always gets added, seems to fix things.
