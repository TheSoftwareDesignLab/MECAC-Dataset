manage navbar state when webview is shown

until our custom transitions can handle non-interactive dismissal, we
need to prevent users from tapping the "back" button.

also, there was an issue with where we changed the navbar hidden state,
as it interrupted the transition animation, causing "finished" to be NO
(which shouldn't happen).
