Use custom caption view for image gallery

Refactor delegate logic
- Use NYT delegate for self - this is because the delegate is responsible for many things (like the are button logic) that are better to implement internally
- Create a new delegate for the only external knowledge needed (the reference view for the animation)

Add overlay view or caption
- This was a class we previously had for the caption
- It is reworked a bit to use with the NYT gallery.

More refactoring for base class/subclasses
- Moved some more methods into the base class
- removed a method we no linger need because we are now the delegate of ourselves
