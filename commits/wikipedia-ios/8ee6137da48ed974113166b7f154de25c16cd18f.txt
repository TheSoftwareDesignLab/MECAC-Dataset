use MTL "merge" mechanism to append full-text to prefix search results

prevents redundant cell reuse due to:

- setting the same dataSource twice (even if we didn't go fetch
  full-text search results)
- setting a different data source w/ some of the same items (causes
  collection view to throw out all the cells, implicitly cancelling &
  re-fetching images)
