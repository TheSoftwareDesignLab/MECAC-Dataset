Made summary use attributed string settings from xib.

We can tweak things like linespacing with IB.

Note: once I set the xib to use an attributed string, it didn't
seem to have an option to select "system" font for the attr string.
I found you can just change the xib font manually by changing
the font in the xib manually:
  <font key="NSFont" metaFont="system" size="14"/>
