For now give acct creation captcha field focus on invalid captcha.

Holding off on inline captcha alert until login and acct creation API's handle captcha fails consistently.

At the moment we can't distinguish between login wrong pwd and invalid captcha fails.
This is because login api doesn't presently return a "invalid captcha" type alert like acct creation does.
