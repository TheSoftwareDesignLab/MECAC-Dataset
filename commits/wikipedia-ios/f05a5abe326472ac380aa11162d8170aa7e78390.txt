Add new UI structure. Bug: T101282

Moved all cruft out of app delegate.
New story board with just the app view controller and a few others.
Removed unneeded window category.
Added app view controller to handle the setup of the UI / control the splash screen
Added stub view controllers search, list, and article.
Added "style manager" to keep styling code in one place.

Updated data migration VC fro new app structure.
- Update to blocks based interface (remove delegate callbacks)
- Move migration related alerts into VC (and out of app delegate)
- Remove "super old" migrator (which was unmaintained anyways) to simplify logic

Re-add splash screen animation.
