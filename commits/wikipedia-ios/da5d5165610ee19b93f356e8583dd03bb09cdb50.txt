Reorganize javascript to have better namespacing.

- bundle.js becomes index.js - mainly for use with index.html
- new preview.js file for preview.html
- custom javascript objects now attached to a wmf object instead of directly to window
- so no more global js! everything is referenced through window.wmf.
- fix RTL not working on edit preview page.
