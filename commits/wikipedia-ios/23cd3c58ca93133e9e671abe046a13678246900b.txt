Add simple test for parser div leaking into mobileview output.

Checks if a pinned revision of an article on beta cluster has 1st section starting with expected text.

Will fail if parser div html again leaks into mobileview section output - the 2 times this has occured it has been as a wrapper div surrounding the section html.
