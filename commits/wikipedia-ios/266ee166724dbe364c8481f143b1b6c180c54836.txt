Add user dismissal completion block property to language view controllers
- Add userDismissalCompletionBlock property to set completion block
- Pass into internal calls to dismiss() method:
  - Close button pressed
  - Accessibility escape gesture
  - Language selections in cases where that triggers dismissal
- Add -applyTheme: declaration to header, so Swift is able to find it
- Note there is only one use case for the dismissal completion block at
  the moment, but it seemed a general mechanism that handled all user
  dismissal cases was the cleanest approach.
