Fix nasty crash in 3d touch capable simulators.

We were setting up a failure relationship for all of the web view's
gesture recognizers and this was making things all crashy on view
controller pop. By narrowing things down and only setting up a
failure relationship with one specific recognizer, we still have
our 3d touch stuff working *and* no more crashes.
