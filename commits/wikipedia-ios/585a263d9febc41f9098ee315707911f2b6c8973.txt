Fix search suggestion button suggested article string substitution.

- Now substitutes the title suggestion properly.
- Also now properly sizes the button if a given localization and
  suggested title causes the button text to wrap to more than one
  line.
- Multi-line button condition now also properly updates button
  height if device is rotated.
- Removed a bunch of crufty constraints from the search controller
  in interface builder.
