Update the preview controller to handle rotation

- Select a size for the preview appropriate for the device orientation (based on the amount of vertical space)
- Moved to auto layout to make the views resize automatically
- Removed snapshot - using actual views instead
-- handling rotation with a snapshot is pretty difficult because the snapshot needs updated which is impossible if the original view is obscured

Additionally:
- Prevent from being dragged above the navigation bar
- Documented the API
