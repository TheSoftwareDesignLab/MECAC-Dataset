Hide article view for accessibility when TOC displays

This prevents assistive technologies (VoiceOver, Switch Control)
from accessing elements that are not meant to be active when TOC is
displayed, e.g. the webView, back button and tab bar buttons. Otherwise,
these elements mix with the elements of the TOC when browsing with
assistive tools.
