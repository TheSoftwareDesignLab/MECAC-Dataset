Update ToC animator for interactivity

- Inherit from UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition
- Add gesture recognizers
-- Add presentation gesture to article container
-- Add dismissal gesture to transition container view
- Change animation type/cure based on interactivity
-- So drags look natural, and
-- Taps look springy
- Move UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate methods into this class
-- so the gestures can be interrogated to see if the transition is interactive
