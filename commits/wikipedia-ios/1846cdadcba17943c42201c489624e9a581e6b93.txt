Auth UILabel subclass configured with custom WMF dynamic type font.

To DRY up auth "link" type button configuration.

Reminder:
Used UILabel for auth "link style" buttons because they tend
to have longer strings and UILabel seem to deal with line
wrapping (think longer translation strings at larger dynamic
type sizes) better than UIButton.
