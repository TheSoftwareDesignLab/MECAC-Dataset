Presenting popup preview for article VC from web view

T101289

Added new transition
Refactored the Article card transition slightly to use the same verbiage as the new transition
(looking to converge these implementations using a superclass or component eventually)
Add pan gesture recognizer subclass to handle scroll view
Updated WebVC to use the preview rather than load links in the web view
