Fix for stretched native header-footer issue.

Fixes the too-wide native header/footer issue on pages like:
 - "Bern": see "Historic population" section - its graph can
    now be scrolled side-to-side.
 - "Goatfish": see "Timeline" section - the timeline can
    scroll now too.

Fixes issue where edit pencils were sometimes staggered from
right margin. Now they maintain consistent margin.

Fixes issue where section text sometimes had extra whitespace
on the right.

Removed crufty experimental css style - upstream css was
updated recently to improve table borders.

Added margin above top section text per Vibha's spec.
