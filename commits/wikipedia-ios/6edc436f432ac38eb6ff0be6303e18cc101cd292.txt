Add options to article view controller for it to not remember article.

We don't want WMFHelpViewController articles to show up in history or be remembered as last viewed article.

- As history items they are problematic if later loaded from the history interface because they would use
the regular article toolbar.

- As last viewed articles you have the same issue. When the app restarts and presents the article it would
use the WMFArticleViewController instead of the WMFHelpViewController.
