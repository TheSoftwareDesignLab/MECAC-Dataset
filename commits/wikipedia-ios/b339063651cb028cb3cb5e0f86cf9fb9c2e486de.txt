re-integrate zero processing state changes into UI

and several boyscouts along the way:

- now using a proper fetcher + serializer for zero requests & messages
  - using back-end X-CS=TEST param to override carrier to get test message
  from server
  - forcing use of mobile API endpoint (required for zero)
  - proper model objects!
- refactored alert presentation logic into zeroconfig state
- restored legacy banner in WebVC

and an easter egg! use FBTweakShakeWindowEnabled=YES in the environment
variable options to restore the shake window, very handy for testing
