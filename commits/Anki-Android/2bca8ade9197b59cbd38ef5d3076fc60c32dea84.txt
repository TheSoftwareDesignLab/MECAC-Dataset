Extend alternative themes into Reviewer by emitting CSS selectors

Fixes #5127 by extending the "dark" (vs black) theme into the reviewer,
previously dark theme was ignored in the HTML/CSS emitted if you had
selected it - there was only white and black

"plain" mode (the "white" alternative theme) doesn't affect the reviewer colors so
doesn't need any overrides in the CSS file but we emit the selector in case
others want to use it
