fix: navigator.getGamepads() does not work

* button presses were not passed to the WebView
* `navigator.getGamepads()` requires seeing a button press before
  returning results
* therefore the array was `[null, null, null, null]`

> To mitigate fingerprinting, getGamepads() returns an empty list before a gamepad user gesture has been seen. [FINGERPRINTING-GUIDANCE]

To fix this, pass through unhandled gamepad inputs to the WebView
