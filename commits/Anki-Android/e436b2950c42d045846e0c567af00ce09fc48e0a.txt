fix(card-browser): remove duplicate menu items

- Since NoteEditorFragment is now a MenuProvider, it automatically contributes its menu items when attached. The manual call to fragment?.onCreateMenu(...) is now redundant and has been removed to prevent duplicate “Save Note” and “Preview” entries in X-Large layout

- Added a check to remove the “Save Note” and “Preview” actions when there are no notes in the CardBrowser
