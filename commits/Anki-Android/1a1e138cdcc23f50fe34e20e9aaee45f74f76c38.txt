feat: enable troubleshooting dialog box for user guidance

Added a dialog box to provide users with troubleshooting guidance during critical operations.
This dialog appears when the user encounters common errors and offers solutions or next steps.

Key changes include:
- Integrated the new troubleshooting dialog into the main user interface.
- Implemented logic to trigger the dialog based on specific error codes.
- Updated the UI to support the dialog's appearance and behavior.
- Refined error-handling flow to ensure that appropriate guidance is displayed.

This feature aims to improve user experience by helping users resolve issues without leaving the app.
