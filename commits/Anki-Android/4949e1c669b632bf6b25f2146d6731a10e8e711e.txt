Refactor CustomStudyDialog to handle the STUDY_TAGS path

This is a no-op commit that adds the required code for CustomStudyDialog
to handle the STUDY_TAGS option like the other paths. The new code is not
used yet as the dialog will still go through TagsDialog.

For tags, the ui will show an input box to enter the amount of cards(like
the other options) but it will also show a Spinner with 4 entries to select a
card state to further limit the cards available for studying.

The enum CustomStudyCardState models the 4 cards states the user
can select from before selecting the tags.
