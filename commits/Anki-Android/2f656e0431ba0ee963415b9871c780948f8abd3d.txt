Fix fab size in landscape orientation

In landscape the main FAB wasn't preserving its starting when expanded
and this resulted in its icon being positioned incorrectly inside. The fix is
wrapping the entire FAB's layout in a ScrollView which should give the FAB
sufficient space to keep its original dimension.
