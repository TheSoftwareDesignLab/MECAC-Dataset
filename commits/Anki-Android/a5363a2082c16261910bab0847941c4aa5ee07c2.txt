fix: don't clear text when opening nav bar

We do this with a temporary variable containing the current value
of the search bar.

There was a bug with setting this temporary, which we also fix:

Toggling the navbar called supportInvalidateOptionsMenu
This calls through to SearchView: as follows:

supportInvalidateOptionsMenu => MenuBuilder.clear()
MenuBuilder.clear() => collapseItemActionView(mExpandedItem);
=> onActionViewCollapsed
=> setQuery("", false);

We had a listener on setQuery, which then blanked the temp variable.
class: CardBrowserSearchView fixes this, by ignoring these methods
if it's triggered by collapse/expand
