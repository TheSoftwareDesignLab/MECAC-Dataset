fix: new previewer not showing when only one card is previewed + change buttons behavior to match Anki Desktop (#15140)

* refactor: make previous and next button stick to the screen lateral if progress_indicator is gone
* refactor: turn showingAnswer into a Flow
* fix: card not appearing if only one card is previewed
  the WebView layout didn't have anything to anchor its bottom with all the bottom elements gone
* refactor: move displayCard logic to a currentIndex collector
  displayCard() will be removed in a later commit
* feat: make previewer previous button only go back like Anki Desktop.
  Before I tried to replicate AnkiMobile's approach of showing the answer, but it didn't feel very intuitive to me in my daily use, so I replicated the desktop approach
* refactor: inline showAnswerOrDisplayCard
* feat: disable previewer next button if last card is reached
* refactor: remove displayCard
