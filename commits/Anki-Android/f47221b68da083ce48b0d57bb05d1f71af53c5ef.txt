fix: enable automatic audio focus control in AudioVideoFragment

Recommended style, see: https://developer.android.com/media/optimize/audio-focus

"Note: If you use ExoPlayer, consider letting ExoPlayer automatically manage audio focus
by calling setAudioAttributes with true for the handleAudioFocus parameter. With this
behavior enabled, your app shouldn't include any code for requesting or responding to
audio focus changes"
