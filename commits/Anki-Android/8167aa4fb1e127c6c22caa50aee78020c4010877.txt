Fix swiping on snackbar moving other views

The way SwipeDismissBehavior uses ViewDragHelper, event interception may
happen well past the initial start of the gesture. ViewDragHelper will
capture the view under the finger, which at this point might be some
unrelated view, and *that* view will be moved instead. Looks very funny.

This solves the issue by never intercepting touch events unless the
finger is over the snackbar.
