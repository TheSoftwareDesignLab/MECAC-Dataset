Upgrade to Material3 themes (#14596)

* upgrade to Material themes

this means some changes in text appearance, color, margins, roundness, among other things.

please note that the app won't magically look like a modern Material app just with this change. This is just jumping in the pool before start swimming

* refactor: slide style

* upgrade switches to Material

* refactor: remove largeButtonFilledStyle

* fix: broken buttons with material theme

* refactor: remove NoBackgroundButton

Use Widget.Material3.Button.TextButton instead

* refactor: replace crash report dialog style

* refactor: remove some unused styles

* fix: align FAB buttons

* fix: get some colors back to what they were

* upgrade permissions screen to material

* set appBar color with a custom attribute

So the colorPrimary can be really a primary color

* chore: upgrade com.google.android.material to 1.10.0

closes #14518

* fix: reviewer "show answer" button color

In Material, it used `colorPrimary` as default

I left a FIXME at Onboarding::onQuestionShown because idk when someone will work on it again, and I expect that to be changed anyway when the desktop reviewer is ported

* refactor: remove "compat" themes

Nowadays, we don't need this kind of approach.

* refactor: replace getColorFromAttr

`MaterialColors.getColor` do the same and I prefer using common library methods, so people can reuse what they know from other projects

* change browser column selector height

* docs: remove comment
