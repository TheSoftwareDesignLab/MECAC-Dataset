fix: IPA symbols in Type The Answer

`liŋˈɡwɪstɪks` failed on API 33

Android's `monospace` font uses Droid Sans Mono,
which was missing a number of symbols from the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

We needed a GPL-Compatible monospace font for this.

GNU FreeFont (Free Mono) seems appropriate, as it has 4,177 glyphs
and supported IPA

I obtained this font from [0] rather than building from source
