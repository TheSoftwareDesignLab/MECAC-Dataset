Fix menu items displayed in DeckPicker when in multi pane layout

This commit is a combination of 4 commits:

BREAKING: Switch StudyOptionsFragment to use activity toolbar

NOTE BREAKING:
- the commit breaks the UI in multi pane DeckPicker because DeckPicker
(incorrectly) uses two toolbars, one from itself and one from
StudyOptionsFragment(which doesn't have one anymore).
- removes unrelated(rename/delete/export deck) menu items from this
fragment. They were out of scope of what this fragment does.
All these issues will be fixed in the next commits.

Because the toolbar is in the activity, the fragment publishes its menu
items through the recommended MenuProvider apis(onCreateOptionsMenu()
is deprecated in a fragment).

The changes consist in mostly:
- removing the toolbar reference from the fragment
- move the code from the configureToolbarInternal() method to
onPrepareMenu() which gets called everytime the menu is refreshed
- map the menu items handling from onMenuItemClick -> onMenuItemSelected

Move undo menu item handling from StudyOptionsFragment to its activity

The undo action is a global action and fragments shouldn't be the ones
that handle it. This replicates the desktop behavior where undo is a
menu option, available to any screens which only react to undo, they
don't handle it themselves.

With the changes in this PR the parent StudyOptionsActivity will be the
one to handle undo when we aren't in a multi pane layout, otherwise
DeckPicker will handle undo.

Switch to universal toolbar in DeckPicker

NOTE: this commit fixes one of the breaking changes in the previous
commits(StudyOptionsFragment appeared with no toolbar when the
DeckPicker was in multi pane layout).

A toolbar was added to both layouts variants of DeckPicker(normal/xlarge)
and that toolbar was set as DeckPicker's action bar which can now be
used by child fragments to contribute their menu items.

Fix menu items displayed in DeckPicker when in multi pane layout

NOTE: this commit fixes the last issue from previous commits where menu
items where not shown correctly in DeckPicker when in multi pane layout.
All previous introduced issues are now fixed and the functionality should be
ok.

Creates a new menu resource for xlarge configurations which has more
menu items for actions on the current selected deck(rename and delete)
+ some menu items contributed by  StudyOptionsFragment like deck
options and custom study.
Also manually increases the visibility of the custom study menu option
to have it available in the toolbar if the current selected deck is filtered.

Notice: there'a UI "issue" where going to deck options clears the menu
items added by StudyOptionsFragment from DeckPicker's toolbar, this is
happening due to the newer MenuProvider apis being lifecycle aware(
they add/remove the menu items based on the current lifecycle). Although
safer to use, they produce this issue. I think it's ok and once (hopefully)
the functionality of DeckPicker is enclosed in a fragment using the newer
MenuProvider apis, it would look better as the entire menu will be cleared
when going to deck options.
