Fix onBackPressed() deprecation in NavigationDrawerActivity

Created a back callback for closing the drawer and connected it to the
drawer's listener to enable and disable it dynamically.

The code was added to initNavigationDrawer method which all screens
that appear in the drawer(DeckPicker, CardBrowser and Reviewer) call
in onCreate().

Having both the drawer opening and the back gesture happening on
swipe from the screen's left edge isn't great.
