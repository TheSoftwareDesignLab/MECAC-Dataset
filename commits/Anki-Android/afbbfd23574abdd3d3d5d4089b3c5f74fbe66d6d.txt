[GSoC] Reorganize some preferences + refactors (#11934)

* Move HTML/Js debug to DevOptions

* Move `Card browser` and `Anki card` context menu to General

note that I changed their order: now, Anki card comes first and Card browser comes second
reason: Anki Card is enabled by default, so it's better to be seen first

* Move `Card browser font scaling` to Accessibility

To keep it together with the other "UI size" settings

* Removed check on GeneralSettingsFragment

If user had a restricted learning device, the app would crash as the preferences with keys of "widgetBlink" and "widgetVibrate" are not on the General category anymore.

These preferences were moved to NotificationsSettingsFragment on d302bcf and are handled there.

* Move `Press back twice to go back/exit` to General

* Remove `Upgrade to V2 scheduler` preference

142f789a7bddaf46fbc4f9bd7e32defd3e4ae84d forces requires/prompts to use the V2 scheduler when the user tries to study, so this preference is no longer necessary

* Remove `Perfomance` subcategory on Advanced

It had only `Backups` under it

* Reorganize `General` settings

New structure:
- Language
- Error reporting mode
- Share feature usage
- Paste Images as PNG
# Studying
- Deck for new cards
- Press back twice to leave
# System-wide
- Anki Card Menu
- Card Browser Menu

* Improve preferences_general.xml preview on Android Studio

Add preview title and summary for "Anki Card Menu" and "Card Browser Menu"

* Simplify `buildCategorySummary` calls

Add a helper method that converts the resIds to strings to reduce boilerplate

* Build `General`, `Appearance` and `Advanced` summaries programatically

And remove the old summary strings, as they aren't necessary anymore

* Extract `SettingsFragment.requirePreference()` to `PreferencesFragmentCompat.requirePreference()`

Utility method that was previously defined only on `SettingsFragment`. Now it can include other classes that inherit from `PreferencesFragmentCompat` as well, e.g. `HeaderFragment`.

As `SettingsFragment` inherits from `PreferencesFragmentCompat` too, its functionality isn't changed

* NF: Remove unchecked cast warning on `requirePreference`

Done by reifying the type and inlining the function

* Replace findPreference with requirePreference on HeaderFragment

* cleanup on HeaderFragment.kt

- simplify Advanced category configuration
- uniformize comments

* Add a comment specifying that dev options strings may not be translated

* Create a `Statistics` subcategory on Advanced preferences

Contains "Advanced statistics" and "Default deck when opening statistics"

And add "Statistics" to the Advanced category summary

* Move preferences not related to plugins out of the plugins subcategory

Moved preferences: "Text to speech", "Reset languages", "Chess notation support", "Double scrolling" and "eReader"

removeUnnecessaryAdvancedPrefs() had to be adapted, as "Double scrolling" and "eReader" aren't on the "Plugins" category anymore
