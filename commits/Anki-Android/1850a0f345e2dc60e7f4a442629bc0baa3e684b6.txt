fix: wrong input to "type answer into the card"

We handled onBlur and pressing enter

But, typing into the field, then pressing 'show answer' did not
have the latest value, so `input` was null and a comparison wasn't
made

To fix this, we update the typed input on each text change, rather
than onBlur
