fix(miui): disable "force dark" mode

Force Dark is an Android 10 feature, which commonly appears on MIUI 12

This forces a dark mode, even if the app doesn't support it.
We have a night mode, so don't need it

This causes many problems, as it does not invert Note Editor icons
causing questions about missing functionality

`android:forceDarkAllowed` fixes this, but is API 29+

To fix this, define a theme overlay, and apply it to all activities

Note: Setting a theme doesn't replace the current theme, just
overriding the properties, so a second theme is an overlay

This removes the need to to duplicate the file for `values-29`
