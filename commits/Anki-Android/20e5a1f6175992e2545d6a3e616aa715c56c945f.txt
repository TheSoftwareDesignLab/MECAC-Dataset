NF: Clarifying Compat's javadoc

In CompatVn I indicate that detailled explanations are given in Compat.java.
It was not clear to me at first that Compat.java not only contained the interface, but described the expected content of
the hierarchy.

I love examples. The trouble is that current Compat example are outdated, which make them hard to understand. I updated
them. Those example may become outdated again in the future. At least we will have had up to date example for a while.

I tried to rephrase Compat's javadoc. I had to re read multiple time to really grasp its meaning. I hope to make it more
clear.
