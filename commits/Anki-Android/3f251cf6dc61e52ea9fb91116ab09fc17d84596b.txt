Reviewer: migrate requested files immediately

During a storage migration, we have some media in an old folder
and others in the collection media folder.

Instead of handling the possibility of 2 folders, we immediately
migrate requested files when requested by the reviewer/previewers

When an image/sound file is requested, and is:
* not found
* inside the collection
* available for migration

Add a new task to prioritise it in the storage migration

Much better UX than missing images

Image migration: needs to be performed in `shouldInterceptRequest`
  as WebClient error handlers do not provide enough control to
  recover from

Sound: performed in the error handler to avoid impacting the fast path

The migration performance hit is not noticeable in my testing
