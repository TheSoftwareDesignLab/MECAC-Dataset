Handle corrupt CustomTabs implementations  (#6146)

* TEST: Reset Global state: CustomTabActivityHelper

We have global state that we need to reset to ensure correctness of our
tests, RobolectricTest will handle this for most of the test suite.

* NF: Extract disableCustomTabHandler

* Handle corrupt CustomTabs implementations

Some CustomTabs implementation will throw: SecurityException:
"Binder invocation to an incorrect interface". If we encounter this
problem, then we should use the fallback implementation.

Fixes #6142
