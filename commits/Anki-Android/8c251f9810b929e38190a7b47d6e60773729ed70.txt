[GSoC] Remove XXX replacement on preferences summaries (#11725)

* Extract some preference keys to constants
* Support formatted strings on NumberRange & SeekBar prefs
* Migrate Accessibility summaries to Android syntax
* Migrate Reviewing summaries to Android syntax
* Migrate ankidroid directory pref summary to new syntax
* Remove prefs literal summary
The code handles the change of the summary to the preference value by default
* Migrate the last preferences to new summary syntax
* Remove XXX summary methods
* Add a tag to preferences initial fragment
So it is possible to retrieve the initial fragment with `getFragmentByTag()`
* Remove mOriginalSummaries
It was broken and only used for PreferenceUtils.getAllCustomButtonKeys, which now is fixed
* Use fallback for API<29's theme summary
Instead of Android's default `Not set`
* Add summary providers to CustomSync and AdvancedStatistics
* Use `:useSimpleSummaryProvider` XML attrs
I've discovered recently that android has these for `EditTextPreference` and `ListPreference`
As NumberRangePreferenceCompat implements EditTextPreference, it can simply use it
And to keep consistency, implement the same on SeekBarPreferenceCompat
