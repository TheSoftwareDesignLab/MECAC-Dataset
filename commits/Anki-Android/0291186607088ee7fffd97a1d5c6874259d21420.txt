feat: Individual preference analytics

Analytics events have four parameters
1. Category (mandatory): String
2. Action (mandatory): String
3. Value (optional): Int
4. Label (optional): String

reference: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#events

For individual analytics preferences, a new "Setting" category is created, with two actions: Tapped setting and Changed setting. A value can be reported in "Changed" actions. And the preference key will serve as label

- Tapped "action": All tapped preferences at the Preferences activity will trigger an event
- Changed "action": Only the preferences inside an inclusive list are reported, to avoid reporting preferences that could potentially have personal data, or SharedPreferences used by libraries, among other reasons

The .setOnPreferenceClickListener calls are changed to return false, so `onPreferenceTreeClick` is called when preferences with a click listener are tapped. This change doesn't result in any functional change about the preference taps

The TODO about using constants at `UsageAnalytics.preferencesWhoseChangesShouldBeReported` is because I'm still thinking about how it would be best to organize constants for the preference keys and it isn't something that should block this change
