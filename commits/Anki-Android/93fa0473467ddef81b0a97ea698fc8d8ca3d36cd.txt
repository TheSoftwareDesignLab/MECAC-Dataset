Add "Browser Appearance" Screen

As defined in Anki Desktop: A user can edit the format string which is
 used in the Card Browser to render a card template.

This allows them to mark the reverse side in a card, for example without
it appearing in the UI, or removing JavaScript or media fields to reduce
rendering time.

This adds:

* UI with 2 textboxes
* Reset to Default button
* Save/Cancel buttons with logic

Fixes #5158
