Editor Toolbar: Allow Custom Buttons

This is API 21+ due to an issue with VectorDrawableCompat.

* Due to problems with the horizontal scroll view, we change to GRAVITY_LEFT
when there are more items than will fit on the screen, this uses a hardcoded
value of 32dp

An item can be long-pressed to remove

We generate the bitmaps ourselves, but deletion will change "1" from what
was the first item to the second item.
