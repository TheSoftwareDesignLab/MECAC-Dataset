Add desktop like UI for exporting collection and anki packages

This replaces the initial dialog which was shown in the export process.

Notes:

- I didn't use AnkiActivity.showDialogFragment() as this left the
dialog still showing after the export was done due to how the helper method
does the fragment transaction.
- This PR ignores a related test as the new code uses AlertDialog while
the legacy test code looks for a MaterialDialog
