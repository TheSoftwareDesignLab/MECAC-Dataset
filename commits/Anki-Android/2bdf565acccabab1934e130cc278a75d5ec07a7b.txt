Fix onBackPressed() deprecation in SharedDecksActivity

Moved the previous back handling code from the activity to the related
fragment. The predictive BACK navigation is done by changing the enabled
status of the back callback every time isDownloadInProgress is updated.

There was also a direct call to the activity onBackPressed() which was
replaced by the equivalent onBackPressedDispatcher.onBackPressed().
