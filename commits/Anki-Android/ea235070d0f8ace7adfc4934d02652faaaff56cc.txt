fix: 'auto focus type in answer' default

In the preference it was true

https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/4711b4c89a9a45da10781c93e7480d541860ad02/AnkiDroid/src/main/res/xml/preferences_advanced.xml#L92-L93

In the code it was false

Make it `true`:
* `R.string.type_in_answer_focus_key`
* `autoFocusTypeInAnswer`
