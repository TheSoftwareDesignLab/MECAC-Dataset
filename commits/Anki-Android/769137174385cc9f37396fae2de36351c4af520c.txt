Implement new backend for note types

This PR enables the new backend for viewing and changing notetypes. With the new implementation:

- add new activity for new backend implementation, ManageNotetypes(the old activity ModelBrowser should be deleted)
- full support for coroutines(and with progress) with all backend calls
- improve UI for the notes types list by using CardView(ideally we would use the material cards but we don't
  currently inherit from the material themes)
- fix some of the UX reported issues, like providing a uniform add action(by using the platform FloatingActionButton)
  and stop using the hard to discover context menu in favor of in layout actions for each item
- enable some checks for the notes types names when renaming or adding new entries
- introduce some UI model classes to better isolate the backend from the UI code
- other changes to streamline the UI and avoid pitfalls of the previous code(like double dialogs, issues with backstack,
  performance)
