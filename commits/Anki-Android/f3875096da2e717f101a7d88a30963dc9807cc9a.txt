feat(reminders): handle deck deletion

GSoC 2025: Review Reminders

Edits ScheduleRemindersAdapter so that if a deck is not accessible to the user, the corresponding item in the ScheduleReminders list is grey and crossed-out. This is done by `errorReminderIfDeckNotFound`. Since global review reminders don't have a corresponding deck, they are always displayed as active.

To ensure the style works with all possible app themes, I determine which theme is active using `attr` constants and convert them to theme colors via a `getThemeColor` method. However, since this method will run a lot (twice for each element in the list), I make it cache its return values.

Checking whether a deck is accessible to the user via `canUserAccessDeck` requires a suspending call to the collection, which the Adapter cannot trigger, so I moved this logic to ScheduleReminders with a callback to continue Adapter logic after whether the deck is accessible has been retrieved.

I also realized that this pattern of using a callback could also be applied to another already-existing function in ScheduleReminders that I thought was a bit messy: `setDeckNameFromScopeForView`. I originally created this method because I needed to retrieve the deck's name, which required launching a coroutine, which needed to be done in ScheduleReminders. However, the fact that `setDeckNameFromScopeForView` was also handling UI made the method feel impure and ugly. By using a callback, I can keep all the UI logic for individual list elements within ScheduleRemindersAdapter while still allowing the code flow to pass through ScheduleReminders in order to retrieve the deck's name.
