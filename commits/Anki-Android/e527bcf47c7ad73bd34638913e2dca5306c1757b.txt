Remove context receivers

The reason for the removal of the beautiful, amazing, and all-around
wonderful context receivers--as seen on YouTube!--is [redacted].

This also removes most of the commit Create & use a call-site withQueue.
The reason is that the alternative to using context receivers here
would be using a regular receiver:

    suspend fun Queue.deleteCollectionDirectory() { ... }

This might be about the same thing from the point of view of compiler,
but the semantics are different; a regular receiver is meant to be used
for objects that are acted upon, and Queue is not such object.
This is reflected by the IDE warning that Queue is unused.
