Clarify note type ui model

I found the code slightly unclear and tried to improve it.

* NotetypeBasicUiModel was not related to basic note types
* isStandard and useCount did not seem to me to have a clear meaning in anki lexicon, so must be document
* toUiModel can't be appled to a standard entry as far as I understand it, and is in any case never applied to a standard note type currently, so we can remove the argument.
