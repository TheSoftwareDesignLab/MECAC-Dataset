Add a search bar to the settings screen

It's necessary for all "PreferenceScreen" to have keys, so they are being added to the screens which hadn't a key

search:ignore is an attribute that allows to skip a preference indexing on a XML file. It is added to subscreens' preferences to avoid duplication of the results of the screens themselves and the preferences that open them

Added as well to "Day" and "Night" preferences to avoid duplication of their entries and "Theme" preference's entries
