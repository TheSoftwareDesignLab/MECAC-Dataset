Add File Space Warning before Check Database

* Extract: performIntegrityCheck

We want to add in a dialog box under certain circumstances, this is the
first step, as it allows us to conditionally call the 'meat' of the
method without changing the public signature

* Extract method: getFreeDiscSpace
* Check Database: File Space warning

We are having problems with users performing check database with
insufficient file space. This causes a crash.

To remedy this, we discourage the user from performing check database
without enough file space.

* NF: Rename CollectionIntegrityStorageCheck
* NF: Improve comment
* Timber.wtf -> Timber.e
* Reduced string constants in Integrity Check

Factored out default into code

* Dialog for Confirm Database check on upgrade

We added in a dialog to warn about file size if someone performs a check
database without space. This can come up unexpectedly when a user
performs check database, so we want to let a user know what is
happening first.

* Update content for check database
