Remember scroll position in CardBrowser

* Fix scrollbar's position not remembered in CardBrowser

The scrollbar's position is reset because, when user edits and saves a note in NoteEditor, NoteEditor sends a "noteChanged" event back to CardBrowser. In method onActivityResult() of CardBrowser, this event causes a reload, which resets the scrollbar position.

In this PR, I remove the "noteChanged" event from the list of events that cause a reload (in onActivityResult() of CardBrowser).
