refactor: CardBrowser - searchTerms (#15095)

* refactor: remove unused fun `selectAllDecks`

* refactor: extract setters of `searchTerms`

searchCards(String) is now the only setter

* refactor: savedSearches - use also { }

`this` was confusing

* refactor: extract `searchTerms` setter

* refactor: inline `searchTerms`

* refactor: extract searchForCards

* refactor: extract further code to searchForCards

* refactor: use setQuery(true)

Better to set the UI element to keep a standard
 manner of searching for now

* refactor: extract 'searchForQuery'

* refactor: searchView.queryHint

inline 'onSearch'

* refactor: searchView init

* refactor: redrawAfterSearch

* extract: flowOfCardsUpdated

* docs: fix comment

* fix: initial 'saved search' load sets text
