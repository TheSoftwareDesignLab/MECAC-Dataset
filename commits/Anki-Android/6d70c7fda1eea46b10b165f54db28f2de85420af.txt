fix: handle Android 15+ restriction on audio focus requests

Do not attempt to play sounds if audio focus request failed

See: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15#audio-focus

"Apps that target Android 15 (API level 35) must be the top app or running a
foreground service in order to request audio focus. If an app attempts to request
focus when it does not meet one of these requirements, the call returns AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_FAILED"
