Fix TabLayoutMediator attached before adapter initialization in CardTemplateFragment

In CardTemplateEditor the code was attaching the TabLayoutMediator to
the ViewPager in the CardTemplateFragment used in the ViewPager
although the fragment itself didn't use the tab layout mediator.

This is problematic because if the activity is killed in the background,
then the system will recreate the fragment itself when coming back,
leading to calling TabLayoutMediator.attach() in the fragment. This
will generally work unless for some reason the collection is not
available in time through onCollectionLoaded() which initializes the
ViewPager with its adapter.
