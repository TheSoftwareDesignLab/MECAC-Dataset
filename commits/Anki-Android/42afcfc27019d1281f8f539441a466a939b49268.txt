Mathjax output SVG instead of css

This should hopefully solves #7848, i.e. on samsung tablets, formulas are not correctly displayed.
The downsides are mentionned in http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/output/svg.html :
* it copy as image and not as text
* change in numbering of tags of equation (normally, cards are small enough that's not a problem)
