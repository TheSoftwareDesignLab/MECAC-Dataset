Solve codepage problems with explicit dash character

There is a character set problem with the straight line separator
explicitly defined as a string in the simple interface. On my EN-GB Nook
ST, I was seeing a unicode translation problem like "àE"" instead of the
string. \u2500 seems to be a safe alternative across character sets.
