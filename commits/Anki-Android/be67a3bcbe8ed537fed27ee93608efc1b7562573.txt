feat(browse): implement progress bar

Added bonus:
This means we can remove 'initCompleted' and don't need
to handle flow re-subscription if the user moves from dark
to light mode

Fixes a bug in the Columns where the preview didn't remain
if switching dark/light mode

* make searchForCards non-blocking
* stop refreshing searches unconditionally on state restore
