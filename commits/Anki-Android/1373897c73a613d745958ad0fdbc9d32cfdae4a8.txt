Update to Anki 2.1.54 backend

Squashes a few commits:

Move the legacy schema toggle into BackendFactory

Simplify backend handling; rework collection instantiation

When the Rust code was initially introduced, it was not clear whether
it would be usable on all devices, or whether it would need to be removed
for some reason. This no doubt influenced the design of the existing API,
which tries to make it easy to swap the Rust code out with something else.

Unfortunately this approach has some downsides:

- It makes it somewhat harder to follow, as method calls jump through
multiple interfaces before they're actually sent to the backend.
- It makes utilizing new methods considerably more cumbersome.

For example, take the extract_av_tags() call. It follows the following
path:

collection method or method in related helper class:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/cea79e1b077bc30e7eed8f37529002aae416d34d/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/libanki/TemplateManager.kt#L242

to generic interface:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/cea79e1b077bc30e7eed8f37529002aae416d34d/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/libanki/backend/DroidBackend.kt#L83

to specific implementation:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/cea79e1b077bc30e7eed8f37529002aae416d34d/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/libanki/backend/RustDroidV16Backend.kt#L57

and if it's unusable with the legacy schema (which I don't believe is
actually true in this case), it also needs to be added to the other
implementation:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/cea79e1b077bc30e7eed8f37529002aae416d34d/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/libanki/backend/RustDroidBackend.kt#L87

and then finally, a method in the backend module is invoked.

The backend module has code generation so that invoking a backend method
is as simple as making a method call, but currently you have to weave
the call through 3 or so levels of indirection before you can actually
use it. With something like 170 available methods, that's a fair amount
of extra work required.

Rather than trying to insulate libanki from the backend code, this PR
drops some of the indirection in favour of the approach the desktop takes:
libanki is the insulation layer; it can call freely into the backend methods,
but consumers (eg the GUI code) are expected to only call methods on the
collection, and not access the backend directly.

In addition to the above, collection initialization has been reworked
to be more similar to the computer version. Instead of the collection
being created from a database object, a backend is passed into the
collection creation, and the collection takes care of creating a DB
instance that wraps the backend.

Remove always-on isUsingRustBackend

Drop the legacy upgrade/initialization code

Schema 11 was introduced in 2012, and decks that still are <11 are very
rare. The desktop dropped support for schema 10 back in early 2020.

This also removes the need to modify SCHEMA_VERSION when switching
between TESTING_USE_V16_BACKEND.

Remove DOWNGRADE_REQUIRED and slightly simplify startup error handling

- The backend automatically downgrades when required, and possible. No
backup is required, as the downgrade happens in a single transaction,
and the downgrade code has proven itself over time.
- Store the type of failure in getColSafe(), so it can be checked later.

Update to work with desktop 2.1.53 code

Depends on https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android-Backend/pull/202

Due to the removal and change of a few backend methods, syncing, importing
and the card templates screen will not work when the schema16 setting is
active (actually schema18 now). To get them working again, those code
paths will need to switch to the backend implementations.

A few notes:
- Downgrading happens automatically when loading the collection in schema11
mode, so the extra code dealing with downgrades & "can downgrade" reporting
can be stripped.
- Added the ability to run col.set_config("key", JSONObject.NULL), as
unit tests were attempting to write the entire collection config, which is
no longer supported.
- All tests pass on both old and new backends, though the latter required
disabling a few failed tests when running with the new schema
(eg notetype updating).

Integrates, and thus closes #11579 and closes #11581

Remove the time argument to Storage.collection()

Collection does not currently take a time argument, and relies on the
global object instead, so this change brings Storage in line with it.

Reuse the backend when closing+reopening a collection

Avoids having to re-initialize the translations, and reduces leaks
(the import + export code leaks backends still)
