tests: ensure Widget Config initialized properly

The following classes required a non-empty collection:
* `CardAnalysisWidgetConfig`
* `DeckPickerWidgetConfig`

Previously this was not handled in tests, and instead a
second call to `initializeUIComponents` was made

To fix this:

* define `initTask` and check for completion in tests
