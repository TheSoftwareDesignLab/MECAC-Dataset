feat: Enable developer option for "Find and replace" browser dialog

Added as a developer option for now.

Provides a dialog that follows the desktop ui to allow the user to
bulk change their notes. Ui follows the desktop code:

- offers all options that desktop offers
- shows feedback when done with the count of notes changed
- the operation is undoable(from DeckPicker)

If enabled, this option will always(no selection/multi select mode) be present
in the menu.
