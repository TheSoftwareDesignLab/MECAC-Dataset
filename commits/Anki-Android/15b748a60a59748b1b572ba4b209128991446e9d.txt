IntentHandler decides which reviewer is used.

This also cause shortcuts, reminder and widget to use the
IntentHandler instead of directly opening the Reviewer.

I should note that the reminders that were created before this commit
will break when the Reviewer class will be removed. Unless we
specifically keep the Reviewer to cause it to redirect to the new
Reviewer.

Given that the reminder is quite broken anyway, must be redone from
scratch, at this point, I think it's an acceptable loss. Trying to
correct it while the reminder does not work properly will be a
nightmare.

There are still plenty of places in the code that use the previous
reviewer inconditionally. I'm not touching them, because I don't need
them to unblock my sync in reviewer issue

Test: I tested shortcut and deck picker widget. I've not tested
notification as they are quite harder to use
