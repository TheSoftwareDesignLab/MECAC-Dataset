Split majority of AbstractSched into BaseSched

- Mirrors the code layout of the desktop version, where routines like
buryCard(), that are not specific to V2 or V3, are stored in a separate
file. This leaves AbstractSched containing only the methods that will
need to be implemented separately for V3.
- Moves some methods from SchedV2 into BaseSched, as V3 will want to
use them as well for now.
- Some of the routines in BaseSched will only work with a schema upgrade.
For now, SchedV2 overrides these so they continue to work with the
legacy schema.
