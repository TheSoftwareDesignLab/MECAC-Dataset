Add `addFragmentsToBackStack()`
The only previous way to start `Preferences` activity in a specific fragment was to use `getInitialFragment()`

But with it, when going back, the user finishes the activity without going back to the headers fragment

So to allow a expected navigation behavior, `addFragmentsToBackStack` is being added
