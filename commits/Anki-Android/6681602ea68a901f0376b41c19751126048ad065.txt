Avoid collection closed crash in reminders or study options fragment

This shows up in the crash database for people with auto-sync on startup,
that closes the database when it is done, at same time reminder or study
options fragment is still in process of being built.

Simple extract method refactors for the parts that touch
the collection, and we give it one more try

If that doesn't work, we at least don't crash now
