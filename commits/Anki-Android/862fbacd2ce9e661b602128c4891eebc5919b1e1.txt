Add & use HtmlHelpPreference

HtmlHelpPreference is a preference that only provides help. It does not
need a key and it is not selectable. It treats its summary text as HTML
an renders it as such--including links.

This commit implements it and adds it to the top of Custom sync server
preference screen.
