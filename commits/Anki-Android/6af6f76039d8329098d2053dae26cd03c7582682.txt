Implement SensibleSwipeDismissBehavior

SensibleSwipeDismissBehavior is more a fix for the inconsistent behavior
of SwipeDismissBehavior, rather than a custom implementation.
This addresses the following issues:

  * When the snackbar is swiped to the right, its opacity changes,
    but not when swiped to the left;

  * When moving the snackbar to dismiss it, the target distance
    calculation does not take margins into account, which makes the
    snackbar briefly appear stuck near the edge;

  * Any amount of horizontal velocity will dismiss the snackbar,
    which can result in user dismissing the snackbar even though they
    didn't want to;

  * If you drag the snackbar to the right, and then flinging it to the
    left, it will suddenly change course and start moving to the right.
