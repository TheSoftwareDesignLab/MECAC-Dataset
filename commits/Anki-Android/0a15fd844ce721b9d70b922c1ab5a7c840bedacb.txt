[GSoC] Unify gestures with controls (#11647)

* Remove gestures screen and its unused strings
* Refactor some binding methods
     Mainly to help the creation of gesture bindings
* Simplify ViewerCommand
    Remove ViewerCommand.NOTHING because it will be possible to associate gestures directly with a command
    Remove preferenceValue because it isn't necessary anymore
* Organize controls category
    - Build summary with other strings
    - Add a key to it
* Don't allow selecting more than one binding
    It doesn't work and if it did, would probably lead to erratic behaviours
* Make possible to associate gestures with commands
    And fix tests along with it
* Upgrade gestures to bindings
    It follows the same logic of previous `UpdateVolumeButtonsToBindings` since these were gestures as well
    The old upgrade needed to be merged with the new one because `ViewerCommand.fromInt` doesn't exist anymore
    Non parameterized tests are being split into a new file to increase performance and reduce flakiness
