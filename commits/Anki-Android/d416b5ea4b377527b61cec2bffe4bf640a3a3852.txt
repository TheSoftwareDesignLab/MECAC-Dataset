fix(cardbrowser): deck restriction not set

when opening the browser, restrictOnDeck was sometimes set
 AFTER a search had occurred

Therefore the UI showed a deck restriction which wasn't applied

We fix this by setting the restriction in th e ViewModel

there is a small inefficiency, in which we read and write
 the same value from `lastDeckIdRepository`, but this will
 be resolved in further refactorings to the ViewModel
 and is a nearly insignificant performance penalty
