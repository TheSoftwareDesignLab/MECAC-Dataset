hack: opt out of edge-to-edge enforcement

plain and black theme changes are required
for the 'shared decks' activity

If this is true, the edge-to-edge enforcement won't be applied.
But if the window belongs to an app targeting BAKLAVA or above, this attribute is ignored
and the enforcement is applied regardless.

 * I tested each screen in the 'Plain' theme to be sure no edge to edge
  changes were missed
 * Using `fullDebug` to test permissions
