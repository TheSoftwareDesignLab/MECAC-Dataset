Refactor widget configuration and layout for improved deck selection and empty state handling

- Added new string resource `empty_widget` to denote when a widget is empty and requires reconfiguration.
- Enhanced `CardAnalysisWidgetConfig` to automatically display the deck selection dialog upon initialization.
- Refactored `CardAnalysisWidget` to handle empty state visibility, allowing users to reconfigure the widget by clicking the empty state message.
