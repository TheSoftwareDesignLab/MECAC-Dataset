Add all locales currently targeted by crowdin

Not sure why I didn't notice before but we have a lot more languages
enabled than we were importing and allowing.

No not all of them are translated but they were all user requests, and
if we don't put them in the UI, why would a translator bother?

This was primarily in response to a user request for Sorani (Kurdish),
which is now enabled (locale code ckb)
