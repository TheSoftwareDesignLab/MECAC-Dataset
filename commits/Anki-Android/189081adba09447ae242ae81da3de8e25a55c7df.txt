Change tvAudioClip.text

After choosing a audio or video, a preview `[sound:fname]` was shown

This was substituted to the file name because
1. Illegal chars like `[` were not removed from the preview
2. It's more helpful to use the file name as feedback if it's the right file
3. `[sound:videofile]` doesn't make much sense
