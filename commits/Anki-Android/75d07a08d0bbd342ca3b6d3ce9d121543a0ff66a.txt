Add `maxLength="29"` to card browser's menu entry.

If menu item's title can't fit into one line in the screen, it's
truncated. Which makes some menu entry not understandable on small
sceren when user's text size is big.

I counted the number of displayed character in such a truncated field,
it's 29.

This seems like a reasonnable limit anyway for a menu entry title.

If this is accepted, then I'll do the same for every other menu. And
ideally, we should have a linter that ensure that any item's
android:title has the same limit.

Admittedly, it'd be great to be able to also show big string, because
translators won't re-translate quickly, if ever. But that seems to a
surpisingly hard problem.
