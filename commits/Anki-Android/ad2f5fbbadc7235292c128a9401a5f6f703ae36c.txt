lint: trim() usage

`TrimLambda` inspection

https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-main:lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/TrimDetector.kt

The Kotlin standard library `trim()` call takes an optional lambda
 to specify which characters are considered whitespace.

When converting Java code to Kotlin code, the converter will convert
 calls for Java's `s.trim()` into `s.trim() { it <= ' ' }`. This
 preserves the exact semantics of the Java code, but is likely not
 what you want: the default in Kotlin uses a better definition of what
 constitutes a whitespace character (`Char::isWhitespace`) and also
 results in less bytecode at the call-site.
