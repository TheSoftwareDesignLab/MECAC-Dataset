Readability improvements in NavigationDrawerActivity

- Wrap getting current SharedPreferences in a method
- Move applying a night mode change into separate function
- Small reformat of comments and whitespace (automatically done by
  Android Studio).

This is the no-op part refactoring part of PR #5686. I'd like to get it
submitted separately so that the PR itself (when finished) is smaller.
