Text pasted into Note Editor is now plain text by default (#10365)

* Redirected `paste` action to `pasteAsPlainText` action

Now, the pasted text appears plain by default.

This will fix the issue for recent devices, but not for devices running version < M.
Have added a TODO to create code to get plain text as default on older devices.
