Replace the splash screen with a progress indicator in action bar
The splash screen wasn't working very well, and was actually unecessarily making the interface feel slower everytime the collection needed to be opened anyway.
This removes the splash screen entirely, and instead adds a progress indicator to the action bar when the collection is loading, and shows a toast when the external storage is not mounted before closing the app.
