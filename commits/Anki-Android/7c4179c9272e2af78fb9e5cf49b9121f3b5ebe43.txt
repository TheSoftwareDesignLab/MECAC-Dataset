feat: use Noto Sans Mono font for type-in-answer

The Noto font family is intended to cover pratically all characters (https://github.com/notofonts/noto-docs/blob/d4514862ffbd92166df9cc5340da794c7df503df/docs/website/homepage.md)

It wasn't used before for type-in-answer cards because its OFL license isn't directly compatible with GPLv3.

But, since the font is actually an aggregation, not a merge, it can work together with GPLv3. That can be proved based on that:
1. The font is replaceable by any other font and the code will work the same
2. The font can be *removed* and the code will work the same

See the 1.2 FAQ of the OFL license https://openfontlicense.org/ofl-faq/
