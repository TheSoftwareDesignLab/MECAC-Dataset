Avoid answer button display / ease calculation in Preview

* NF: Rename showEaseButtons

to displayAnswerBottomBar

* #5756 - Fix Dynamic Card Preview Crash

Previewing a card currently performs displayAnswerBottomBar which
requires an ease calculation.

The ease calculation depends on the current deck, and is not necessary
in the previewer as we don't show ease buttons, we get a crash as the
scheduler is pointed at the wrong deck, so don't calculate either.

Note: This only fixes the crash, it doesn't touch the root cause:
We rely on libAnki to get cards for previews, which relies on the
current deck for setting certain data.

This information is neither required, nor correct when previewing.

We can't change the scheduler while previewing as we may be previewing
during a review session, which would cause a scheduler reset.
