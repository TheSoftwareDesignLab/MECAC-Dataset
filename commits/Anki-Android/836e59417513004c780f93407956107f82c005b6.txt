Change tab layout label casing & active tab indicator

Tab layout is used just under the toolbar in Statistics and Card types.
In Card types, it visually appears as a part of toolbar; in Statistics,
it did not. This makes the two tab layouts use the same style.

  * In Statistics, the background color was set to match the toolbar,
    like it already was in Card types.

  * Inactive tab text was set to slightly transparent white.

  * Active tab indicator was changed to an underline with rounded ends
    that floats just below text. Before it was lurking at the bottom;
    while it looked okay on the light themes, on the black theme it was
    ending up looking too weirdly far from text, as the toolbar and the
    content have the same background color.

  * Tab text is reverted to lowercase
