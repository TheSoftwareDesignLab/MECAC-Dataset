Add consistent padding to Custom study menu items

Each item in Custom study menu may need more than one line,
but the current layout (suitable for single-line items) doesn't give the items a sufficient and consistent padding.

This PR intends to add the sufficient and consistent padding between the items even if each of the items has more than one line.
