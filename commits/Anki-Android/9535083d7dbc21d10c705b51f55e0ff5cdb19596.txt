Fix duplicate check in note editor and removed confirmation dialog

The Note being edited needs to have its first field updated to reflect the current text in the FieldEditText before doing a dupe check, otherwise we are only going to compare the old value.

The confirmation dialog was removed; the field highlighting should suffice to indicate duplicate status.
