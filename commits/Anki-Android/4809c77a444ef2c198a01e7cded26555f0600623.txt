Fix AnkiStatsTaskHandler's AsyncTasks memory leak

- Replaces the strong references to view objects in AsyncTasks with WeakReferences
- Turns the extended AsyncTasks into static inner classes
- Checks if a weakly referenced object isn't null before using. Attempts to update UI only if view objects exist.
