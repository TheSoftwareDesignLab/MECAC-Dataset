Replace "reviewer" by "study screen" in string

Those strings were found by looking for "reviewer" (case insensitive)
in the values folder. And also trying to look at experimental settings
for the new reviewer.

It was decided in
https://github.com/ankitects/anki-manual/issues/341

I must note that changing a string comment don't require a new
translation. So the translators will only have to retranslate the
strings that actually changed.

Also, given how badly "reviewer" was translated in French, (And I
suspect in other language) a new translation will certainly be an
improvement.
