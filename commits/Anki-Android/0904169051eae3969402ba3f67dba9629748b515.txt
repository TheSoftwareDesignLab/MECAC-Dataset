Fix #5141: Release resources on audio completion

Clicking an individual sound file did not abandon audio focus when it
completed playing.

Cause:
We have `playSound` and `playSounds`. We did not set a completion
listener for `playSound`.

Fix:
We fix this by adding a new completion listener, which will call
`releaseSound()` after the optional user callback has completed.
