fix: crash if image dimensions are too large (#15452)

* refactor: invert 'if'

* refactor: extract logic to BackgroundImage

* fix: large bitmap crashes DeckPicker

An image < 10MB can decompress to >100MB, which crashes

Example was: 4 * 4921 * 6983 = 137453372 bytes

This call-stack did not include our code

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Canvas: trying to draw too large(137453372bytes) bitmap.
	at android.graphics.RecordingCanvas.throwIfCannotDraw(RecordingCanvas.java:280)
	at android.graphics.BaseRecordingCanvas.drawBitmap(BaseRecordingCanvas.java:88)
	at android.graphics.drawable.BitmapDrawable.draw(BitmapDrawable.java:548)
	at android.widget.ImageView.onDraw(ImageView.java:1436)
```

Fixes 15450
