fix: restore scroll position after editing card

Previously the scroll position was not reset if the following was true:
`mSearchView == null || mSearchView!!.isIconified`

**Testing**
I was unable to easily test this via unit tests
I had exceeded my timebox, and would use Espresso to add a regression test here
if I had more time

Tested on Google Pixel 3a API 33 emulator
