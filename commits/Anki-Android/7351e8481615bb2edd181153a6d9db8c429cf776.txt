fix: make undo icon in menus to be RTL compliant.

+ Added new RtlCompliantActionProvider

Menu items by default use `ActionMenuItemView` when the they should show as an action. `ActionMenuItemView` is based on a `TextView` not an `ImageView` and I think this is the reason why it does ignore the `autoMirror` attribute set on the passed `Drawable`.

The issue about the menu item APIs is most of them are hidden and have `@RestrictTo(LIBRARY_GROUP_PREFIX)`. So implementing a new `ActionProvider` was the only option. and due to the hidden APIs some things needed to be done differently

For example `item.setEnabled(boolean);` won't actually set the action view and change its enabled property, so it you must also call `item.getActionView().setEnabled(boolean);` to also change the action view enabled status.

There maybe a better way but I have searched in the SDK source code and all the classes/interfaces they use is hidden.
