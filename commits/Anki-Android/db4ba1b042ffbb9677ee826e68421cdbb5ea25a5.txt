feat: Add public interface for Decks.java

We want to move away from relying on the concrete implementation
so we can provide a V16 implementation which uses its own table
rather than loading from the json in the `col` table

This is the first step in defining the methods that we currently use
so we can ensure that both implementations match

JvmOverload methods were defined manually
as the annotation can't be added to an abstract method

Some methods were pulled into the base class
