Lint odyssey (#17292)

* lint: remove never-used edit text selector + related lint ignore

this was slated to be part of CSV/TSV import but it appears it was
never integrated and used in the PR final form, there are zero references
to this drawable in the code base

* lint: remove vestigial lint ignore for integrated resource

the related PR is integrated, the resource is used

* lint: the API project no longer has problems with unknown issue ids

best not to ignore things if we do not have to

* lint: ExportedContentReceiver - widget permission receiver should be internal

it is only used internally and only used in one place

to make it internal you also have to specifically scope the calling intent
to the desired receiver so that it is not an implicit launch

* lint: we export our card content provider on purpose, ignore specific lint

this one has been examined and is on purpose, disable the general lint ignore
for the ExportedContentProvider but specifically ignore this one

* lint: protect our boot broadcast receiver from intent spoofing

* lint: our imports are no longer suspicious

Android.R in particular is suspicious and should only be used fully-qualified

* lint: fix retrieval of themed color, partial fix of RestrictedApi lint

* lint: stop ignoring a pile of lint issues that we no longer trigger

this is not exhaustive these were just some obvious ones I tried

* lint: re-enable ellipses checking, but with prompt to use crowdin for fix

just disabling it was lazy, and a big pile of ellipses crept in
they are easy to fix on crowdin and I did so, we should re-enable this

* refactor: rename jetbrains annotations dep to be unambiguous

how many annotations libraries do we have? lots, so the bare name was confusing

* build(deps): use updated jetbrains annotations in resolutionStrategy

this had gone stale because it was hard-referenced here instead of using libs.versions.toml

Confirmed via `./gradlew :AnkiDroid:dependences`::
- without this, things did not resolve, was mix of "failed", "13" and "23" etc
- before the change, was correctly resolving to 24ish like we were forcing
- after the change, is correctly resolving to 26.0.1 which is our dependabot version / current

* lint: Timber - throwable should be first argument in log call

* lint: timber - incorrect argument count for format string

* lint: timber - incorrect format string type

* lint: timber - use string format instead of concatenation

fixed this by just reducing the wall of text to a one-liner
