Add VersatileTextPreference

At the time being, it serves two purposes:

  * It supports changing input type via android:inputType XML
    attribute, which can help the keyboard app with choosing a more
    suitable keyboard layout.

  * If continuousValidator is set, it is used to prevent the user from
    entering invalid data. On each text change, the validator is run;
    if it throws, the Ok button gets disabled.

It was designed as a drop-in replacement of EditTextPreference with the
extra functionality disabled by default. Additional functionality can be
added as needed.
