Remove Ability to "Change Deck" to Dynamic Deck

* NF: Extract getValidDecksForChangeDeck()

We want to target this function for change and it's the best abstraction
to take without large code changes

* Disable selecting dynamic decks in "Change Deck"

Just contains the UI logic fix, Anki Desktop doesn't support the
operation

* Add check to block transfer to dynamic deck

Anki Desktop does not allow this. We already block it in the UI, but add
an additional check in-case there's a race condition in the UI logic

* NF: Add attributes to Decks

* Add failure to transfer deck task

This ensures that the task can't be provided with an invalid deckId

We fix two bugs:

* A Dynamic Deck is supplied
* A Deck which doesn't exist is supplied (moving the cards to the
default)

* Fix regression in CardBrowser selection

We now use getValidDecksForChangeDeck to display the items, so we need
this to correctly map from the index back to the selected deck

* NF: Codacy Scoping Fix
