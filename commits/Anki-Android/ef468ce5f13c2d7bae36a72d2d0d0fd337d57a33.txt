Improve card analysis widget's configuration activity

Mostly changes the UI and the UX for the configuration activity:

- the widget only allows selecting one deck so the UI was changed from
  a one row list to a single centered card containing the selected deck
  and a button to change it
- asking the user if he wants to discard changes was dropped, it doesn't
  make sense for such a small reversible change
- saving to preferences is done whenever the user changes the selected
  deck, the user can leave the activity both by clicking 'Done' and using
  BACK(the widget handles a "no deck selected" state)
- added progress indicator when querying the collection/ first fetching of data
- added relevant tests
- handle configuration changes for this activity
