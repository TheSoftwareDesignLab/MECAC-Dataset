Issue 8602, Remove Dead Code from startActivityForResult Migration

- Removed the IFieldController::onActivityResult function. All the controllers that implemented the interface now just had a do-nothing impl for it since the migration over to using the register for activity result API.
- The onActivityResult override in MultimediaEditFieldActivity is no longer needed now either after the migration.
