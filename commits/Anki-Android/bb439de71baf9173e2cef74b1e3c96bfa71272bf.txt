8602 - Finished fully migrating DeckPicker over to using registerForActivityResults API instead of the deprecated startActivityForResult (#14818)

* - finished fully migrating DeckPicker over to using registerForActivityResult API instead of the deprecated startActivityForResult
-- removed the last remaining request code dependencies in DeckPicker (PICK_APKG_FILE, PICK_CSV_FILE), and replaced with their equivalent ActivityResultLaunchers
-- removed deprecated onActivityResult function from DeckPicker
-- ImportFileSelectionFragment.openImportFilePicker needed a way to grab the ActivityResultLauncher from the activity, so I created 2 interfaces fetch the launcher, one for APKG imports and one for CSV imports.
-- Created ImportFileType enum to signal to ImportFileSelectionFragment.openImportFilePicker which launcher it should look for

* PR Review Updates:

ImportFileSelectionFragment
- changed multiple parameters flag back to false by default
- changed interface names for more concision and clarity
- added error logging if activity can't handle a particular import
- removed aggregate interface, FileImportResultLauncherHolder

DatabaseErrorDialog
- removed redundant type check
- fixed safe cast syntax typo

DeckPicker
- Aggregate interface FileImportResultLauncherHolder was removed, instead implementing ApkgImportResultLauncherProvider and CsvImportResultLauncherProvider separately
