Fix permission handling in Multimedia editor

* NF: Extract Permissions to Class
* Ensure we have permissions before audio recording

We can get to the AudioView screen from the pronunciation screen,
this is a one-way transition, and should succeed, even if we can't
use the screen to record audio.

* NF: Extract method: performPermissionRequest
* NF: Extract method: setupUIController
* MultimediaEditor: Delay changing field
* Multimedia: Only rerender on permission success

Previously, we would get into a loop of asking for permissions if
the user ticked "deny & remember".

Now we close the dialog and cancel the activity.

We now only try and redraw if we were successful.

Fixes #5407

* Multimedia: Stop second permission check

If we went through the permission check once, we don't need to go
through it again

* Multimedia: Only kill previous UI if successful

Previously, onLostFocus would kill the previous activity. If we fail
navigation due to permissions, then we had nowhere to go

Now, we only perform this if we have permission and can create a
field controller
