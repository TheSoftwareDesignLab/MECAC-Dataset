fix(filtered-decks): [API33+] rebuild after 'back' press

On API 33+, onKeyDown(KEY_BACK) was no longer fired, so
tryCloseWithResult was not called

onKeyDown(KEY_BACK) was still called on API 32

To fix this, add API 33+ specific code to handle the
 Android back button/swipe gestures

We won't keep the activity around forever, so it wasn't worthwhile
rewriting it
