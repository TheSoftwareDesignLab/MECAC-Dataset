feat: add AudioRecordView

based on https://github.com/varunjohn/Audio-Recording-Animation (licensed under Apache 2.0)

It's a view similar to audio recorder present in messenger apps like Whatsapp and Telegram

This GIF from the original library shows it well:

Main functionality differences from the library:
- it restores its state after configuration changes
- `Slide to cancel` fades out after getting near its limit
- Removed the `Delete` animation
- Changed the recording display
- Added haptic feedback when long pressing audio recorder

The View could still be better factored. I already simplified a lot of things, but refactoring it further would lead to decreasing returns. Specially in a complex View with a bunch of animations like this one.

A TODO is to deal with the `Safe display mode` setting, which would require a lot of work here, so I'm leaving the task to a future issue.
