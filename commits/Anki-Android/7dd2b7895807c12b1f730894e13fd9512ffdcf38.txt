Consider scrolling with 0 cards.

The first stack trace of #8821 can only be obtained if there is no item to display and if the first item to display is
item 0.

I have no idea how this can occur, it seems not to have any meaning to scroll to display 0 elements. But if the browser
is closed, I guess it's technically true. Normally, in ths case, the scrolling should not have been triggered in the
first place, but if we need to deal with it, this commit accept this nonsense.
