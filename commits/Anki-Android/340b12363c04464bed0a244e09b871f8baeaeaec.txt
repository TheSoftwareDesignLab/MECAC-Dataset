Refactoring and time precision fix

Moved all deck-related code from Ankidroid to a the new class
DeckThread. This class employs a separate thread for deck operations and
uses a callback mechanism to allow ui operations in Ankidroid.

Data types for time entries in the database changed from single to
double precision floating point numbers. Single precision was not
enough.
