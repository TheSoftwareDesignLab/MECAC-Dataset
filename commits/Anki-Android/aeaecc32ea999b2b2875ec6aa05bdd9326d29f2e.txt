Add basic material theming for snackbars

This changes the parent themes to Material Bridge themes, and adds the
necessary attributes to style snackbars. The colors for the action
button are not exactly right since current themes misuse colors a bit.

From the tutorial:

  Bridge themes inherit from AppCompat themes, but also define the new
  Material Components theme attributes for you. If you use a bridge
  theme, you can start using Material Design components without changing
  your app theme.
