Implement Right-Click Support for Long Click Listeners

-Added right-click support for all existing long click listeners.
-Created an OnContextAndLongClickListener interface to handle both context click and long click events consistently.
 -This interface includes an onAction method to define the common action (context and long click).
 -The interface ensures that both listeners are set without duplicating code.
-Applied the OnContextAndLongClickListener interface to handle right-click and long-click events uniformly.
