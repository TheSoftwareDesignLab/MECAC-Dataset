Makes StudyOptions a singleTask activity.

This has a number of consequences:
- Avoids multiple instances of the activity to stack on top of each
  other, possibly with some other activities in between, making the back
  button not work as expected.
- Allows the activity to handle onNewIntent requests, e.g., from the
  widget or the download manager when requesting a specific deck to be
  opened.
- Clears any activity on top of the study options when resuming the
  activity: this is good and bad; it is good because it gives a
  consistent behavior (which can be customized in the preferences) when
  opening the application; however, it means that the app is not resumed
  to its current state and any activity on top of the existing study
  options will be closed.
