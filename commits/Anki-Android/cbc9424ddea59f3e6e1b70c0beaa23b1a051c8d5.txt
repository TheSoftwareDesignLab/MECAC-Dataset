feat: new reviewer actions configuration

Compared to the legacy reviewer, it:
- Allows to reorder actions
- Has a preview in the settings screen of how the menu looks
- It is easier to setup with drag and drop gestures
- Allows to scroll the `Always show` actions instead of hiding them if the user set many of them
