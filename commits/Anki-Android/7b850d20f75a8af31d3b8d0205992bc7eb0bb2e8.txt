Migrate MaterialDialog to AlertDialog in ModelFieldEditorTest

Note: showing the dialog required an app compat theme so I inserted it
by using one of our themes through a ContextWrapper. The button
declaration also requires either a resource string or a text so the empty
string satisfies this requirement.
