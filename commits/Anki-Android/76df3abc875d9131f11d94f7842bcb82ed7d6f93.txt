feat(new reviewer): tap gestures

Implements tap gestures in the new reviewer. Swipe gestures will be implemented later.

The tap detection is done in JavaScript so we can avoid triggering the gesture when tapping buttons, links, etc

The `isLink` method was shared by Damien (I can't find the original link) https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/14303#issuecomment-1693696444

Only the `9 point touch mode` is supported because I think that the 4 points mode became unnecessary after the interactable gesture selection

For checking if the view is being scrolled, the only way I found was by using `WebView.onScrollChanged`. The old reviewer also uses that, and that's where I got the 300ms timeout to reset `isScrolling`
