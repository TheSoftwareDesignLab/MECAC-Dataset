fix: "Undo" tooltip doesn't show its target

Even when Undo is available (i.e., Undo has its target),
the undo action's tooltip just shows "Undo"
in contrast to the label in the overflow menu:

e.g.,
- Undo Answer Card
- Undo Bury
- Undo Change Deck
- Undo Update Note
and "Undo Stroke" on whiteboard mode

This PR aims to fix the inconsistency.
