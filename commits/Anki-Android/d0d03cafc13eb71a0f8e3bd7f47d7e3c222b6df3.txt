feat(card-browser): support many columns

We introduce BrowserColumnSelectionFragment: a full screen
dialog which allows a user to select and reorder the available
columns in the Browse window

There are two headings: 'active' & 'available'
Headings are implemented as RecyclerView items, so dragging
feels natural. Headings may not be dragged.

It has two primary functions:
* Drag to reorder
* +/- to quickly add/remove from 'active'

A 'preview' is obtained from the first row of the Browse window
If there are no rows, there is no preview
