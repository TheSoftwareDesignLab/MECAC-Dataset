fix(custom-study): defer loading of 'customStudyDefaults'

Speeds up dialog appearance

This takes > 100ms on my phone, and was reported to take >1s on larger collections

* load 'defaults' async
  * if it loads before we build the initial dialog, no change
  * if it loads after the initial dialog,
   if appropriate, update the UI to disable 'increase limit' options
* if a 'increase limit' option is clicked
  * wait for defaults to load, and inform the user if unavailable

Tested with delay(5_000) inside loadCustomStudyDefaults
