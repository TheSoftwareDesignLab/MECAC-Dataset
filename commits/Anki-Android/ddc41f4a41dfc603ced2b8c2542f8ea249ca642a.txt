Switch to using a standard layout in HelpDialog

The combination of a dialog + nested fragments + scrollable layout(ListView)
was breaking the appearance(had to scroll) in several languages(like german)
for the HelpDialog.

The previous ListView was replaced with manually added views, this is safe
as the dialog shows a limited known amount of children.
