BugFix: Safe Display - Don't block nav drawer

For now, the handling of blocking the animation was buggy, so keep showing
animations even if Safe Display Mode is on.

Tapping on the left side of the navigation drawer caused it to partially pop
out, closing it made the entire UI unresponsive.

I had a few tries, but both of these meant that the drawer closed immediately
when it was swiped open.

We might need to copy the navigation drawer code and recode it.
