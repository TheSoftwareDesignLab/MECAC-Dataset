Refactor themes

First, on constants.xml and PreferenceUpgradeService.kt, the day and night theme become equal to the app theme ones,
so the code can be simplified

Most of the changes are about using currentTheme to handle theme operations

disableXiaomiForceDarkMode isn't necessary after `setTheme` or `setThemeLegacy` because is already called on AnkiActivity onCreate()

themeFollowsSystem can be simplified because it needs the applicationContext to get preferences reliably, so it can be called without the context param

On AnkiDroidApp.java, currentTheme value is loaded on app creation (it's set only when a activity is created, so no problems here)

On AnkiActivity.java and Preferences.kt, order of operations are changed to only reload themes if it has been changed indeed in order to avoid the performance costs.

Finally, use currentTheme and currentTheme.isDark instead of sharedPrefs("invertedColors") on:
- AbstractFlashCardViewer.kt
- CustomMaterialTapTargetPromptBuilder
- Reviewer
- ReviewerNoParam
- Whiteboard
- CardAppearance
- HtmlGenerator
- CardHtml.kt
