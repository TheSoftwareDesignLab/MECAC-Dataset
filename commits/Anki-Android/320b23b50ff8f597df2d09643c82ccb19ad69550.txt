* Un-removed [zwnbs](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/feff/index.htm) in translations (fixed at Crowdin instead), undid changes to XML-version of the tutorial.
* Use Html &hellip;, a few contractions it the  asset tutorial.
* Changed a number formating we came along from English to local.  (I checked other use of Locale, they seem to be OK.)
* Fixed a typo in a comment i wrote.
* Say "touch" (which is used in the Android docs), not "click" in the tutorial, refer to the ⊕ button to get shared decks, mention "learnig" cards.
* Also use "touch" rather then "click" or "tap" elsewhere. I hand wondered which one, tap or click, was the right one. According to the Android docks apparently none of those two.
* Say "buried" again in one text
* Added a few question marks to dialog questions.
* Shortened a button text
* Use "acknowledge" internally when we show that something has happend (XX done OK),  to distinguish from the concept of confirmation (Should we XX?).
