Implement AbstractSched as root of Sched[V2] hierarchy

* Set some methods to private

There is actually two reasons to set `removeLrn` and `_revForDeck` to
private.

First reason is that those methods are not called anywhere except in
the class where they are defined. So we can do it without loosing
anything.

The second is that `removeLrn()` and `_revForDeck(long, int)` are not
implemented again in SchedV2. Which means that the type of SchedV2
states that there are public methods `removeLrn()` and
`_revForDeck(long, int)`, while in fact those methods should NOT be
used. Indeed, those inherited methods refere to private variable of
Sched, which are never changed, and ignore the private variables of
SchedV2 with the same name. This would lead to quite non-sensical bug
if for some reason thoses methods were one day used with SchedV2.

Furthermore, once this change is done, it helps create the change
which will occur in the next commit.

* Create AbstractSched class

In Python, SchedV2 does not inherits from Sched. There is no reason
for it to be the case in Java. Since every single methods are
implemented again in SchedV2, even if they are identical (as in
Python), this inheritance makes no sens at all.

The only reason for the inheritance to be used here, I believe, is
that it allows to uses the type «Sched» for variable, whatever
scheduler we use.

The correct java way to do this is to have an abstract class or an
interface, inherited by the two classes. So this is what this commit
does.

Actually, the subclass DeckDueTreeNode is used by both Schedulers,
even if it was declared in Sched.java. In order to be consistent, I
did move it to the AbstractSched class.

* correcting sched v2 name

Now name is as in Anki. Which really does not matter since it's not
used anywhere in the code; neither in anki nor in ankidroid
