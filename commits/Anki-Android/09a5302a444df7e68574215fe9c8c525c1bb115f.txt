chore: exclude non-'values' translation files

Example: 'values-af'

* This removes them from the search/index
* This marks them in the IDE in a different color,
  making it less likely a new user will modify them
  * Files also now contain IDE errors

We go against JetBrains advice as we want these files in Gradle:

> Items you may want to exclude from sharing:
>
> .iml files and .idea/modules.xml file for the Gradle or Maven based
> projects since these files will be generated on import

Tested and languages are still switchable

I did test `Editor > File Types > Ignored files and folders`
This removes the files from the IDE completely
but I could not find a way to share this with other team members
