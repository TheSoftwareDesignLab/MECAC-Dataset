fix[stats] start at "Overview" tab in RTL mode

This is disappointing: there is a bug in TaLayout which means that
selecting index[0] before the control has been laid out will position
the control at LEFT, rather than START (effective result,
not actual code)

Fix this by detecting the layout event for the control, and then
selecting the tab: this uses a scroll animation, which works
