fix: reload media tags when note is edited in new study screen

Replay media functionality now correctly updates after editing a note.
Previously, when a note was edited (adding/removing audio files), the
replay media action would play stale cached media instead of the updated
content. This happened because CardMediaPlayer's media tags were not
reloaded when note text changed.

The fix adds cardMediaPlayer.loadCardAvTags(card) to the opExecuted()
method when changes.noteText is detected, ensuring both visual content
and media player stay synchronized after note edits.
