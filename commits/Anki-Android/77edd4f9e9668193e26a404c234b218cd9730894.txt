Increase menu icon horizontal padding & change tint color

For all themes besides plain, the new tint color follows what Android
colors popup icons by default. For the plain theme, toolbar color is
used. I am not entirely a fan of these colors; perhaps simply
using text color would look better.

A note on the previous approach.

* It seems that instead of using menu.nonActionItems, previously the
  code was checking whether the items appear on toolbar or in the
  overflow popup by looking at

      mToolbar.findViewById<View>(menuItem.itemId) == null

  This is problematic as this can be only reliably run in onMenuOpened,
  which is only run when a menu is opened (duh), but is *not* run when a
  manu is changed. So when the menu is open and you e.g. enable
  whiteboard, which changes the menu, you can observe that the icons
  briefly go white as the menu is recreated but onMenuOpened is not run.

* Relying on findViewById also leads to another issue. When the menu is
  recreated, you want to tint the overflow items. However, at the time
  when onCreateOptionsMenu is called, the views are in the old state.
  Normally this is not an issue, but if you e.g. enable the whiteboard,
  some menu items can “move” from the overflow menu to toolbar or back,
  and for those items the result of the findViewById check will be
  wrong.

  I am not entirely sure, but I think this is the reason for the
  previous code overriding onPanelClosed. This would call
  refreshActionBar after delay, which would recreate the menu again,
  now with the views ready, which would rectify the issue.

Relying on menu.flagActionItems() seems to be solving both issues.
