refactor: prepare AnkiDroidApp, widget, and day-rollover for review reminders

GSoC 2025: Review Reminders

- Annotated parts of AnkiDroidApp that can be removed after review reminders are implemented
- Deleted a `BootService.onReceive` call in AnkiDroidApp that does nothing since BootService filters out all intents without the proper system-level intent
- Wrapped the `observeForever` pathway that allows the widget to trigger notifications via AnkiDroidApp with a `Prefs.newReviewRemindersEnabled` to mark that it can be deleted once review reminders are stable; this includes moving old legacy notifications code within WidgetStatus into proper conditional gates
- Added a docstring to BootService describing possible battery optimization problems as requested by David
- Added some comments to NavigationDrawerActivity to explain what I found to be a confusing call to `setupNotificationChannels`: I almost deleted this line, thinking it was useless
- Gated a `scheduleNotification` call that fires when the start-of-day value is changed to only run when the new review reminders system is disabled, as the new system does not need to worry about rollover time
