improvement(browse): re-implement fast scrolling

Cause: 16620 (da72986f354022cb1ac3cc6245a81c2994e512b9) changed from a ListView to a RecyclerView and scrollbars
were not included

NOTE: commit message is incorrect due to a bad fixup

====
Fix

I could not get `fastScrollEnabled` to work, and only
a visual indicator was insufficient

`recycler-fast-scroll` [Apache 2.0] was unmaintained
but seemed like a reasonable solution.
So it was vendored, refactored and used

Fixes 17786

=====

I tried `com.simplecityapps.recyclerview_fastscroll.views`
* Rendering was slow
* But it extended RecyclerView, rather than needing another
 View
