test: tablet layout is based on xlarge not sw600dp values overlay

this tablet-detection test started failing on newer/larger emulators
that I'm probing locally, and it appears the root cause is that our
tablet layout is triggered by the xlarge resource configuration but
the test utility was based sw600dp resource configuration overlay

The lack of fidelity resulted in test failures locally
