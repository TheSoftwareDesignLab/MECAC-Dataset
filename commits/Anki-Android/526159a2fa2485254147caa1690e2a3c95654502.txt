NF: transform object to data object

As requested by David in a recent PR adding enum in consts.
I looked for all obejcts in sealed class/interface. I didn't touch
object, even if named, that are not part of a sealed class/interface,
as it's not clear that it's a big deal if `toString` does not show
their name.
