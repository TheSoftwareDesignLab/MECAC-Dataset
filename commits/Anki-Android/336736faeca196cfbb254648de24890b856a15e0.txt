NoteEditor intent creation using NoteEditorLauncher interface

Refactored NoteEditor integration with NoteEditorLauncher interface to centralize configuration for various entry points.

Introduced NoteEditorLauncher as a sealed interface to streamline and unify configurations for opening NoteEditor from different contexts. Provides clear and standardized methods (e.g., AddNote, EditCard) for invoking NoteEditor with specific behaviors and data, improving code clarity and reducing potential errors in bundle creation. Promotes modularization by consolidating NoteEditor-related logic into a single location (noteeditor folder), enhancing maintainability and reducing redundancy across fragments and activities.
