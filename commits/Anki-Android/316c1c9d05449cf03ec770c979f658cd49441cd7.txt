improvement: upgrade double tap time interval to a SliderPreference

Which is easier to setup.

Included changes:
- Maximum time was reduced from 2000ms to 1000ms
- The `stepSize` is 10ms to make it easier to setup
- `(milisseconds)` was removed from the title because the display already show that the unit is ms
    - Only did that in the English translation because I don't think that it is worth to remove all the other translations just for that.
