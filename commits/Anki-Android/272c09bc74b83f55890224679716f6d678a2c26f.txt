Remove AnkiActivity.finish deprecation

The sole purpose of the deprecation is to force to use `finishWithAnimation` our `finishWithoutAnimation`, methods which create the possibility of disabling the animations on E-ink devices

But this didn't block uses of `requireActivity().finish()` or `(x as Activity).finish()`, so the animations would show regardless of the E-ink setting

Removing the deprecation and setting it to use the default animation fixes the problem while keeping `finish()` default behavior
