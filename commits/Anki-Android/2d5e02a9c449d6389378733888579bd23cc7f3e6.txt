Accessibility of expander indicated

Ideally, I'd like just to delete the expender when it is not necessary. However, the same expender may be used for
different before and after collapse, so it must keep existing (or be added again, which is hard).
Instead, indicating that it is not required for accessibility, but here only for UI is okay
