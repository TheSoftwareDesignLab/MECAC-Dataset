Remove a couple of TODOs from CollectionManager

- I think suspendable blocks/locking is a bad idea. This was discussed
briefly on https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/13886#issuecomment-1553554314,
and probably belongs in an issue for discussion instead of a todo comment.
- withQueue is private, so users only need to be concerned with maintaining
invariants when they're editing that file, and outside callers get a safe
interface.
