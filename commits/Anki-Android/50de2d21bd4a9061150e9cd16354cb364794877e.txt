Improve "Sync Conflict" UX

Instead of using "Upload" or "Download", use "AnkiDroid"/"AnkiWeb"

This doesn't take into account custom sync servers, but it's a
price worth paying

And have the call to action request what to keep

Don't use "sync conflict" as it's techy

Use small sentences to ensure attention

We change the suggested wording from the site from:
"your decks differ and can't be combined"
to
"your decks can't be combined"

We use a new title for the confirmation screen as we show the
opposite on the follow-up:
"Which do you want to keep? AnkiDroid ->
Overwrite Decks -> Confirm overwrite AnkiWeb"
