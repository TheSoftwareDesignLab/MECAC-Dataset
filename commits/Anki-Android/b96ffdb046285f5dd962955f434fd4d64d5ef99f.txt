Add Mathjax support. (#5285)

* Add Mathjax support.

This adds Mathjax 2.7.0.  It modifies several files in libanki, but I
tried to check them against the originals in Python.

It does not add fading like Anki but rather shows the text as soon
as Mathjax says it is finished.

I have added a few tests.  Some are ported from Anki, and other are
original.

This particular commit does not actually add the Mathjax files.  These
are in the next commit.

* Import Mathjax 2.7.0.

This is an import from the upstream git repository, checked out at the
2.7.0 tag.

* Address PR feedback.

* fix release build OOM w/gradle heap increase

* Use mathjax folder from upstream
