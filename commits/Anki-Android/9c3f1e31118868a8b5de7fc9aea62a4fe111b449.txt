fix: unexpected reviewer highlights with keyboard

* The Reviewer window was fully highlighted if using the keyboard to
answer a card using 'space'

We use `android:colorControlHighlight` to remove this

Briefly tested and I saw no UI regressions, but this is high
risk for UI regressions

Also tested in dark mode
