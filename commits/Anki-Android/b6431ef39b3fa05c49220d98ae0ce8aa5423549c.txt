feat: Dialog to handle gesture selection

GestureSelectionDialogBuilder is the main entry point,
A screen with visual feedback allowing gesture selection via
either user action, or via a spinner

The spinner exists to enhance discoverability
of long/double tap gestures

Known Issues:
* Swipe does not appear on <= API 24. A static image is used
* Gesture unicode character not rendered on <= API 22
* Milliseconds of visual latency on taps (due to double tap checking)
