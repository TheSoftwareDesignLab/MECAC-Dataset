fix(widgets): Unexpected action received: ...ACTION_UPDATE_WIDGET

`Unexpected action received: com.ichi2.widget.deckpicker.DeckPickerWidget.com.ichi2.widget.ACTION_UPDATE_WIDGET`

ACTION should not contain the class name of the receiver, it should be a constant

`Intent.ACTION_VIEW = android.intent.action.VIEW`
