Solved a bug introduced before about the content. Answer field won't expand itself more than two lines. Max and min size are now lower than before. Also the string with the answer of the user may content newlines, and now these are replaced by <br> so that they can be matched against the <br> of the correct answer. The bad part of this is that sometimes, if the amount of newlines don't match, some <br> can be shown as plain text. We'll have to figure out how to solve this, but not now :)
