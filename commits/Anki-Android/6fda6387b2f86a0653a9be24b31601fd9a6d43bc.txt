Fix "AnkiDroid directory is inaccessible" Bug

Fixes #5097, #5510
Partially Addresses #5346 (option can still be set if somehow
preferences is the first entered screen, but I think that's
logically impossible)

This bug has been pervasive for some time, and I logically believe that
this change fixes it, although I haven't verified this empirically.

A user accessing "Advanced Settings" would obtain an error:
directory_inaccessible

This was caused by entering the settings, which set a hardcoded default
value `sdcard/AnkiDroid` without validation which did not match
`getDefaultAnkiDroidDirectory()`

This immediately kicks the user out the app and leaves them in a
crash loop. They don't know what the actual value is meant to be
(as they never saw the UI, so they can't easily fix it)

We fix this by setting the preference when we try to access `deckPath`
