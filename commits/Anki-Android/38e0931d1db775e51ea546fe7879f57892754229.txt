Update deck list rendering

Moved all the decklist building code into the DeckAdapter along with
some refactoring to simplify the process.

Fixes include:
- Hide the default deck when necessary
- Colour filtered decks
- Highlight the current deck
- Correctly focus on the current deck on startup or when it changes
- Improved appearance of dividers between decks
