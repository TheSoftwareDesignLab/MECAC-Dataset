cram->filtered

Currently, from deck picker, you can "create filtered deck" and then "rebuilding cram deck". This is not consistent. If
I believe upstream, you can cram using filtered deck, but there is no notion of "cram deck". Or at least, there is not
such a notion anymore.

In this case, I believe changing the string name is useful, because if in foreign language cram and filtered had been
translated differently, then their translation is not what we actually want.
