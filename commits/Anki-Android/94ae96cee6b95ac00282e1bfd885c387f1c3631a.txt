fix: borders on fullscreen Reviewer

When going fullscreen, the reviewer had white/blue borders rather than
filling the content

Cause:

d0d1eddf6009a34ae3a3e2aa57c1c61ee0dc343b moved to a single xml file for
the navigation drawer, rather than copy/pasting it into each file

Some layouts excluded `android:fitsSystemWindows="true"`, but the new
xml file always included this.

This caused the layout problems

fix: add method: fitsSystemWindows and layout without the variable
