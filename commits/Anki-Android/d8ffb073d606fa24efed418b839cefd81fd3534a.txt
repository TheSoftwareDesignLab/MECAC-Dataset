Remove StudyOptionsListener from StudyOptionsFragment

This listener was invoked only when DeckPicker was in tablet mode(and
StudyOptionsFragment was visible besides the decks list) and when
the "resetDecksList" argument was set to true.

The "resetDecksList" was set to:
- false everytime refreshInterface() was called from outside the
fragment
- true when refreshInterface() was called from inside the fragment,
when unburying a deck or rebuilding/emptying filtered decks

The "resetDecksList" set to true cases were handled by making the
calls undoable to trigger the UI update.
