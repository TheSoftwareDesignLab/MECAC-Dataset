Refactor `AggregateException`, making it translatable, & sligtly fix up the migration failed notification (#13762)

* test: aggregateExceptionStackTrace

Requested? in issue 13667

* AggregateException: Define message + localizedMessage

Requested in issue 13667

* Refactor AggregateException

This also creates concepts of translatable strings and translatable
exceptions.

I decided to drop the logic of former AggregateException.raise, which
would return the one exception from the given list if it only had one
element, or create a new AggregateException, because:

  * the logic is only used in two places, and:

  * in non-trivial cases which involve the creation of translatable
    strings, we'd want to create them lazily as they might not be
    always needed. This might be done, perhaps, with something like
    the following:

        fun getSingleOrAggregateException(
            causes: List<Exception>,
            ifManyCauses: TranslatableAggregateException.MessageBuilder.() -> Unit
        ): Exception {
            require(causes.isNotEmpty()) { "The list of exceptions was empty" }
            return if (causes.size == 1) {
                causes.single()
            } else {
                val messageBuilder = TranslatableAggregateException.MessageBuilder()
                ifManyCauses(messageBuilder)
                TranslatableAggregateException(messageBuilder.message, messageBuilder.translatableMessage, causes)
            }
        }

    I suggest that we do not employ complications like these unless
    AggregateException is extensively used in the codebase.

* Show big, friendly error text in migration failed notification

* Remove multiple-argument `TranslatableString.by`

As discussed in the PR
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/13762#discussion_r1182926595,
this method was not subject to string format linting.

Plus minor renaming.
