Refactor deck selection code in CardBrowser

Uses a simple TextView(and a dropdown drawable at its end) to display
the selected deck instead of the more verbose current Spinner/
DeckSpinnerSelection code.

Note for the different layout:
CardBrowser was showing the deck name + the number of cards in that
deck which was done through the DeckSpinnerSelection related Spinner.
I replaced this(with the exact same behavior) by a deck name TextView +
a subtitle TextView in the new layout.
