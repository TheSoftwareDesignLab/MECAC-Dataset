Bind backup preference UI to backups system implementation

The BackupManager was changed to accomodate for the new preferences
about frequency and the distinct daily/weekly/monthly preferences.

The "backupMax" preference was removed as well, superseeded by the
new backend settings which offer more fine grained options for backups.
