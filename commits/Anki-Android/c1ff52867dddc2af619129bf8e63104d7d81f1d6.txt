fix lint: `ImpliedQuantity`

The quantity 'one' matches more than one specific number in this locale
(1, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 101, 1001, à), but the message did not
include a formatting argument (such as %d).

This is usually an internationalization error.

Renamed reschedule_cards_dialog_title to reschedule_cards_dialog_title_new
* removed reschedule_cards_dialog_title as lint warnings occurred

Issue 10481 - also needs a translation sync
