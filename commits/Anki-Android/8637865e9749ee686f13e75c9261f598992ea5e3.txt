Re-organization of preferences: Extras renamed to new category
"Reviewing", moved there all prefs that affect reviewer behaviour and
look, EXCEPT font related prefs that were moved under "Display". Killed
category "Other", moved remaining prefs there to General. New category
"Performance" under "General". Changed Tibetan preference to more
general "Card Browser and Editor font" now using dynamic setting for
font and looks at fonts directory for available fonts.
