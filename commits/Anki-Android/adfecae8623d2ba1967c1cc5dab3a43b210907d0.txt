fix: 'double tap' when answering using keyboard

We moved to onKeyDown in e439280bf3382a4af4146316f2ada063cce0f8ca
but the 'space' handling logic was in onKeyUp and therefore was still
executed

So move all handling to `onKeyDown`, as the processor handled the action,
super.onKeyDown would not be called
