Discard any extra clicks enqueued before Looper gave us control

Apparently Android can queue clicks if they are fast enough, then
deliver them in a batch once your code starts responding. So it
is not enough to just disable a button as it may have already been
clicked multiple times.

However the UI thread is a single thread, so as we respond to them
we should be able to use the button enabled status itself as an
indicator that we should discard clicks or not
