Sched.java cleanup

- A number of minor changes to variable names, comments, or code layout in order to better match sched.py. Suppressed or resolved some warnings.
- Changed method signatures to match sched.py. It seems we had a custom approach to leech detection which might explain some of the leech bugs we've seen. Leeches will be resolved in a future commit.
- Removed a duplicate loop in the day cutoff check (it did NOT differ from libanki, despite the comment).
