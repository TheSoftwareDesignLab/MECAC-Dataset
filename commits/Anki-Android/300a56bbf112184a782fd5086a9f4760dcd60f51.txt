Fix #15993: Scroll position wrong after editing
When editing a card in the CardBrowser, after scrolling down and
selecting a card at the bottom of the list, the scroll position is
lost when returning to the CardBrowser. This happens because the
scroll returns to an incorrect position after saving the edited card.
To fix this, I now save the position of the first visible item when
clicking on a card (onTap()), and when returning to the CardBrowser
after saving, the scroll is adjusted back to the previously saved
position (onResume()).
