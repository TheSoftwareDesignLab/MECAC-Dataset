Catch some attempts to access UI inside withCol, and col within UI thread

If detected, shows an IDE lint.

- Catches calls to col.* inside AnkiActivity contexts.
- Catches calls to methods of classes derived from AnkiActivity, eg

```
withCol {
  someDeckPickerMethod()
}
```

- UI classes that don't inherit from AnkiActivity are not caught unless
they are also annotated with @UiThread. Eg SetNotetypeListener in
NoteEditor references col, but is not caught without an extra annotation.

It might be best to wait until 2.16 is out (and any quick follow-up
releases to address the inevitable regressions) before we start addressing
these issues in bulk; for now the code might be better left as-is unless
it's to address a known bug someone has reported.
