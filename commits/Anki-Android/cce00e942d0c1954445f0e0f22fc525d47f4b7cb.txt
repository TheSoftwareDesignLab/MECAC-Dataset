Check for null deck while updating widget.

I am not yet sure when this happens, but it seems that sometimes
Deck.openDeck returns null, and currently we crash. Log this as an error
and and use the previous values we had for that deck.

This is workaround for:
  Issue 599: Crash when updating widget in the background.
