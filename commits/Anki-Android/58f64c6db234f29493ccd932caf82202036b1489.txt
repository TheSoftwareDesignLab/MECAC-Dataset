fix: make `RecursivePictureMenu` navigation icon RTL compliant

`autoMirror` don't work with `VectorDrawableCompat`, so I used `AppCompatResources` which should do the exact same thing as `VectorDrawableCompat` as it's supposed to handle all types of drawables.

NOTE: it does work (mirroring) on API 21
