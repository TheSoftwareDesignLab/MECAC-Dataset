refactor [squash]: remove CreateCustomStudySessionListener.kt (#17510)

* refactor: remove hide/showProgressBar

We now have all of these calls in `launchCatchingTask` /
`showProgress`

so an additional progress bar is not necessary

Adds `withProgress { }` for Fragments with
a default 'Processing' string

* refactor: inline CreateCustomStudySessionListener
It's just a callback, so use the interface

* refactor: remove CreateCustomStudySessionListener.kt
Just call the method after it's executed
We're now using coroutines, so a continuation is much simpler

* refactor: remove use of 'decks' outside `withCol`

* refactor: 'cram' to 'dynamicDeck'
We no longer use 'cram'

* docs: dismissAllDialogFragments is required
and can't be this.dismiss() inside the block for now
