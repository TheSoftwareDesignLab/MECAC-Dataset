I've made the following changes:

Added a progress bar during sync(payload&full)
Added the usage of Ruby annotations & font size
Added an option for displaying notification bar
Added a textview displaying current failed, due, new cards(Anki style)
Added a textview displaying deck name on Study Options screen(these changes make displaying a title obsolete)

Its not all perfect (especially progress bars) but I think its an improvement.
