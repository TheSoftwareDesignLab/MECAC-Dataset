Use versionCode to verify system WebView requirement

I used the first stable WebView versionCode that I could find,
corresponding to version 77.0.3865.73.
See https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/android-system-webview/android-system-webview-77-0-3865-73-release/

The code will still display the app version to the user if it's available or
0 otherwise with the dialog's text to be modified in the future.
