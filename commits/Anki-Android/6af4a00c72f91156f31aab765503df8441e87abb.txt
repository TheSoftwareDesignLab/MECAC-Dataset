Add preference: Focus ‘type in answer’

Some users only use the 'type in answer' function occasionally
(for example: checking spelling)

When we added the 'always focus type in answer' functionality,
this was not a good preference for them, as the keyboard uses a lot of
space.

Now, we add in a preference: "Focus ‘type in answer’".

We default this to false, as to not change user expectations

This preference does not make sense if the 'Type answer into the card'
feature is set, so disable it if we use an <input> box.
