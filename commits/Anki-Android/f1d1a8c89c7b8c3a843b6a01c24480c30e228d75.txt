Add new async framework

The previous framework (CollectionTask) had issues leading to complexity:

* Overuse of inheritance
* Combination of Start/Stop/Progress/Cancellation

We use an AnkiTask and AnkiMethod which have 0/1 layer of inheritance
and a fluent interface

AnkiTask/Method is a simple class which provides accessor methods to
the collection and the task progress, this allows a simple method
signature: to override: execute()

The listener builder interface allows for composition of multiple
task listeners
