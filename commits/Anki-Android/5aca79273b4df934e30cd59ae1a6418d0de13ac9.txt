Whiteboard: Continue Drawing if UI is shown

When testing a fix for #5741, it was discovered that showing the
system UI in the whiteboard via a swipe down triggered a gesture.

This was because the whiteboard took focus of the touch events
until the system UI was shown.

When the system UI was shown, drawing was cancelled, and an event where
the system UI was visible started. This caused the gesture listener to
fire.

As the gesture listener is started when the System UI is shown, it
doesn't have context on the true start position of the fling event
, so we can't say that it was from the status bar.

To fix this, we block all gestures in fullscreen when the whiteboard is
shown until the whiteboard has stopped drawing.
