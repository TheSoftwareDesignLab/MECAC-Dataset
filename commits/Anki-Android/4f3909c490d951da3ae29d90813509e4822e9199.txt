Fix bug in deck indentation
Setting R.attr.selectableItemBackground was causing issues with the deck layout for some reason on pre-Kitkat devices. This only uses that drawable on SDK 21+ where the ripple will actually be shown, otherwise we default back to the standard behavior where a deck will be highlighted grey when clicked
Fixes #3664
