Include Edgecases in kotlin migration script + Touch ups

Fix: #11102

Edgecases included:
1. File Renamed instead of deleted+new file
   If the changes made to the file after kotlin conversion
   are not too different, Git's heuristics identifies the
   changelist as a rename directly and "git status" outputs
   "renamed :" instead of "deleted:" + "new file:".
2. Files modified:
   Let the user confirm whether all modified changes are intended.
