Remove launchWithCol()

Code inside a withCol() block should not modify the UI, as it runs on
a background thread. withCol() should fetch and/or mutate collection
data, and then UI operations/program state changes should be performed
outside the withCol block, so they're serialized on the main thread and
the risk of race conditions is minimized. Recently mentioned on
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/13886#issuecomment-1555407973

launchWithCol() makes it a bit too easy to accidentally run UI code in
the background thread, as it provides both an async context and a collection
at the same time, and the user will be tempted to do both fetch-from-col
and update-UI steps inside the block. Removing it means a few extra characters
at each call site, but I think it's a bit less error-prone.
