Uncouple the Exporting dialogs from their hosting activities.

Exporting dialogs don't require their hosting activities to implement interfaces for communication, rather the interface is passed using a constructor dependency.

`FragmentFactory` is used to support building dialogs/fragments with a constructor, and to make sure that when the OS recreate the fragment due to a configuration change (rotation) the fragment will be constructed with the same constructor dependencies again.

Move the responsibility of communicating with dialog entirely to the delegate.
