Remove suspended code from DeckAdapter

The suspended code was removed and a similar implementation was done
in DeckPicker which will now do the necessary work and then will pass the
calculated data to the adapter.

The adapter was changed to extend ListAdapter which uses diff-ing to
observe changes so we get free animations. The filtering was removed
from the adapter, DeckPicker computes the data as it has all info needed,
the query and the deck tree. The adapter becomes dumb and just reacts to
the changes. A bit wasteful to start a coroutine for each change in the
query text, but I wanted to keep the change count small.

Note: the methods findDeckPosition() and getNodeByDid() were moved in
DeckPicker, they are not needed by the adapter and the DeckPicker already
has a reference to the deck tree that it can use in the methods.
