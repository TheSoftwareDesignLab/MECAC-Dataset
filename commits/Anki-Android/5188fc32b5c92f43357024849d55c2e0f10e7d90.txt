Fix #5715: Hide style/script in deck description

Previously, the deck description handled converting most HTML into a
`Spanned`, but instances of the script and style tag displayed their
inner text as a string.

Now, we Regex replace the two tags out of the HTML before we use
Android to convert the string into a `Spanned`.

This removes the tags and their content to provide a better description.
