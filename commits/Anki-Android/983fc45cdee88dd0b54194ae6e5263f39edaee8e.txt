Handle locale name being empty in preferences

The LanguageUtils.appLanguageIsRTL() method, used in preferences to
build the headers, was querying the Locale.displayName property
directly although this can be an empty string.

The method was modified to have it default to false(meaning being a non
RTL language) when the Locale.displayName is not available.
