feat: Permission screen (#14130)

* refactor: add some Permissions utils

* feat!: change text primary disabled color

Use transparency to take account of the text background, so it isn't invisible in gray backgrounds

* feat: PermissionItem

Layout object that can be used to display a permission and get it.

Ideally, it would use material components to deliver a better appearance, but we don't have material themes yet

* feat: PermissionsFragment

* feat: PermissionsUntil29Fragment

* feat: Full30and31PermissionsFragment

* feat: TiramisuPermissionsFragment

* refactor: enumerate permissions and permissions screens

Using an enum to manage permissions has some advantages
- can associate permissions with their screens
- is exhaustive, so all permissions possibilities are known statically
- is parcelable, so it can be passed as an activity extra, or a fragment argument

AnkiDroidFolder is converted to a sealed class in order to handle permissionSets

* feat: PermissionsActivity

Ideally, it would use material components to deliver a better appearance, but we don't have material themes yet

* feat: Enable/disable the permissions screen continue button

if all permissions have been granted

* test: Each screen starts normally and has the same permissions of a PermissionSet

* feat: Request permissions with a permission screen

Simplifies things by not having to handle callbacks or blocking UI elements/background tasks while getting a permission.

Also, it can be easily launched in other screens if necessary, which can avoid crashes like #13518

Additionally, adds a better UI/UX for the user

* refactor: remove unused Permissions files

got unused after permissions started being handled by permission screens

With the new permission screens, the "Please grant AnkiDroid the 'All files access' permission to continue" string isn't necessary anymore

* fix: use compat method in hasAnyOfPermissionsBeenDenied()

* Adopt API34 changes

- activity recreation via ActivityCompat.recreate
- dynamic instantation via getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()
- onBackPressed deprecation + call super

* remove unused string
