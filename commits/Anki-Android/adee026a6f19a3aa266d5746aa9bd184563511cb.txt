NF: _groupChildrenMain simplificitation

This use the fact that _groupChildrenMain is called only after the
deck collection is checked, so there is no duplicate and each nested
deck has a parent.

Currently what occurs is that, if you have the list of deck ["A",
"A::B", "A::C", "A::C::D", "E"], the function will first process the
sublist ["A", "A::B", "A::C", "A::C::D"] and then the sublist
["E"] (this is because it looks only as the first component of the
name)

Then, in the first sublist, it will look for the parent "A" and the
children ["A::B", "A::C", "A::C::D"], by looking at which deck has
depth 0... that is useles, because, thanks to the sorting, we know the
parent exists and is the first element of the list. Therefore, I
removing the condition dealing with the first element of the list and
use the fact that I know that it is the first element.

By itself it should be a really really small improvement. However, it
allows to simplify the code and eventually to add great improvement
into it.
