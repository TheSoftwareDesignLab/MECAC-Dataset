Bump recyclerview to 1.2.0, forward-port deprecated APIs

Previous `getAdapterPosition()` API was split to be non-ambiguous,
and `getBindingAdapterPosition()` seems like the correct option to use between
the two new APIs, as the listener appears to be viewed from the adapter context,
not the RecyclerView context (where `getAbsoluteAdapterPosition()` would be correct)

Additionally, `setHasFixed(true)` must not be used in layouts with wrap_content, as that implies
that the content is not fixed - this is a new lint check. Uses of `setHasFixedSize(true)` have been
removed in these contexts, with the downside being that RecyclerView cannot do some layout performance
optimizations, as it needs to check adapter size now during layout.
