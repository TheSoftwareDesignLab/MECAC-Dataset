i18n sync workflow on ubuntu / bump javascript deps (#15325)

* chore(i18n): switch sync translations workflow to ubuntu from macos

our i18n infrastructure used to rely on some macOS-specific behavior,
but now that it is all javascript I don't think the runner OS actually
matters

if it does not matter, then ubuntu is preferred as macos has limited
concurrency on free accounts

* build(deps, i18n): bump all javascript dependencies

they're all minors and/or patches so nothing special
closes out all the dependabot issues for javascript deps at once
