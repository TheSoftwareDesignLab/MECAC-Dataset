Introduce CollectionManager for preventing concurrent access

Currently there are many instances in the AnkiDroid codebase where
the collection is accessed a) on the UI thread, blocking the UI, and
b) in unsafe ways (eg by checking to see if the collection is open,
and then assuming it will remain open for the rest of a method call.
"Fix full download crashing in new schema case" (159a108dcb) demonstrates
a few of these cases.

This PR is an attempt at addressing those issues. It introduces
a `withCol` function that is intended to be used instead of
CollectionHelper.getCol(). For example, code that previously looked
like:

        val col = CollectionHelper.getInstance().getCol(this)
        val count = col.decks.count()

Can now be used like this:

        val count = withCol { decks.count() }

The block is run on a background thread, and other withCol calls made
in parallel will be queued up and executed sequentially. Because of
the exclusive access, routines can safely close and reopen the
collection inside the block without fear of affecting other callers.

It's not practical to update all the legacy code to use withCol
immediately - too much work is required, and coroutines are not
accessible from Java code. The intention here is that this new path is
gradually bought into. Legacy code can continue calling CollectionHelper.
getCol(), which internally delegates to CollectionManager.

Two caveats to be aware of:
- Legacy callers will wait for other pending operations to complete
before they receive the collection handle, but because they retain it,
subsequent access is not guaranteed to be exclusive.
- Because getCol() and colIsOpen() are often used on the main thread,
they will block the UI if a background operation is already running.
Logging has been added to help diagnose this, eg messages like:

E/CollectionManager: blocked main thread for 2626ms:
    com.ichi2.anki.DeckPicker.onCreateOptionsMenu(DeckPicker.kt:624)

Other changes:

- simplified CoroutineHelpers
- added TR function for accessing translations without a col reference
- onCreateOptionsMenu() needed refactoring to avoid blocking the UI.
- The blocking colIsOpen() call in onPrepareOptionsMenu() had to be
removed. I can not reproduce the issue it reports, and the code checks
for col in onCreateOptionsMenu().
- The subscribers in ChangeManager need to be cleared out at the start
of each test, or two tests are flaky when run with the new schema.
