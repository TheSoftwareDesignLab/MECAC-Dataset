refactor(gestures): generalise 'Screen'

Prep to work on PR 12882 (Previewer Gestures)

Our gesture system was set up to work with the Reviewer
The problem with this is that when we have two screens,
a conflicting gesture between the screens doesn't matter

This extracts the Reviewer from most parts of the gesture
implementation, so we can replace it with the Previewer when
necessary

Note: The Previewer is a special case, other screens won't have
 a concept of a 'CardSide'
