build(deps): bump android gradle plugin to 7.1

- bcprov gradle.properties setting no longer needed, fix released in AGP7.1
- androidx.core resolution strategy no longer needed (actually was in fragment 1.4)
- opt in to api component publishing new regime to quiet warning
- disable certain lints that were not providing value or are already tracked
