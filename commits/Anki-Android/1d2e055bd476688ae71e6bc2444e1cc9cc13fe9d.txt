Added lock on mCard to disallow null

Previously, mCard could temporarily be null when the render process was
being reset. We use a lock to guard against this.

Since we're a reader/writer lock, heavy on the read side, we only block
the UI thread in an exceptional circumstance (when the render process
crashes).
