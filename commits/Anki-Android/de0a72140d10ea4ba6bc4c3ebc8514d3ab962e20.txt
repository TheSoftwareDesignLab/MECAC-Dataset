chore(i18n): remove barely translated languages

These still remain on Crowdin, but were not close to the 100% core translation
 we requested.

I kept languages > 30%

A number were added in a045fdae749767b73953d226b22147370406b77a

but after a few years, they're still not close to 100% of <500 words

This bloats the app size for limited value

Removals:

* yue - Cantonese - 13% of Core translated
* is - Icelandic - 3%
* jv - Javanese - 0%
  * 19% for strings
* ss - Swati - 0%
* sw - Swahili - 0%
* tg - Tajik - 2%

Irish - 12% of Core translated

* [David] I have a few people I can ask ...

  > This seems like a much smaller project. I could get it done pretty soon
  > however, it is definitely harder given the lack of existing translations to approve
