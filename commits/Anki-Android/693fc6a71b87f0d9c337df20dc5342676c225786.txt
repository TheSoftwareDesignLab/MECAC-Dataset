Refactor Preferences fragments initialization

1. Refactor getSubscreenIntent
- So it doesn't depend on the class parent being `com.ichi2.anki.Preferences`

2. Keep saveInstanceSaved on configuration changes (e.g. dark mode) so the activity restores its previous state

3. Remove addFragmentsToBackStack and CustomSyncServer.getSubscreenIntent because are unused
