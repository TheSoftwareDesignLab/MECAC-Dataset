Clean manifest (#5597)

* Add missing tabs
* Adding name as top of xml
    I believe that name (and then label) are the most relevant things you  
    may see in an activity manifest. So I moved it top
* Ending symbol of multiline xml tag on their own line
   When a multiline tag is edited, sometime, there are useless edition in
   git only because it means that the ending symbol has moved. While in
   fact, it could have been on its own line all along. That's why I'm
   doing a single commit with > and /> on their own line, so that future  
   edits are cleaner
* Moving label after name
   I believe label is the second most important thing in a tag. Because
   it's also unique most of the time. So I moved just after name, so that
   on reading a tag, the most important data appears first
