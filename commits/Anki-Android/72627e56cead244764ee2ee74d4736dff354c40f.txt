audio recording: hide 'contents' label if empty

'Field Contents' was designed to make it easier to
 read the content of a note while recording audio

But sometimes a user will want an audio-only note
In this case: the note's fields are all empty, and
 showing the 'Field Contents' heading doesn't make sense
