[GSoC] Add option to import text files (#12072)

* Modify import error string

As text files are going to be accepted as well

* Be able to pass mimeType and requestCode to the import dialog

Before, it always used "*/*" as mime and IMPORT_APKG as requestCode

* Fix getFileNameFromContentProvider nullity

* Extract part of handleContentProviderFile

into getUris(), so it can be reused later

And remove the "Unhandled import from: “%s”" string because it is too similar to "Failed to import file\n\n%s"

"Unable to process import request" too because it didn't give a better message than "Failed to import X"

* Add option to import text files

This just adds the option, not the actual text/csv import implementation

As the CSV importer will require the new backend, the options is only shown if the new backend is enabled

The warning error is temporary, as the actual CSV importer is going to be implemented on a future PR
