Fix Full screen navigation drawer overtaking child view gestures

The option Full screen navigation drawer allows opening the navigation
drawer by swiping right anywhere on the screen. It has an issue in that
it will intercept all rightwards swipes, even if a view inside it also
wants these events. This fixes it.

Closes #11588.
