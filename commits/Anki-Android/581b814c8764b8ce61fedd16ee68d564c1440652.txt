feat(new study screen): make gestures more responsive

Previously, gestures waited for the double tap timeout to confirm that the user did or did not intend to make a double tap

Multi-finger gestures didn't do that because they were considered as always intentional

The first change this commit does is prioritizing detecting swipes as well, considering them as always intentional

The second change is avoid waiting the timeout if the `Double tap` gesture isn't assigned, making single taps more responsive. A second single tap below the double tap timeout is ignored to avoid wrong taps.

If the `Double tap` gesture is enabled, wait for confirmation only with single taps
