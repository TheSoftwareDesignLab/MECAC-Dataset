Fix Crash on Previewing Existing Image

* Fix #5856 - Image Preview Crash

When loading an existing image, we performed the image load before we
had created all elements of the UI. This caused issues.

We fix this by splitting UI creation and initialisation logic

* Fix #5856 - Fix API Errors

createUI has `@SuppressLint("NewApi")` due to camera permissioning,
but it masked a bug in calling setBackground with lower API levels

* Added Unit Tests

Very basic right now, but there's a lot of value in ensuring that a
screen can be created with no errors.
