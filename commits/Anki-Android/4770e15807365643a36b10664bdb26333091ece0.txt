Fixes issue 690: Custom fonts broken in 0.7beta7

It appears that:

https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/Anki-Android/commit/7684fa359c5f51d96156c97c186c4d110d562e75

accidentally removed the font name from the generated CSS.
As a consequence custom fonts (or any fonts) are no longer working since
0.7beta6.

This commit reinstates the font-family in the CSS and therefore fixes
the custom fonts.
