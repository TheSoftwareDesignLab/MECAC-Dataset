fix(strings): missing positional string args

Plurals missing positional string args were previously
 not detected by either lint or AAPT2. A future PR will fix this
 and the code needs to have no issues.

To fix: rename:
`reviewer_window_title_days` -> `reviewer_window_title_days_new`
`reviewer_window_title_hours` -> `reviewer_window_title_hours_new`
and fix the strings: `%d` -> `%1$d`

I renamed the strings as:
* This was easier to do in the IDE, rather than deleting them
* They'll be overwritten on the next translation sync
  * and with less of a 'line change'
