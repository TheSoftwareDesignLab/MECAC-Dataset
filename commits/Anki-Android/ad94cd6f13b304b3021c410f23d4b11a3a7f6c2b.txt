* build, download and extract i18n files
* convert update function to ts
* fix regex, string replacement

* upload, download, update using workflows
* Update sync_translations.yml

fix: market title string upload
create temp dir
* added comments, find broken strings before commit
- added docs
- added return type for functions
- better message for uploading, download, building and downloading
- find broken strings before commit
* add prettier
* add eslint
* remove find broken strings
* wait for zip build on crowdin server
* check broken strings
* use only non positional strings in test
* test string format errors
* check errors for float
* test: remove typescript string format checker and associated jest test
it duplicates android lint at great cost in dev time and run time
* chore: consolidate credential prep workflow steps
* style: `yarn install` is equivalent to `yarn`, just call `yarn`
* perf: avoid shell glob and add whole res folder
the only stages that should be changed are translation ones, so
we can let git do the expansion internally, which will avoid
shell-globbing which can have perf issues and/or fail if it matches
too many files
* style(lint): result of `yarn format` auto-formatting run
* style(lint): buildProgress var never reassigned, use const
* build(deps): result of `yarn upgrade --latest`
* fix: use new crowdin personal access token
this was freshly generated and added to github org under same name
* fix: use official project id
* style: progress output more condensed
* dev: use `tsc --watch` for dev command
this gives us continuous incremental build
* style: use exact header as in current file to minimize diff
we may decide to update this later, but this is important during
i18n sync process change to make sure diff is minimal
* fix: ignore 12-dont-translate files
these do not need to be copied from the zip to the app res directories
* fix: marketing title is created fresh each time
appending without clearing it out means it will grow infinitely
* docs: update comment on language list to match updated python version
this was changed in python while new system was in development,
synchronizing change here
* docs: simple comments on upload process
* add readme
* docs(l10n): expand the readme, reformat, use conventional all-caps README
* fix: ingest PR review feedback, prepare for final merge
- use numerical separator
- update comment about language tags (2- vs 3-letter etc)
- typos and formatting
- mark package as non-publishable ("private")
