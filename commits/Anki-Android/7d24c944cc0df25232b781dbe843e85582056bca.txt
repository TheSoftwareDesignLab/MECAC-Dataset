First version of 'Download Manager'. Currently it does not allow to really resume the downloads where we left them because I suspect the connection to AnkiOnline does not support yet the Range header, but it allows the user to download any number of decks on background. There are still some things to polish, like updating more than one deck on background, putting all this code on a Service or minor UI details.
