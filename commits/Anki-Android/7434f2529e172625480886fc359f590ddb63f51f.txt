feat: scrollbar always visible if content scrolls on about

verified this shows the scrollbar only when the content actually
scrolls, so large phones won't see a useless scrollbar but now small
phones won't have a sometimes-invisible scrollbar exactly when a user
that needs help needs to know they can scroll down for debug info
