feat(reminders): show placeholder for zero review reminders

GSoC 2025: Review Reminders

If there are no review reminders, show a placeholder icon and text which says "You have no review reminders" in ScheduleReminders.

Added a new outline_notifications_off_24 icon for this, obtained from the vector assets library. In adding it to fragment_schedule_reminders, I tried my best to copy the formatting of DeckPicker's XML file (i.e., I used a LinearLayout nested inside a FrameLayout, etc.)

Added two lines to ScheduleReminders's `triggerUIUpdate` to enable the placeholder visual if the adapter is displaying no review reminders.
