move 'Full screen navigation drawer' setting

from 'Controls' to 'General'

It made sense to be in 'Controls', when it was called 'Gestures', there were no key or joystick support, and there were no support for other screens like the previewer.

Now, it feel displaced in the 'Controls' category because it isn't related to any control.

Also, the dependency to 'Enable gestures' is soft, because disabling 'Enable gestures' doesn't remove the full screen navigation drawer behavior.

So, that dependency ends up being unnecessary.
