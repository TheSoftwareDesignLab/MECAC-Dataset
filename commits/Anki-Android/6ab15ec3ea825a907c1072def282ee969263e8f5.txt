feat(tool): format issue/PR links in Discord

Links to the repo are unpleasant to see:

* Link previews are too large & distracting
* Links without a preview give no context

I want something which both gives context, and is compact

`macos-clipboard-to-discord` converts an issue link:
https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/16804

into:
* A link with text: "#16804: refactor/docs: `libs.versions.toml` changelogs/renames"
* Without a preview
* Redirecting to the correct PR

`./format-for-discord` performs this formatting: accepting a PR/Issue number: 16804
and outputting the above to stdout
