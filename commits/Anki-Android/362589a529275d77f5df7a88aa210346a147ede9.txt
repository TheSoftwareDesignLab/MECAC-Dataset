Enhanced Error handling while editSelectedCardsTags

Removed try/catch from doInBackgroundUpdateMultipleNotes which internally suppressed the error. Any exception is handled by launchCatchingTask{}. In case of any error, CardBrowser will not abruptly close now which ensures any edited data is not lost from UI.
