Correctly parse and render cloze fields and nested modifiers

This fixes issues with template rendering when multiple modifiers are present in a single field. Modifier processing now follows the same order as the desktop client and all nested fields are parsed instead of only the first.

Examples that now work:
<cloze:furigana:FieldName>
<type:cloze:FieldName>
<text:cloze:FieldName>
