refactor(libanki): use json delegated properties

This reduces duplication in the 'key', and a common JSON access pattern

To do so, classes needed to be `data class`, rather than `value class`

Since we're only copying an object reference, and we shouldn't be accessing
thousands of these classes, the minor performance hit seems worthwhile
for better code readability
