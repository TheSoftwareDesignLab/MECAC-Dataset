fix(note-editor): restore instance state

Now Note Editor is a fragment, it no longer receives
`android:viewHierarchyState`. This is now handled by the Activity

But, we did not need to handle this manually.
Recreating the fields, with the same `id` value restores the text

----

This fix does not handle the loss of focus for dynamic elements

During testing, this lack of focus coming back from 'Drawing'
was jarring. In Production this will have minimal impact
as the user will have lost context by the time the activity is
restored (a user will not have 'Don't keep activities' on).
