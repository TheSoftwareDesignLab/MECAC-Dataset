Fix onBackPressed() deprecation for CardTemplateBrowserAppearanceEditor

The previous code was showing a discard dialog if there were any
changes, meaning that the user entered something different in the
input boxed than what text was the screen initialized with.

The fix introduces two listeners for the input boxes to use them as a
dynamic listener for when there's change and implicitly could be BACK
changes as well.

The code still shows the discard changes dialog for the UP button in
the toolbar like before.
