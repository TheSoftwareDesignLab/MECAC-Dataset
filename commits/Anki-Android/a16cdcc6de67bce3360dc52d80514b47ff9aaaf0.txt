Revert custom study tag selection to use old tags dialog

Done as a temporary solution to improve the tag selection ux for
custom studying.

TagsDialog was modified to only show the tags for the target deck
when selecting tags for custom studying.

This is a regression in functionality because it only allows the
user to select the tags to include, it doesn't allow the user to
also declare tags to exclude. It also doesn't remember the selection
like using getCustomDefaults() does.
