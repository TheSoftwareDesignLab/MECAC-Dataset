feat(reminders): ReviewReminder schema migration

GSoC 2025: Review Reminders

Added review reminder schema migration handling. If a future developer updates `ReviewReminder`, so long as they also update the schema migration code, data should be transferred safely on all user devices from the old schema to the new system. Without this code, that data transfer would result in SerializationExceptions and IllegalArgumentExceptions.

**Changes, grouped by file:**

ReviewReminder:
- Fixed up a docstring explaining the migration process.
- Made the ReviewReminder class implement the ReviewReminderSchema interface. This allows it to also be stored in the oldReviewReminderSchemasForMigration map. This also means ID now needs to become an override field; see ReviewReminderSchema in ReviewReminderMigrationSettings.

ReviewRemindersDatabase:
- Converted it into an object. There was no need for it to be a class, I was always using `val database = ReviewRemindersDatabase()` everywhere anyways.
- Added a `StoredReviewRemindersMap` data class. This is a wrapper around a serialized map of review reminder IDs to review reminders. Previously, these maps were written to SharedPreferences in single chunks; now, we serialize the map to a string and store it as a part of a `StoredReviewReminderMap`. The `StoredReviewReminderMap` has a version field, which allows us to determine which schema to use to deserialize the JSON string field of the `StoredReviewReminderMap`.
- `schemaVersion` and `oldReviewReminderSchemasForMigration`. These hold the current and past review reminder schemas.
- Includes a SchemaVersion inline value class.
- Includes the ReviewReminderSchema interface. All schemas, both old and current, implement this interface. Objects implementing this interface are dynamically stored in the oldReviewReminderSchemasForMigration field so they can be used for the schema migration process. An ID is set here because it's necessary for the migration process: whenever a migration occurs from an old schema to a new schema, we need to store it in a map with the key set to the ID of the review reminder; hence all ReviewReminderSchemas must have an ID.
- `performSchemaMigration` is the key method that performs a migration. It finds the schema version specified from a `StoredReviewReminderMap` in the `oldReviewReminderSchemasForMigration`, uses it to deserialize the JSON string of the map from review reminder IDs to review reminders, then runs the `migrate` method specified in the `ReviewReminderSchema` interface repeatedly until the current schema version is reached. That updated map is then re-written to SharedPreferences, completing the migration. This process differs slightly from my old process of performing review reminder migrations; whereas before the migration happened across all stored review reminders in SharedPreferences all at once, now we perform the migration for each individual read if an old schema is detected. I believe this makes the system more clean. It also means I can delete a bunch of the helper methods at the bottom of the file: `getAllReviewReminderSharedPrefsAsMap`, `deleteAllReviewReminderSharedPrefs`, and `writeAllReviewReminderSharedPrefsAsMap`. I previously only used these for the migration process and they are no longer needed, so I deleted them.
- Modified `decodeJson` so it calls the `performSchemaMigration` method if it detects an old schema.

ReviewRemindersDatabaseTest:
- Updated to support the fact that ReviewRemindersDatabase is now an object.
- Includes a TestingReviewReminderMigrationSettings object. This serves two purposes. On one hand, it is tested by ReviewRemindersDatabaseTest to validate that the migration system works. On the other hand, it serves as an example class for future developers to read when figuring out how to use the migration framework I've constructed. See the example old schemas in this object for more details.
- Added some new deserialization failure case tests to validate what happens if a StoredReviewRemindersMap is not stored correctly.
- Created a new Hamcrest matcher. We need to check if, after a migration, the essential fields of the ReviewReminders are still the same. However, we don't really care if the IDs have changed, since the ID is an internal property of the data representation and not important to the user. In fact, due to the way I have constructed ReviewReminder, the only way to "edit" a ReviewReminder object is to... delete the old one and create a new one (which I think is a good thing! it increases data privacy). Hence, the migration process consumes some IDs, and the IDs are different afterwards.
- Added a long and detailed test of the migration process.

ScheduleReminders:
- Edited to reflect the fact that ReviewRemindersDatabase is now an object, not a class.
