chore: allow translation of SearchPreference

extract & use strings from `com.github.ByteHamster:SearchPreference`
which our translators wish to translate

The repo states:

> If you want to translate the texts shown by the library together
> with your app's other strings, you can just override the strings
> defined in lib/src/main/res/values/strings.xml in your own application
> by copying those lines to your app's strings.xml.

We license the strings as MIT in a separate file so we may contribute them upstream (20-search-preference.xml)

There is a bug in using `search_preference_clear_history`:

which I am patching:

`pref_search_no_results` already exists `searchpreference_no_results`
