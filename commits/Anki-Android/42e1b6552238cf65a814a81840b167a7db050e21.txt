convert synchronous js api to  asynchronous and remove js interface (#14564)

* convert synchronous js api to  asynchronous and remove js interface
check developer contract fo api requests which modify content

- A class named AnkiDroidJS is used. When an object of this class is created, the init method must be called first. This method sets up the API with a developer contract.
- For every API request that modifies content, the developer contract is checked. This is because each request creates a POST request, and the developer contract is passed in each of these requests.
- Update js api, so it show error for previous version of deck
- Make all request post, return value to bytearray, use array for api list
- update tts api and other api to get data from request
