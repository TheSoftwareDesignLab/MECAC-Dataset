refactor: prepare AnkiActivity for review reminders

GSoC 2025: Review Reminders

- `showSimpleNotification` is used to send general notifications and sync notifications. However, for some reason, the old code didn't send general and sync notifications if legacy review alerts weren't set, which was a weird coupling. This change removes that `if` condition and just runs the code immediately. After all, whether the user has enabled legacy review alerts should not affect whether they receive sync notifications. If the user wants to disable sync notifications, they can turn off notifications in the OS settings menu.
- Gated the vibration and blink settings behind a legacy review reminders conditional. We no longer support these settings in the new review reminders system, as vibration can be configured manually by the user within the OS settings and light blinking is now an accessibility feature that cannot be set by users for specific individual apps.
