fix: remove warnings and speed up HTTPD

Removes 10 logs per side from a 'Basic' card in the reviewer

Android logs "W/System: A resource failed to call end." when a
 GZIPOutputStream is used temporarily without the outer stream
 being closed

It seems that there were 3 feasible solutions:
1) Disable gzip on the server
2) Disable all logs for this issue globally
3) Reflection + `ViolationLogger` (a `@hide` interface)

1) sped up execution on my phone, so was the obvious choice
