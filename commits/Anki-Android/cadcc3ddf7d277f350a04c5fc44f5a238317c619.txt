feat: Follow system night mode

Add option to follow system night mode

Hide follow system and day/night options in android versions without system dark mode (API < 29)
Single theme values added to avoid having to upgrade the previous themes

Remove navigation drawer toggle with changes in:
- NavigationDrawerActivity
- ic_brightness_3_black.xml
- night_mode_switch.xml
- navigation_drawer.xml
- 01-core.xml

ReviewerNoParamTest is being changed because the theme is set while the activity is created
So, night mode needs to be enabled after reviewer activity is created
