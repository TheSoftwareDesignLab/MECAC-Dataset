fix: template previewer UI

the template previewer was tightly coupled with the template editor, and
that isn't a good design. To solve that, I decoupled the template
previewer in two fragments: a view and a standalone page.
All of the original style of the template previewer was fixed.

I gave credits to BrayanDSO in TemplatePreviewerPage.kt because most of
the code is his and I don't want the credits myself

I also removed the duplicated TabLayout in the card editor because it
didn't make sense to me.
