work for libanki1.1 upgrade, also added leeches handling (no ui changes yet) and update of tags on sync. The code is now up to date with libanki commit https://github.com/dae/libanki/commit/4c5072994657b2e2a89d9993e5db58cef86ee306. Further work is needed for the changes that spilt into ankiqt when libanki was upgraded
