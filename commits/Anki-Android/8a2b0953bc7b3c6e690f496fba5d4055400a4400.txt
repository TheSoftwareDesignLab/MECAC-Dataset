TagsV16: Implement TagManager interface

Allows a TagsV16 to be used by AnkiDroid

There's little point in further consolidating the implementations
as Tags.java will be decommissioned and TagsV16 will be the only
implementation after it has been tested

After a discussion with Arthur, it makes more sense to use Nullable
over optional parameters in the Kotlin (also get a warning from the
compiler on this)

* Using optional requires a code change for the caller
* There are nullability issues in Java especially
* It deviates from our code style
* It is warned against in the compiler and StackOverflow
