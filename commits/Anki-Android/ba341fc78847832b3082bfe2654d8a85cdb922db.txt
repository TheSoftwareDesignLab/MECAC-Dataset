Convert NoteEditor to Fragment

1. AnkiFragment:
   - Introduced a base class for fragments (`AnkiFragment`) with a `@param layout` documentation referencing `CardViewerFragment`. This base class consolidates common functionality and methods for all future fragments by inheriting `AnkiFragment`.
   - Extracted methods from NoteEditor to AnkiFragment for potential reuse in other fragments.

2. NoteEditor Fragment:
   - Implemented `OnMenuItemClickListener` to handle toolbar menu item clicks.
   - Implemented `DispatchKeyEventListener` to manage key events.
   - Initialized Onboarding after the view is created to prevent initialization errors.
   - Split `onCreate()` into `onCreate()` and `onViewCreated()` to accommodate differences between activities and fragments in Android. In fragments, the view hierarchy setup (`onViewCreated()`) occurs separately from initialization (`onCreate()`), ensuring operations requiring access to the fragment's view are correctly handled post-creation.
   - Replaced `IntentCompat` with `BundleCompat` to handle null data scenarios.
   - Utilized `Bundle` instead of `Intent` in `openNewNoteEditor()` to avoid null data issues with `intent.extras`.

5. Intent Handling:
   - Updated `SingleFragmentActivity.getIntent()` to support optional `intentAction` parameters, enabling dynamic intent actions like sharing text, images, and processing text.
   - Created `IntentHandler2` for:
     - Sharing text to NoteEditor
     - Sharing image to NoteEditor
     - Sharing process text to NoteEditor
     - `Add Note` shortcut
   - Created AbstractIntentHandler:
     - Extract common initialization from IntentHandler and IntentHandler2 into AbstractIntentHandler.

6. NavigationDrawerActivity:
   - Resolved error triggering when opening NoteEditor from a shortcut (`Long press AnkiDroid App -> Add`) by redirecting the intent target from NoteEditor to IntentHandler2.

7. ManifestFile:
   - Removed NoteEditor from the manifest file due to its transition from an Activity to a Fragment.
   - Moved `NoteEditor` specific intent filters from `NoteEditor` to `IntentHandler2`

8. Testing:
   - Updated test files under the guidance of David in discord channel and feedback to ensure comprehensive test coverage aligns with the updated architecture and intent handling in AnkiDroid.
   - CardBrowserTest: The addIntent returns both SingleFragmentActivity.FRAGMENT_NAME_EXTRA and SingleFragmentActivity.FRAGMENT_ARGS_EXTRA. Since NoteEditor.EXTRA_DID is located within SingleFragmentActivity.FRAGMENT_ARGS_EXTRA, the assertions needed to be adjusted to extract and verify the arguments bundle directly.

This commit refactors NoteEditor into a Fragment, improves intent handling across activities, and enhances fragment lifecycle management for consistent behavior and performance in AnkiDroid.
