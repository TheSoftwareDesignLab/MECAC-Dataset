Only use transparent status bar for NavigationDrawerActivities

This fixes #5156 by not using a transparent status bar for layouts that aren't using DrawerLayout.
Previously the coordinator layout seemed to be drawing the primary dark color under the transparent
status bar, but recently it's stopped doing that (not sure if that's intentional or a support lib bug)
