note-editor: drop files

This commit ensures that we can drop files (photos, videos, and audio) in NoteEditor (FixedEditText).

Fix: Handle minSdkVersion conflict with DropHelper and enable file drop in NoteEditor
Added DropHelperCompat to handle the incompatibility issue with DropHelper and minSdkVersion 23. The manifest merger failed with the following error:

> Manifest merger failed: uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 23 cannot be smaller than version 24 declared in library [androidx.draganddrop:draganddrop:1.0.0] /Users/davidallison/.gradle/cache> s/8.8/transforms/0a1688833d368c1b9b07d2054911030e/transformed/draganddrop-1.0.0/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 23
> Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 23,
>     or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 24,
>     or use tools:overrideLibrary="androidx.draganddrop" to force usage
>     (may lead to runtime failures)

To resolve this, the DropHelperCompat class is used to conditionally configure the view for drag and drop operations only when the SDK version is 24 or higher.
