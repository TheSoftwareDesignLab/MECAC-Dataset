Avoid crash on browser QA render if cancelled

The mCards array is shared via TaskData into the async render DeckTask,
and in the render there is logic listening for a possible cancel, but
not until after it already attempted to touch the (possibly concurrently
mutated) mCards array, resulting in IndexOutOfBoundsException

This puts the cancel check above any usage of the shared mCards array
which should hopefully solve the race and avoid overrunning mutated mCards
