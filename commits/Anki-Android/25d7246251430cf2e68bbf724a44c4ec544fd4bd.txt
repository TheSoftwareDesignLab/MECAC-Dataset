Notify the UI that a sync was done

In this case, I really don't think it's realistic to expect an
OpChange from the backend. The backend already sends informations that
are relevant for the sync process. Given that "sync" does not uses the
processes uses for undoable change (indeed, it should not be
undoable), no OpChange is generated.

It seems reasonable in this place at least to directly notify the
observers.

Given that the observers expect an OpChanges, I create one, and simply
assume everything may be changed. This seems reasonable in case of
sync, and it's sufficiently rare that the cost won't be prohibitive
anyway.
