Fix: Inline StatusRowView accessibilityLabel modifier to avoid flashing (#1278)

By inlining this label, we avoid the creation of `ConditionalContent`, which often leads to views being recreated unnecessarily.

In focused mode, the empty label is not read as, it is the accessibility container label for the post component elements.
