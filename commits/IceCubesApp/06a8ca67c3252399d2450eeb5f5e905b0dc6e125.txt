Improve display of HTML ul (bullet list) and ol (numbered list) (#1690)

While SwiftUI's `Text` view won't display these in an `AttributedString` even if they get parsed from Markdown (which would also require the use of the `.full` option instead of the `.inlineOnlyPresrevingWhitespace` option), we can improve the appearance somewhat.
Currently, list elements are clumped together with no spaces between them, and there's no indication whatsoever that the author indicated these to be a list.
Change to insert Markdown list syntax with linebreaks and dashes, so users can at least understand there's a list there.
Similar change for ordered lists.

This will still be broken for nested lists, but it didn't seem worth it to put a lot of effort into this (or other revamps, like making bold/italics/code work properly) because it seems like the current text handling in Ice Cubes is suboptimal and eventually slated for improvement (according to https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp/issues/1459#issuecomment-1638562657).
So this is more designed to make lists "less broken" in some cases, rather than be a comprehensive fix for all lists in all cases.
