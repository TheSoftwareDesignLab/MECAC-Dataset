Refactor MediaView layout and item rendering

Simplifies media layout logic by removing redundant count checks and using a single ForEach for rendering media items. Updates frame and animation bindings to use viewModel properties directly, and improves media item view by adding contentShape and disables hit testing for images. Cleans up unused code and streamlines the layout for better maintainability.
