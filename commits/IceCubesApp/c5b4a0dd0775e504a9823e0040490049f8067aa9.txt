Settings screen Accessibility tweaks (#1258)

* Remove `.button` trait from `Link`s on Account Settings screen

SwiftUI currently sets both the `.button` and `.link` traits on these elements, which is a failure for WCAG 2.1 4.12: Name, Role, Value: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html

There is a radar for this issue: FB11507660

* Improve accessibility by making `AppAccountView`s a Button

Previously, the component elements of the `fullView` would be rendered as 3-4 individual views that would _all_ be interactive and perform the same action.

Now, as a Button, only one accessibility element is vended.

* Fix account label color
