Compose Post Screen Accessibility Tweaks (#1259)

* Add localized label for the AI prompt status accessory view

Previously, this icon would have an accessibility label matching its SF symbol key, ‘faxmachine’.

* Darken status editor character count foreground color

By changing it to .secondary, it gets to an APCA contrast of 61, which is a _just_ passing Bronze score for that text size.

It’s still quite short of WCAG 2.1 AA at 3.3:1 (recommended is 4.5:1)

* Change remaining character count color to red when < 0

* Refine remaining character count accessibility

In this commit, we
- Change its trait to `.updatesFrequently`
- Set a localized `accessibilityLabel`
- Set its `accessibilityValue` to the remaining character count
- Disable user interaction (which is presumably set automatically by virtue of being enclosed in a `Menu`)

* Set accessibilitySortPriority on Status editor ScrollView

Previously, the traversal order placed the elements inside the `ScrollView` last. Now, they follow on from the navigation bar contents in the expected order.

* Hide the AvatarView from status creation accessibility

When there is only one account available, there is no functionality associated with this element, so it is considered decorative-only, and should be hidden

* Set TextView placeholder’s `accessibilityValue` to placeholder text when empty

This behaviour matches `UITextField`

* Hide TextView custom `placeholderView` from accessibility

Previously, TextView would vend two accessibility elements when the placeholder was visible. This causes needless confusion for users.

Now, the TextView matches the accessible behaviour of text inputs elsewhere.

* Improve accessibility of post `privacyMenu`

Previously, it would be presented as `Everyone, Button`. Now, we move the visibility to its `value` and use `Visibility` for its label, in conjunction with a hint that states it `Changes post audience`.

* Add `.button` trait and accessible label to emojis in `customEmojisSheet`

Previously, these would all present as `image` with no description, making it very hard to discern what kind of emoji you were adding.

* Change drafts sheet item type to `Button`

A button with an action has a more accessible representation than a `Text` with a tap gesture.
