Timeline & Timeline detail accessibility uplift (#1323)

* Improve accessibility of StatusPollView

Previously, this view did not provide the proper context to indicate that it represented a poll.

Now, we’ve added
- A container that will stay “Active poll” or “Poll results” when the cursor first hits one of the options;
- A prefix to say “Option X of Y” before each option;
- A Selected trait on the selected option(s), if present
- Consolidating and adding an `.updatesFrequently` trait to the footer view with the countdown.

* Add poll description in StatusRowView combinedAccessibilityLabel

This largely duplicates the logic in `StatusPollView`.

* Improve accessibility of media attachments

Previously, the media attachments without alt text would not show up in the consolidated `StatusRowView`, nor would they be meaningfully explained on the status detail screen.

Now, they are presented with their attachment type.

* Change accessibilityRepresentation of AppAcountsSelectorView

* Change Notifications tab title view accessibility representation to Menu

Previously it would present as a button

* Hide layout `Rectangle`s from accessibility

* Consolidate `StatusRowDetailView` accessibility representation

* Improve readability of Poll accessibility label

* Ensure poll options don’t present as interactive when the poll is finished

* Improve accessibility of StatusRowCardView

Previously, it would present as four separate elements, including an image without a description, all interactive, none with an interactive trait.

Now, it presents as a single element with the `.link` trait

* Improve accessibility of StatusRowHeaderView

Previously, it had no traits and no actions except inherited ones.

Now it presents as a button, triggering its primary action.

It also has custom actions corresponding to its context menu

* Avoid applying the StatusRowView custom actions to every view when contained

* Provide context for the application name

* Add pauses to StatusRowView combinedAccessibilityLabel

* Hide `TimelineView.scrollToTopView` from accessibility

* Set appropriate font style on Notification header

After the change the Text needed a `.headline` style to match the prior appearance.

* Fix bug in accessibilityRepresentation of TimelineView nav bar title

Previously, it would not display the proper label for .remoteLocal filter options.

* Ensure that pop-up button nav bar titles are interactive

* Ensure TextView responds to Environment.sizeCategory

This resolves #1309

* Fix button
