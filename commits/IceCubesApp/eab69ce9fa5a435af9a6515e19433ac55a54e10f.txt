Timeline tab accessibility uplift (#1277)

* Refine Profile tab VoiceOver order to prioritise user information

Previously, VoiceOver user would have to traverse through header image, “follows you”, and the profile image before getting to the display name of the user.

Now, this element is the first element after the navigation bar.

* Add accessibility label to Timeline Compose post button

Previously, this button was using the SF symbol fallback label.

Now, it has a localized equivalent in addition to two other options: “New”, and “Create”

* Change accessible representation of Timeline nav bar menu

Previously, this would present as a static text.

Now, it has the header trait. In addition, by changing the representation, VoiceOver will read it out as “Home, Pop-up button, Header”, indicating that it opens a menu.

* Add accessibilityHint to Timeline tab Accounts selector

* Add accessibilityLabel and hint to PendingStatusesObserver

Previously, this button would have a label equal to the count of unread posts. Now, it states “X new posts” with the hint “Scrolls the timeline”
