Fix the lag of the display setting sliders (#1342) close #1341

* Fix the lag of the display setting sliders

The sliders in the display settings were laggy because changing the value in the
theme class needs comparatively much time. This writing to the class is now
only done when the user lets go of the slider, so sliding it is responsive. I
was unable to make writing to the class more responsive, the example post needs
therefore a short time before it accepts the new values. Furthermore, all
AppStorage keys are now realized with a ThemeKey to clean the class up.
Fixes #1341

* Remove unnecessary changes to theme

The changing of theme keys is unnecessary for the fix oft the lag, so it's
removed.

* Rework fix to be more similar to other lag fixes

The fix now uses the ...LocalValues class, which published updates only every
half a second.
