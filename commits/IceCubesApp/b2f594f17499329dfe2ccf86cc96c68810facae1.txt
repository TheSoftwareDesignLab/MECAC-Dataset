Accessibility tweaks + Notifications and Messages tab uplift (#1292)

* Improve StatusRowView accessibility actions

Previously, there was no way to interact with links and hashtags.

Now, these are added to the Actions rotor

* Hide `topPaddingView`s from accessibility

* Fix accessible header rendering in non-filterable TimelineViews

Previously, all navigation title views were assumed to be popup buttons.

Now, we only change the representation for timelines that are filterable.

* Combine tagHeaderView text elements

Previously, these were two separate items

* Prefer shorter Quote action label

* Improve accessibility of StatusEmbeddedView

Previously, this element would be three different ones, and include all the actions on the `StatusRowView` proper. Now, it presents as one element with no actions.

* Add haptics to StatusRowView accessibility actions

* Improve accessibility of ConversationsListRow

This commit adds:
- A combined representation of the component views
- “Unread” as the first part of the label (if this is the case)
- All relevant actions as custom actions
- Reply as magic tap

* Remove StatusRowView accessibilityActions if viewModel.showActions is false

* Hide media attachments from accessibility if the view is not focused

* Combine NotificationRowView accessibility elements; add user actions

Previously, there was no real way to interact with these notifications.

Now, the notifications that show the actions row have the appropriate StatusRowView-derived actions, and new followers notifications have more actions that let you see each user’s profile.

* Prefer @Environment’s `accessibilityEnabled` over `isVoiceOverRunning`

This way we can cater for Voice Control, Full Keyboard Access and Switch Control as well.
