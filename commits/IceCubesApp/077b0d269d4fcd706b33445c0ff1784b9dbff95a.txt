Bugfix 1459 - Escape ~ character as markdown (#1561)

* Add simple test for escaping markdown content in statuses

* Add ~ as markdown character to be escaped in statuses

The ~ isn't documented in the original markdown syntax docs but is
commonly used (including by AttributedString) to surround text
formatted with a strikethrough.
