This simplifies the parser.   Having read the spec more closely as part of investigating bug 855, I was overcomplicating it.  The server promises to send html so we should render it that way, not with heuristics. (#900)

This puts in line breaks exclusively where there are <br>s and takes out other line breaks that are in the body text.

*Doesn't* fix bug 855
