Italian translation (#1532)

- Replacement of the term "Bottone" in "Pulsante", the first term is mainly connected to clothing, instead the use of "Pulsante" identifies more precisely the concept of using a physical or virtual button.

- Maintaining the Boost term: on Twitter, in Italy, it's usual to use terms such as "tweets, retweets, and others". Therefore, the maintenance of the Boost word has been preferred rather than the total change to "Condividi".

- Reference buttons should eliminate the use of the word "Enable" as the visual switch is the element that confirms to the user whether the action is enabled or not. Further advice is to place the information icon "i" next to the switches, which allows the user to better understand the use of these features.

- Translation of: accessibility, filters, package: status, package: notifications, package: explore, package: conversations, package: account.

- Miscellaneous and minor changes

ATTENTION: using words like "social media love" and then asking "Happy messaging" can lead to misleading messages. They should be removed from all translations.
