* Fix build

* Fix theme

* Transition to KeychainSwift, clean up

KeychainHelper is replaced with the already-used KeychainSwift package, the
functions are cleaned up so that the process is easier to understand. The
deactivateToggleIfNoKey function doesn't change the behavior of the buttons or
context menus in the timeline, only demonstrates the necessity of an API key to
the user. Consequently, it's only called when the settings view is shown.
