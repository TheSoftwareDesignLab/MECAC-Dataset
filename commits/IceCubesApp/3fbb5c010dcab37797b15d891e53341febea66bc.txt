Add quote approval support to status actions

Introduces the QuoteApproval model and integrates it into Status and ReblogStatus. Updates StatusActionButton to disable quoting when the current user is denied, and passes the status object to the button for approval checks. This enables finer control over quote permissions in the UI.
