Resolve escaped characters in a status (#2071)

* Resolve escaped characters in a status

Escaped characters are now returned to their original form for
HTMLString.asRawText.

* Unescape the markdown version too

The HTMLString.asMarkdown string is now also unescaped, &amp; and
similar are resolved.

* Fix a internal fallback

If one of the unescape(...) commands fails, the original, unescaped
text is used instead of an empty string.
