Automatically detect language of posts, improve language detection when posting (#800)

* Use language detection to translate posts

The source language of a post is now determined via Apples internal language
detection, translation from the transmitted language is still possible.

* Make language detection posting more accessible

Language recognition is now always applied before posting, even if the user has
explicitly selected a different language. However, the user is always asked in
which of the two languages he wants to post.

* Add localizations

* Remove language detection in the timeline for now

The language detection in the timeline is for now removed to increase
timeline-performance.
