Accessibility bug fixes (#1348)

* Fix bug affecting accessibillityRepresentation of type Toggle

Previously, the action on the button would not get executed. This is a SwiftUI bug, as views passed into `accessibilityRepresentation` should not have any behaviour.

Now, we set an equivalent `accessibilityValue` on|off to emulate the same functionality.

* Remove conditional ViewModifier in favour of inlined modifier

Since this view is part of the `StatusRowView` it’s better to err on the side of less branching with ModifiedContent<>

* Avoid combining StatusRowMediaPreviewView accessibility children

By combining the elements, the end result was that the intended action (opening QuickLook) was swallowed in favour of displaying the alt text alert of images.
