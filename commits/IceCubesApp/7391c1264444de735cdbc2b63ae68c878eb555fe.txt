Accessibility fix for Timeline `StatusRowView` and Status detail (#1355)

* Add StatusRowView accessibility action to open media attachment viewer

Previously, there would be no way to open QuickLook from the timeline.

Now, we add a custom accessibility action to do this.

* Work around initial accessibility focus bug in StatusDetailView

Previously, (due to identity issues?) the focus would be set on the header view. However, moving to the next element in the focus order. would skip over a random number of elements, depending on the context of the detail view.

Now, we manually set the focus once, allowing the focus order to work as intended.

* Respect filters in Timeline combined accessibility label

* Add explicit action to show filtered warnings from `filterView`
