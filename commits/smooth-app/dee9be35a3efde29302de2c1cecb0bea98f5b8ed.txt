fix: #2729 - product query page - simplified top messages and buttons (#2736)

Impacted files:
* `app_en.arb`: resized "world" labels - one shorter, one longer
* `app_fr.arb`: resized "world" labels - one shorter, one longer
* `product_query_page.dart`: now displaying actions as app bar icon buttons (and large buttons for empty results); replaced the banner with a simple card; refactored; no more display of "everything downloaded" final text; no more "refresh" large button; displays country name in the result summary
* `product_query_page_helper.dart`: minor refactoring
