* feat: 3332 - crop page title now reflects image field

Impacted files:
* `confirm_and_upload_picture.dart`: minor refactoring
* `crop_helper.dart`: added a `pageTitle` parameter
* `edit_ingredients_page.dart`: minor refactoring
* `image_crop_page.dart`: added `imageField` parameters, so that we can compute the correct label on crop page
* `image_upload_card.dart`: now we explicitly use `getProductImageButtonText` as label
* `new_crop_page.dart`: added a page title parameter
* `product_cards_helper.dart`: new label method `getImagePageTitle`; minor refactoring
* `product_image_carousel.dart`: minor refactoring

* `product_image_gallery_view.dart`: minor refactoring
* `product_image_swipeable_view.dart`: now we explicitly use `getImagePageTitle` as label
* `product_image_viewer.dart`: minor refactoring
