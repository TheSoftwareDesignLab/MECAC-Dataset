feature/#166_2 - products in pantries are now reorderable, with a drag handle

Impacted files:
* `pantry.dart`: added the notion of ordered barcodes and the related methods
* `pantry_page.dart`: used a `ReorderableListView` instead of a `ListView`
* `smooth_product_card_found.dart`: added an optional handle `Widget` at the level of the product title
