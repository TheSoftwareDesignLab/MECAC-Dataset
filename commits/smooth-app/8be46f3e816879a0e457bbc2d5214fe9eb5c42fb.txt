feature/#166 _4 - put back pantries and shopping lists, as regular "database" product lists

Now the database and the code is much more consistent.
Is that relevant to display pantries and shopping lists in the home page? That's another story.
But at least for the tests and for brainstorming purposes, it's good to see that it's easy to create product list types with different UIs.
