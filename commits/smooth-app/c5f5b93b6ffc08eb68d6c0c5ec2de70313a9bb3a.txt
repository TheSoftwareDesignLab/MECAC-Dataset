feature/#55 - experimenting the NotifyListeners method in a clean model without Widgets

Impacted files:
* `alternative_continuous_scan_page.dart`: refactoring mainly due to changes in `ContinuousScanModel`
* `continuous_scan_model.dart`: now we don't deal with `Widget`s, only metadata, and we use a NotifyListeners method
* `continuous_scan_page.dart`: refactoring mainly due to changes in `ContinuousScanModel`
* `contribution_page.dart`: unrelated refactoring about the use of `UserPreferences`
* `local_database.dart`: added a temporary "dummy"`NotifyListeners` method, for the sake of demonstration - to be removed
* `smooth_product_carousel.dart`: now we build the `Widget`s from metadata, and we control here the carousel
