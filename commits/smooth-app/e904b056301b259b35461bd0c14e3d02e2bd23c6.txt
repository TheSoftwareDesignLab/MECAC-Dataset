* When we highlight a suggestion, we can't rely on the `removeDiacritics`, as it replaces some letters of 1 word into 2 or +

* Better algorithm

* Remove unused things

* Fix typo

* Unnecessary brackets

* Replace all `toLowerCase` + `removeDiacritics` by a single `getComparisonSafeString`

* Reformat CountrySelector

* `removeAccents` removed + 1 new test
