Search panel UX follow-ups (#564)

This change
- Adds a "clear" button to the search field that also acts as a "close" button when the field is empty
- Adds an animation to the disappearing text when the panel opens.
- Changes the keyboard action key to "Search"
- Removes the search field and search history card from the old home page (that sits in the "History" tab right now)
