fix: Fixed spacing below website card (#4349)

* fix: Fixed spacing below website card

     - Issue:
       * The website card had very little space below;

     - Fix:
       * Added a verticle margin with `MEDIUM_SPACE` value instead of using default paramter which was only adding horizontal margin.

* - Removed the padding from the website widget and wrapped the `ListView` inside bottom padding.

* - Add padding so that it is only visible at the end of scroll.

* Update packages/smooth_app/lib/pages/product/new_product_page.dart

* - Fixed formatting removed additional space.
