feature/#290 - Local search on pantry page, with product automatically added

New file:
* `text_search_widget.dart`: Local product search by text

Impacted files:
* `home_page.dart`: moved text search code to new `TextSearchWidget` class
* `pantry.dart`: renamed method `add` as `addAll`; added method `add` as an "add single item" method
* `pantry_page.dart`: added a `TextSearchWidget` on top of the screen; a product is automatically added after a product page is reached from the search and then pop'ed
* `smooth_product_image.dart`: unrelated fix where width and height are mandatory, and several image front urls are tried
