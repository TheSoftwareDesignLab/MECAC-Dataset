fix: #2773 - appropriate "clear?" and "delete?" messages for user lists (#2778)

Impacted files:
* `app_en.arb`: labels for user lists (clear? + delete?)
* `app_fr.arb`: labels for user lists (clear? + delete?)
 * `product_list_page.dart`: now using the new "clear?" label for user lists
 * `product_list_user_dialog_helper.dart`: now localizing with the new "delete?" label for user lists
