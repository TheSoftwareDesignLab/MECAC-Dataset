feature/#429 - possible barcode suggestions

Impacted files:
* `bulk_manager.dart`: unrelated - fixed a bug about the number of parameters for bulk insert; `insert` method now returns the number of inserted rows; `delete` method now returns the number of deleted rows
* `dao_product.dart`: added barcode for suggestion if text is number; refactored
* `text_search_widget.dart`: added the barcode to the suggestion results
