fix: #2706 - now we display the "LOGIN!" button only if not logged in (#2714)

Impacted files:
* `abstract_user_preferences.dart`: added an "additional subtitle" method, returning a `null` widget by default
* `user_preferences_account.dart`: (only) implementation of the "additional subtitle", that displays the "LOGIN!" button, but only if not logged in (that's the issue fix)
* `user_preferences_page.dart`: now we let each item decide if there's an additional subtitle to display beyond the list tile (and its layout constraints)
