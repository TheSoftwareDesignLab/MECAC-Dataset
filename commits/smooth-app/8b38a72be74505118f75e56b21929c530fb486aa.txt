feat: 2484 - now when editing we go to the full image with the cropped area on top (#3658)

Impacted files:
* `app_en.arb`: added a label for the "send image" button (instead of vague "confirm")
* `background_task_crop.dart`: added a product change where we store the crop parameters
* `background_task_image.dart`: added a fake product change where we remove the crop parameters
* `new_crop_page.dart`: added constructor parameters `initialCropRect` and `initialRotation`; removed the "new photo" button for UI/UX consistency
* `product_image_viewer.dart`: refactored with 2 or 4 buttons and cleaner code
* `product_query.dart`: added `IMAGES` product field
* `pubspec.lock`: wtf
* `pubspec.yaml`: upgraded `openfoodfacts` to `2.2.1` (about `ProductImage`)
* `rotation.dart`: added method `fromDegrees`
* `up_to_date_changes.dart`: added `images` to "overwritable" product fields; now accepts all operation types
