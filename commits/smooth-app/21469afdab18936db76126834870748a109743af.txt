feat: Create a screen listing all attributes for a product (#4714)

* feat: Create a screen listing all attributes for a product

- resolves: #4673
- I have just added a simple button in edit product page just to test the
new page. It will be removed and added in the paticular screen.
- taking `edit_product_page.dart` as a base `product_attribute_page.dart`
is designed as suggested by teolemon.
- Added all the mentioned section field in the issue.

* refactor: chnages done according to the feedback

- created seperte file for `svg_icon.dar`
- created newFile for `attribute_first_row_widget.dart`
- removed refreshIndicator
- useed stringbuffer for string concatenation
- fix: linting errors

* fix: move nutrients extraction to init state

- to avoid recalculation on every build

* remove usage of knowledgepanel, use product.nutriments

* move ingredient extraction to initstate

* helper abstract class for attribute_first_row_widget

* remove ui file and abstract ontap function

* tiny fix

* change ontap function to future<void>

* Update packages/smooth_app/lib/pages/product/attribute_first_row_helper.dart
