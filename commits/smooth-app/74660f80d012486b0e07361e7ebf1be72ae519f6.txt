fix: 5554 - display of cached counts on user page (#5573)

New files:
* `lazy_counter.dart`: Lazy Counter, with a cached value stored locally, and a call to the server.
* `lazy_counter_widget.dart`: Widget displaying a Lazy Counter: cached value, refresh button, and loading.

Impacted files:
* `user_preferences.dart`: added methods about storing a lazy count value
* `user_preferences_account.dart`: refactored the display of counts with the new `LazyCounter` and `LazyCounterWidget` classes
