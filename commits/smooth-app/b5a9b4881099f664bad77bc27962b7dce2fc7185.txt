fix: Another way to translate iOS files (#1563)

* Revert "Prepare iOS translation mechanism"

This reverts commit 2e652404103d8da506b59f8f3e700a4e122061aa.

* Let's try to translate iOS strings this way

* Crowdin configuration updated for iOS

* "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription" is never used in the app, but is mandatory.
To prevent any confusion, we won't translate it
