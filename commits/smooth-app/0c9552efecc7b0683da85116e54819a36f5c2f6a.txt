refactor: #954 - split the nutrition page code for better focus (#1142)

New file:
* `nutrition_container.dart`: Nutrition data, for nutrient order and conversions.
* `tmp_to_off_nutriments.dart`: Nutrient ids supported by `Nutriments`, to be moved to off-dart

Impacted file:
* `nutrition_page_loaded.dart`: moved the nutrient and conversion code to new class `NutritionContainer`
