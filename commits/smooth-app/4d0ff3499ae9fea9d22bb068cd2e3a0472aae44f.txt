feat: Updated the summary page (#581)

Please note that there are a lot of moving elements that are not final in this PR, specifically:

1. The group ordering or the attributes inside groups will change on the server
2. Attribute titles will change from the server
3. Attribute icons are still not final, and will change, currently we have 3 shades of colors that will most likely change to 5, instead of emojis we will most likely use icons.
4. The red panel on top of the card is currently static, it will be modified based on a new field from backend.
5. the styling of the Divider will change
6. None of the UI elements are currently final, (padding, text style, colors etc).

Please also note that this PR has a side-effect of changing the background color of the app's theme to material-light-blue from material-blue. This is in sync with the current mocks.
