fix: 3570 - background task order is now respected (#3591)

* fix: 3570 - background task order is now respected

Impacted files:
* `app_en.arb`: added a label for the "stop this task ASAP?" question and the corresponding task label
* `background_task_manager.dart`: fixed a bug where the task list was refreshed inappropriately; now it's possible to cancel a task; refactored
* `offline_tasks_page.dart`: now when you click on a task, you can stop it ASAP (for the record that does not mean immediately)

* fix: 3570 - better task cleaning when successful or dismissed

Impacted files:
* `abstract_background_task.dart`: added a "success?" parameter to `postExecute`
* `background_task_details.dart`: minor refactoring
* `background_task_image.dart`: made the distinction between a simple garbage collecting and a successful task run
* `background_task_manager.dart`: now we clean deeper when we remove a task
* `background_task_refresh_later.dart`: minor refactoring
