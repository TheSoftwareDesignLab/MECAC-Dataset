fix: 3858 - display nothing if no KP widget children found (#3859)

Impacted files:
* `knowledge_panel_page_template.dart`: now using the KP children in order to be able to display nothing
* `knowledge_panels_builder.dart`: now we build a list of children, which gives us the opportunity to display nothing if empty
* `new_onboarding_page.dart`: now using the KP children in order to be able to display nothing
