feature/#218 - 3 possible colors for the app theme

Deleted file:
* `theme_manager.dart`: refactored to `UserPreferences`, for consistency

Impacted files:
* `main.dart`: refactored the theme provider that now uses `UserPreferences` and provides several colors
* `profile_page.dart`: added the theme palette choice; refactored
* `smooth_listTile.dart`: added flexibility with a possible title Widget instead of a Text
* `smooth_theme.dart`: added the color to the theme; minor bug fix
* `theme_provider.dart`: refactored using `UserPreferences`; added the color
* `user_preferences.dart`: moved there the "darkness", and added the theme color
