feature/#21 - scan now uses local database, for product look up and for its history

New file:
* `scan_page.dart`: helper class to be used on top of `AlternativeContinuousScanPage` and `ContinuousScanPage`

Impacted files:
* `alternative_continuous_scan_page.dart`: `ContinuousScanModel` is now initialized upstream by `ScanPage`
* `continuous_scan_model.dart`: now a `ChangeNotifier`, uses a `ProductList` and database cache
* `continuous_scan_page.dart`: `ContinuousScanModel` is now initialized upstream by `ScanPage`
* `contribution_page.dart`: uses the new `ScanPage` widget instead of the 2 scan pages
* `local_database.dart`: removed the dummy notify listener method
* `main.dart`: uses the new `ScanPage` widget instead of the 2 scan pages
* `personalized_ranking_page.dart`: now we use a `ProductList` as input
* `product_list.dart`: added a `getProduct` method and a "scan list" identifier
* `product_page.dart`: unrelated UI fixes
* `product_query_page.dart`: slight refactoring
* `smooth_it_model.dart`: now we use `ProductList`
* `smooth_product_carousel.dart`: added the new "CACHED" product possibility; fixed an init bug
