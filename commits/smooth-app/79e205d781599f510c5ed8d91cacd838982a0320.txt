feat: Clearer 'Packaging components' preview and modified the maximum size of the autocomplete tab. (#3744)

* Updated the preview of the package in the 'Packaging components ' tab.

Preview is now clearer and more coherent with what is shown on the product page.

* Autocomplete now gives hints before anything is typed & maxOptionsHeight fixed

- The autocomplete now gives the most common answers for the field before user start typing. (Useful for packaging material, recycling...)

- Fixing _AssertionError 'maxOptionsHeight >= 0': is not true:
      The old formula could give negative values. It could also create an unreadable autocomplete if the field was too close to the keyboard.

* Removed Autocomplete now gives hints before anything is typed.

@monsieurtanuki as addressed the issue in #3750 without disturbing old default behavior of the widget.

* Comment explaining the limit of suggestions.
