fix: 4957 - SVG icons are now correctly refreshed when their URL change (#5133)

Impacted files:
* `asset_cache_helper.dart`: added a relevant `key`
* `svg_cache.dart`: used the helper `key` so that flutter does refresh the widget for different URLs
* `svg_safe_network.dart`: used a `key`; unrelated error message improvement
