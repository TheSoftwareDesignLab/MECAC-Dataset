fix: 3964 - text messages instead of circular indicator for crop page + isolate (#3965)

Impacted files:
* `app_en.arb`: added 5 labels for the action progress on crop page
* `background_task_image.dart`: minor refactoring
* `crop_page.dart`: displays a text instead of a stuttering circular progress indicator; minor refatoring
* `image_compute_container.dart`: now using `compute` as much as possible - still not possible for `ui`
