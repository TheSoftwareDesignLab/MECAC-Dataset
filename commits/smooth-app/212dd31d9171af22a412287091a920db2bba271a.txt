feat: #678 - added bottom navigation bar to product page (#679)

The previous bottom navigation bottom bar was refactored, in order to be reused anywhere.
Then it was added to the product page.

Deleted files:
* `home_page.dart`
* `smooth_ui_library/smooth_bottom_navigation_bar.dart`
* `smooth_ui_library/smooth_bottom_navigation_bar_item.dart`

New file:
* `smooth_bottom_navigation_bar.dart`

Impacted files:
* `continuous_scan_page.dart`: added an explicit bottom navigation bar (was implicit through `HomePage`), explicitly on the "scan" tab
* `main.dart`: not using `HomePage` anymore; opens the "scan" page by default
* `new_product_page.dart`: added an explicit bottom navigation bar (was not there), implicitly on the "default" tab
* `product_list_page.dart`: added an explicit bottom navigation bar (was implicit through `HomePage`), explicitly on the "history" tab
* `product_page.dart`: added an explicit bottom navigation bar (was not there), implicitly on the "default" tab
* `smooth_ui_library.dart`: removed "UI" version of smooth bottom navigation bar
* `user_preferences_page.dart`:  added an explicit bottom navigation bar (was implicit through `HomePage`), explicitly on the "profile" tab
