feat: #2396 - better memory management - load products only when needed (#2609)

Deleted files:
* `scan_page_helper.dart`: refactored as there was only a single small method there, with a lousy "ignore" management.
* `smooth_main_button.dart`: old redundant button that did not fit the latest UI

New files:
* `personalized_ranking_model.dart`: Model that computes the scores and sorts the barcodes accordingly.
* `product_model.dart`: Model for product database get and refresh.
* `scan_product_card_loader.dart`: Display of product for the scan page, after async load from local database.
* `tmp_matched_product_v2.dart`: to be merged into off-dart

Impacted files:
* `app_en.arb`: added a label for "refresh_with_new_preferences"
* `app_fr.arb`: added a label for "refresh_with_new_preferences"
* `continuous_scan_model.dart`: now we don't store Product and we let the product cards get the product from the local db if and only if needed
* `dao_product.dart`: minor refactoring
* `dao_product_list.dart`: now we don't deal with products anymore, just barcodes.

* `partial_product_list.dart`: now we don't deal with products anymore, just barcodes.

* `product_list_import_export.dart`: refactored
