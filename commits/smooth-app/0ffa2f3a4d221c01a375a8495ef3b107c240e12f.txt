feature/#214 - explicit "create a list" button instead of "empty" text
For empty product lists only for the moment.

Impacted files:
* `list_page.dart`: replaced the "Empty" text with an explicit "create a food list" button, which eventually goes to the newly created product page
* `product_list_dialog_helper.dart`: method `openNew` now returns a `ProductList` instead of a simple `bool`
