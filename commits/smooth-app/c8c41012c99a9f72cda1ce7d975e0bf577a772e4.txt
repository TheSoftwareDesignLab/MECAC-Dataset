fix: 6587 - fine tuning about prices infinite scrolling (#6620)

Impacted files:
* `infinite_scroll_list.dart`: no more reference to "prices" or pages in the count label; added a snackbar about counts when scrolling down
* `infinite_scroll_manager.dart`: minor refactoring
* `prices_locations_page.dart`: now ordering by descending counts, and using the prices env of the app (instead of always PROD)
* `prices_users_page.dart`: now displaying pages of 20 users
