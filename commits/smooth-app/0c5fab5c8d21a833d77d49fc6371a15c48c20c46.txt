feat: #2503 - language selector now in "App Settings" (for all users) (#2658)

Impacted files:
* `language_selector.dart`: refactored for consistent data and filter
* `user_preferences_dev_mode.dart`: removed the language selector
* `user_preferences_settings.dart`: put the language selector, slightly refactored for UI consistency with country selector
