fix: 3018 - instant upload of images (#3329)

New files:
* `ocr_widget.dart`: Widget dedicated to OCR, with 3 actions: upload image, extract data, save. Used to be in `edit_ingredients_page.dart`
* `transient_file.dart`: Helper class about transient files (= not fully uploaded yet).

Impacted files:
* `add_basic_details_page.dart`: minor refactoring
* `add_new_product_page.dart`: refactored around the class image repository
* `app_en.arb`: added 1 label when OCR fails
* `app_fr.arb`: added 1 label when OCR fails
* `background_task_details.dart`: minor refactoring
* `background_task_image.dart`: immediate execution with just one try
* `confirm_and_upload_picture.dart`: minor refactoring with new private class `_OutlinedButton`
* `edit_ingredients_page.dart`: moved `OcrWidget` code to dedicated new dart file; fixed the extract button - that cannot be reached if the image is not uploaded yet
* `image_crop_page.dart`: refactored with more explicit method names
* `image_upload_card.dart`: refactored with `TransientFile`
* `new_product_page.dart`: minor refactoring
* `product_cards_helper.dart`: minor refactoring
* `product_image_carousel.dart`: minor refactoring
* `product_image_gallery_view.dart`: refactored with new method `confirmAndUploadNewPicture` and new class `TransientFile`
* `product_image_viewer.dart`: refactored with new class `TransientFile`
* `question_card.dart`: minor refactoring
* `smooth_product_image.dart`: refactored with new class `TransientFile`
