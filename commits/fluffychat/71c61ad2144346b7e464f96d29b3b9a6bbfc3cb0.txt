fix: minor issues in room list

- allow to discard focus of search field
- properly circle the search field's progress indicator
- always keep search sections visible in order to workaround annoying
  behavior: When quickly searching for a chat and one is fast at
clicking on a room, it often happens that server side results just drop
in at this moment and one clicks at the wrong item -> with a static
height as now set, this no longer happens.
