Exclude extra data detectors.

Data detectors work by matching local text against a series of local
matchers. No network activity is required. Some of the data detectors
are really useful (e.g. a link, or being able to copy a phone number).

Some aren't very useful, e.g. pop culture references, and seeing things
underlined is giving people the false impression that their data is
being inspected remotely.
