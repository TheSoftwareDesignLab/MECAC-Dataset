Revert buggy zh_TW translation for now

I synced translations in e85c2894278bc5d4929b0adbc5123a849e1db61d.
The `zh_TW` translation had a string that caused the file to be
syntactically invalid.

I ran this to fix it:

    git checkout e85c2894278bc5d4929b0adbc5123a849e1db61d~1 Signal/translations/zh_TW.lproj/PluralAware.stringsdict

In the long term, we'll fix this string, and this problem will go away.
