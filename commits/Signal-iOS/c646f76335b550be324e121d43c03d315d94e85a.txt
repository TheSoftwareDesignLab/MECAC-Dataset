Garther audio concerns, clean up session when done

- sync speakerphone state manipulated from system call screen
  - Revert audio session after call failure, ensures media plays out of
    speaker after placing a failing call.
  - Replace notification with delegate pattern since we're already using
    delegate pattern here.
- Fixes voiceover accessibility after voice memo
- Avoid audio blip after pressing hangup
- Rename CallAudioSession -> OWSAudioSession
  Going to start using it for other non-call things since we want to
  gather all our audio session concerns.
- Resume background audio when done playing video
  - Extract OWSVideoPlayer which ensures audio is in proper state before
    playback
  - Move recording session logic to shared OWSAudioSession
  - Deactivate audio session when complete
