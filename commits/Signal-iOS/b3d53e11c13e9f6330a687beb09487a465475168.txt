Dismiss when presented view when switching conversations

Fixes the scenario wherein:
- enter conversation with Alice, enter MediaSend flow
- receive a message from Bob, tap on the in-app notification
- Alice's CVC has been replaced by Bob's CVC, but you can't see that because
  the MediaSend modal is still being presented.
