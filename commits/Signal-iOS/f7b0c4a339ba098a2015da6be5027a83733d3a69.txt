"Attach Link" UX improvements.

* Fix faulty logic in validation of a URL parsed from string.

`OWSLinkPreview.isPermittedLinkPreviewUrl(parsedFrom:)` has logic to extract
hostname from a string that matches a detected URL. The logic was assuming that
every string begins with a scheme prefix (eg "http://"). That assumption isn't
always correct because NSDataDetector uses HTTP scheme when scheme prefix is not
present (eg "google.com" would result in "http://google.com" being detected).

* Two improvements to "attach link" UX.

• any valid HTTPS url can be attached to a text story, even if the link wouldn't
  actually work.
• show progress indicator while fetching a link preview.

* Add "https://" to address in "attach link preview" UI if necessary.
