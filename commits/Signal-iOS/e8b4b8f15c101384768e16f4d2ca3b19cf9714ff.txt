Scripts: `subprocess.check_output` should use `text=True` for compatibility

In Python 2, `subprocess.check_output` returns a string. In Python 3, it
returns a byte string unless you provide `text=True`.

This makes sure all calls have that option for compatibility.

Also, my editor was auto-formatting these with [Black][0], which I
didn't prevent, so now these files are formatted a little better.
