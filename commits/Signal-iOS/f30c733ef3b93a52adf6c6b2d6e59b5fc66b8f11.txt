Custom contact picker for invite flow

Preferred to the system contact picker because:
1. removes "group" clutter from header, unlikely to be used much.
2. can select while searching
3. fixes unified contact problem where e.g.
   If only one of your contact has a phone number, they appear disabled
   when choosing to invite via messaging, even though the other linked
   contact *does* have a phone number.
4. label users w/o email so it's clearer why they can't be selected

Also:

* Twitter share-image was too tall
