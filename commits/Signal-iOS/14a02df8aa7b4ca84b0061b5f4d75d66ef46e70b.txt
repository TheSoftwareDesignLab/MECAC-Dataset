Avoid a re-entrant read transaction configuring group call views

Previously, a status change for a group call member could result in
the view getting reconfigured, which would in turn reconfigure the
subview showing the member's avatar. However, this *also* had to
calculate how large the avatar should be, which depends on the size of
the view. If there were pending layout changes already, asking for the
size of the avatar would cause a re-layout for the most up-to-date
value, which would in turn reset the avatar view, which could result
in the avatar view opening another transaction to make sure its image
was up-to-date too.

The simplest place to break the loop is to have avatarDiameter return
the diameter for the view's current size, even if it is about to be
re-layout-ed, and when such a re-layout does occur the didSet on the
`frame` property will pass that information along to the avatar view
anyway.
