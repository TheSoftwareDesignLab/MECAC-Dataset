New Fingerprint Format

Rather than verifying eachothers keys separately, you now verify the
privacy with your recipient by sharing a single composite number or
QRCode.

This is a breaking change, in coordination with Desktop and Android.

UX
--

Fingeprint is no longer in line with identity key error. Instead you
have the option of going to the full-screen safety number verification
experience.

Overhauled fingerprint design
-----------------------------

* use same modal dismiss button as elsewhere
* remove fingerprint from settings.
* quick slide in animation vs slow fade
  * existing was painfully slow
  * blur effect is better metaphor for something slide over top
  * anyway there was a rendering glitch in the end of fade where
    underlying navbar would "snap" out

Also Fixed
----------
Always provide a name string for contact

* Centralize all the nil-checking
* Fall back to "unknown contact"

allow multi-line error messages
