IOS-674: Clamped fonts are not dynamic after moving out of the clamped range

Fixes a minor bug where fonts that are clamped lose their dynamic
behavior. Before, we would clamp fonts by creating a new font if the new
font's point size fell out of the supported range. Dynamic sizing is
only supported in a few cases, and creating fonts in this way would
disable dynamic sizing.

If Signal was launched in a clamped content size category, then the user
decreases their text size without quitting Signal, none of our dynamic
text would update.

Instead, we'll use UIFontMetrics. This does appear to support a max
point size, and will also maintain dynamic scaling behavior.
