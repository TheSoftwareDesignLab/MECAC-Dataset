Fix usage of USE_DEBUG_UI define.

Guard compilation of all DebugUI* classes with USE_DEBUG_UI instead of DEBUG and stop defining USE_DEBUG_UI whenever DEBUG is defined. Instead I defined USE_DEBUG_UI separately for Debug builds
in the project settings.

Benefits:
• can easily enable Debug UI for non-debug builds.
• allow use USE_DEBUG_UI in Swift files.
