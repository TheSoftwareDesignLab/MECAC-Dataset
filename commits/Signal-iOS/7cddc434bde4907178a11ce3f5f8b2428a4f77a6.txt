Simplify ChatListFilterControl with independent isTracking property

By using `isTracking` to control explicitly whether content offset changes
should affect layout & animation progress, the `State` enum, layout, and
animation all become simpler.

Also fixes an issue where stopping the drag while the filter icon is partly
visible would stop adjusting the content offset, causing the filter icon to
momentarily appear stuck as the scroll bounce finishes.
