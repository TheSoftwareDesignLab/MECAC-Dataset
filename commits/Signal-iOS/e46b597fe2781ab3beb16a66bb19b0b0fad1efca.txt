Fix layout issue with link preview input UI on iOS 16.

On iOS 16 tapping on "Add Link" button in text story composer would result in keyboard appearing but no other UI visible. This commit fixes that issue.

This commit also fixes an issue where UI layout becomes somewhat broken during interactive dismiss of the sheet.
