Make crash-on-launch checking less aggressive

- Require two successive crashes-on-launch even for beta+internal users
  before showing the launch failure screen.
- Only count crashes before the "app is ready" checkpoint, not the
  "UI is ready" checkpoint. It's not clear how the latter interacts
  with background activity.
