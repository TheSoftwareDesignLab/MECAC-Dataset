Switch calls to low-bandwidth mode based on what RingRTC is using

Previously bandwidth limits on calls were based on a network
reachability check. However, in poor conditions, a call can switch to
cellular even though the phone is technically still connected to
wi-fi. This commit switches to checking what RingRTC reports as the
current network route and comparing *that* to the user's preferences.

There are two places where this falls down:
- when the call has just started
- if RingRTC can't tell what network interface is in use (which is all
  the time on iOS 11) and the user has "Use Less Data" on just for
  cellular

In both cases this falls back to the old behavior of checking
instantaneous reachability.
