Conventional naming for out custom PureLayout methods.

This moves methods more in line with PureLayout conventions.

- Methods always specify if they pin to an edge vs margin

- `margin` is a reserved word which should only refer to layout margins.
  i.e. do not use it to refer to "inset" and "offset".
