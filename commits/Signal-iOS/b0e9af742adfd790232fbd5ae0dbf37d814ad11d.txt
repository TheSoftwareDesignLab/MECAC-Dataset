Fix missing animation when sending a message

Prior to 6a7d6c0fae9f752a05e5220f7d606a393a0f9d33, this comparison used
`isEqual:`. However, none of the `LinkPreviewState` concrete
implementations provided `isEqual:` implementations, so it was
equivalent to pointer equality. After that commit, these types no longer
subclassed `NSObject`, so the equality check always failed.
