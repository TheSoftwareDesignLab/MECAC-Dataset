Fixing UX issue with unsynchronized clocks.

 TextSecure messages don’t get assigned a timestamp by the server. All
of it is done end-to-end between both clients. A client could have a
misconfigured clock or might want to forge a timestamp. Therefore, we
address this issue by introducing a new receivedAt timestamp for
incoming messages that will be used to sort the messages.
