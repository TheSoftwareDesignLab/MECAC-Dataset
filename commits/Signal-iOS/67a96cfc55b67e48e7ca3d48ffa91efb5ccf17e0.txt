Fix a few issues with badge expiration body text

The Boost case used `String(format:...)` even though there aren’t any
string replacements in the body text. We should avoid formatting strings
that don’t have format specifiers.

There was also a typo in the localized string key.

This also separates the monthly donation call to action string so that
it can be reused for gift badges.
