* Fix composition box size when switching threads.

Partial revert of 2c83046ff667d28944038d4d459efbbecb86a81e which
introduced a shared reusable message view controller across threads.

2c83046ff667d28944038d4d459efbbecb86a81e resulted in several discovered
bugs so far (#1179, #1150, #1152, and maybe: #1146). It's pretty clear
at this point we're going against the grain of how
JSQMesageViewController is intended to be used, and since the nominal
purpose of this feature (iPad Layout) doesn't exist, we should revert to
the known good way of interacting with the MessageViewController,
creating a fresh instance per thread.
