Update to allow re-use of code related to text overlays in photo editor.

• rename VAlignTextView to MediaTextView.
• rename ImageEditorPaletteView to ColorPickerBarView.
• move text style declarations from ImageEditorTextItem to MediaTextView because
  those would no longer be specific to image editor.
• extract TextToolbar from ImageEditorViewController to a standalone public class
  that is supposed to work in conjunction with MediaTextView.
