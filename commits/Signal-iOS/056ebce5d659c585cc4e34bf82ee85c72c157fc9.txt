Fix the image picker's dismissal animation of the collection view

The image picker was not quite dismissing a view but rather it was
restoring it to fill the screen's frame by updating the offset. This
change updates the frame.origin.y of the collection view's frame to
account for the height of the view's height. This gives us an animation
that pushes the view off-screen as we'd expect before the controller
removes the view altogether.
