Fix small visual bugs in group member sheet

This fixes two small regressions introduced in
80e8379738978f1e54c4ea3fa7f1ae3d69d3deec:

1. There's a bit too much spacing at the top.

2. In dark mode, the grabber had the wrong background color. (As you can
   see in the code, my solution here is a temporary workaround before we
   do a larger refactor.)
