Text stories UI improvements

* Allow to force "compact" style for a link preview view.

Link previews should be displayed in "compact" mode when there's a significant
amount of text.

* RoundMediaButton should never be allowed to be made smaller than its desired size.

* Improved layout for text stories: both composer and viewer.

There is now a shared UI layout logic between editor and viewer, editor being
a subclass of viewer.

New behavior for composer:
 • text view will grow in height as much as possible and becomes scollable
   when max height is reached.
 • link preview starts in "regular" layout (image above the text) and then
   is updated to "compact" layout (image on the left, text on the right)
   as text view grows.

New behavior for viewer:
 • updated font sizes for match spec.
 • for extra tall stories text label is scaled down to fit.

* Fix bug where Proceed button would stay disabled after composing a text story.

* Fix two UX issues reported in PR review.
