iOS 8 Fixups

* ContactsUI framework is not available on ios<9.
  And it never was, so this framework should not be "required".

* Fix conversation settings title font on ios8

* Fix fingerprint not displaying on ios8

* ios8 safety number indented on third line.

* Fix glitchy table cell animation (not ios8 specific)

  The defaut slide-under animation only looks good if you're using a
  standard table cell height, but our duration slider is taller than the
  rest of the table's cells.

  Plus add a little bottom padding to the slider cell
