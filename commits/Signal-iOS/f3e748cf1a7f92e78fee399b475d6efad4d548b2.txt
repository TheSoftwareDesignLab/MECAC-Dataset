Fix self-closing message action view on iOS 12

This code was probably intending to *focus* on the dismiss button, but
instead it *activated* the button, i.e. performed its action. On newer
versions of iOS, this was being ignored somehow, but on iOS 12 it was
actually dismissing the sheet right after it came up. Passing an
object to UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:) sets the focus
properly.
