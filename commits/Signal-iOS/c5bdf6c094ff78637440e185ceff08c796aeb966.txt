Improve subscription charge error UI

Currently, when your subscription expires due a charge failure, we
incorrectly tell you that it's due to inactivity. This fixes that, by
telling you about the charge failure.

This is a bit difficult to test on its own, so I:

- Faked out the smallest pieces I could in an effort to test states
  manually
- Created `BadgeErrorSheetState` which is pretty thoroughly tested
