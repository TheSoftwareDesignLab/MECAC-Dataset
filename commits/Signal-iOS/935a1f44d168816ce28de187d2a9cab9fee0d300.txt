Bug fix, pre-iOS 13 dark theme activity indicator was hidden

The fix: on pre-iOS 13 devices, select our activity indicator style
based on the Theme. On iOS 13+ devices, we'll use the new symbol that
does not specify a color.

Also, rename a method on ComposeSupportEmailOperation to be a bit more
swifty and fix a mispelled accessibility string.
