Fix broken layout after becoming active in landscape photo capture

repro:

1. screen protection enabled
2. phone in portrait
3. tap camera first capture
4. rotate phone to landscape
5. drag down systems notifications view
6. return to app
7. capture screen has the wrong orientation
7. sometimes capture screen has the wrong dimensions (portrait length applied to landscape side)

The issue is related to our screenlock window juggling. We typically enforce
orientation based on the main windows rootViewController orientation mask.
Previously this was almost always an OWSNavigationController which would
delegate its calls to one to a nav delegate or one of it's children view controllers.

We lost this when we switched to having the ConversationSplitViewController be our rootViewController
