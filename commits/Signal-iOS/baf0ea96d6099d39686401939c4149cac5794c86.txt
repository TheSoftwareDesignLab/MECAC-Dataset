Fixes [UIDevice isiPhoneVersionSixOrMore]

Improves the detection logic for iPhone 6 and above (uses interface idiom and the pixel width of the screen). This fixes detection on the iPhone 7 which was previously broken because it’s model number wasn’t include.

Also removes a number of category methods that weren’t being used in the codebase and were equally incomplete.
