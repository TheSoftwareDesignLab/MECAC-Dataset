Fix missing navbar for message details while searching

Seemingly a bug in iOS12.

When the search controller is presented, and configured to hide the navigation
bar during presentation, when another view controller is pushed, the pushed VC
does not have a visible navigation bar.

Note this affects any VC pushed while the search controller is presented - e.g. message details, long text view, contact VC, etc
