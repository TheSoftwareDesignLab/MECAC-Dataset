Scroll to bottom when switching albums

Fixes

1. start on "All Photos" which has many pages of content

You're at the bottom, as expected.

2. switch to "Video", which is much shorter

You're at the bottom, as expected.

3. Switch back to "All Photos"

Now you're unexpectedly in the middle of the content somewhere - at whatever
offset the "Videos" content height was.

Note that changes to "scrollToBottom". For some reason calling scroll to bottom
with infinity works fine initially, but subsequent calls hang. Because we only
used the "infinity" hack to account for the fact that we didn't have accurate
safeAreaInsets before `viewDidAppear`, we can accurately use safeAreaInsets
after that point (like here, when switching albums).
