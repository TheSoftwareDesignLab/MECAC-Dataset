IOS-815: Fix thumbnail scaling for link previews

We were using pixel size to determine if we should render a preview
attachment as a thumbnail or a large image. This was causing things like
Twitter avatars to be drawn large and blurry. Now, we compare based on
device scaling.

Also, adopts the LinkPreviewImageView for drawing thumbnails. This just
rounds the corners a bit. Ideally, the corner radius would match the
bubble, but that'd add a bit of plumbing. It's likely this code is going
to change a bunch in the future, so we'll just fix that then.
