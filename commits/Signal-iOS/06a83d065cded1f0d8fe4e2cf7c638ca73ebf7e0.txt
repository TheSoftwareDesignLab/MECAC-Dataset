Improves performance of launch jobs

Randall hit an issue where his device would take a few seconds to start
up. His logs indicate that his device is spending time running
LaunchJobs.

The first change here is to make sure we explicitly set the launch job
work at an ultra-high priority. This is okay, since we don't actually
present UI until after we finish these jobs. Running this work at
UserInteractive is appropriate since it quite literally prevents the
user from interacting with the app. There's also no other time-sensitive
UI work we need to be doing (like running animations) that we could be
contending with.

The second change is to add a bit more logging that allows us to monitor
the amount of work these jobs are doing. This will allow us to see if
these jobs are performing an excessive amount of work.

Finally, I moved these LaunchJobs to Swift. Mostly because the ObjC
implementations were block based. The additional code was going to
indent things further and our linter aggressiely indents blocks to begin
with. Moving this to Swift is much more readable.
