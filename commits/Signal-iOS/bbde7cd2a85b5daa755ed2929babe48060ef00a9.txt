iOS 9 Support

- Fixing size classes rendering bugs.
- Supporting native iOS San Francisco font.
- Quick Reply
- Settings now slide to the left as suggested in original designed
  opposed to modal.
- Simplification of restraints on many screens.
- Full-API compatiblity with iOS 9 and iOS 8 legacy support.
- Customized AddressBook Permission prompt when restrictions are
  enabled. If user installed Signal previously and already approved
  access to Contacts, don't bugg him again.
- Fixes crash in migration for users who installed Signal <2.1.3 but hadn't signed up
  yet.

- Xcode 7 / iOS 9 Travis Support
- Bitcode Support is disabled until it is better understood how exactly
  optimizations are performed. In a first time, we will split out the
  crypto code into a separate binary to make it easier to optimize the
  non-sensitive code. Blog post with more details coming.
- Partial ATS support. We are running our own Certificate Authority at
  Open Whisper Systems. Signal is doing certificate pinning to verify
  that certificates were signed by our own CA. Unfortunately Apple's App
  Transport Security requires to hand over chain verification to their
  framework with no control over the trust store. We have filed a radar
  to get ATS features with pinned certificates. In the meanwhile, ATS is
  disabled on our domain. We also followed Amazon's recommendations for
  our S3 domain we use to upload/download attachments. (#891)
- Implement a unified `AFSecurityOWSPolicy` pinning strategy accross
  libraries (AFNetworking RedPhone/TextSecure & SocketRocket).
