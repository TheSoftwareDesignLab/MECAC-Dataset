Clean up generated strings

Before this change, there were two issues.

First, `Localizable.strings` had old, unused values inside. This removes
them (by running `./Scripts/translations/auto-genstrings`).

Second, running that script revealed that some localized strings had
different comments:

```
genstrings: warning: Key "MESSAGE_ACTIONS_TOOLBAR_CAPTION_%d" used with multiple comments "Label for the toolbar used in the multi-select mode. The number of selected items (1 or more) is passed." & "Label for the toolbar used in the multi-select mode. The number of selected items is passed."
genstrings: warning: Key "ONBOARDING_2FA_INVALID_PIN_%d" used with multiple comments "Label indicating that the 2fa pin is invalid with a retry count in the 'onboarding 2fa' view." & "Label indicating that the 2fa pin is invalid with a retry count other than one in the 'onboarding 2fa' view."
genstrings: warning: Key "REGISTER_2FA_INVALID_PIN_ALERT_MESSAGE_%d" used with multiple comments "Alert message explaining what happens if you get your pin wrong and have one attempt remaining 'two-factor auth pin' with reglock disabled." & "Alert message explaining what happens if you get your pin wrong and have one or more attempts remaining 'two-factor auth pin' with reglock disabled."
genstrings: warning: Key "REGISTER_2FA_INVALID_PIN_ALERT_MESSAGE_REGLOCK_%d" used with multiple comments "Alert message explaining what happens if you get your pin wrong and have one attempt remaining 'two-factor auth pin' with reglock enabled." & "Alert message explaining what happens if you get your pin wrong and have one or more attempts remaining 'two-factor auth pin' with reglock enabled."
```

This fixes that as well.

(I presume this was introduced in
54b743de2d5c9eb2e46d12b5472807c0ab72ae42 but didn't check.)
