Apply theme to CVC after changing input toolbar.

When the theme changes (which occurs spuriously
when backgrounding and reactivating the app in
dark mode on iOS 15), CVC.applyTheme was called
before CVC.updateThemeIfNecessary. This caused
quoted replies to have the wrong appearance.

This commit changes the order so that the quoted
reply's appearance is always correct.
