Persist quoted replies

When you compose reply to a message but do not
send it, we would persist the text you entered but
would lose the quoted message to which you were
replying.

This commit adds support for persisting that
information.

ThreadReplyInfo is a new class that uses the
key-value store to associate a single optional
reference to a message with each thread.

The following behaviors are nw:
* When you enter the CVC the input toolbar is
  updated to have the quoted message.
* When you exit the CVC the quoted message is
  saved.
* When a thread is deleted, the quoted message is
  deleted.
