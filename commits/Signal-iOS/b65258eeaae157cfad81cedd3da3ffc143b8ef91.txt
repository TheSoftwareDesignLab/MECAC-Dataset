Fix chat deselect animation intermittently breaking

Something about calling UITableView.deselectRow(at:) in the transition
coordinator completion block was causing the deselect animation to
intermittently just fail and pop to the deselected state. By actually animating
alongside the transition, we can reliably animate the deselection, and also
animate it interactively.
