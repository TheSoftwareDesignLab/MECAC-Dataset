Use built-in date formatter when formatting lossless durations

Previously, `String#formatDurationLossless` rolled a custom formatter.
Now, it uses `DateComponentsFormatter`.

See also: the tests in `Signal/test/util/StringAdditionsTest.swift`,
which were untouched as part of this change.

I think this is a useful refactor anyway, but it should also fix rare
RTL bugs where duration components would be backwards. (I don't think
this ever happened under normal conditions, but it could happen if a
disappearing messages timer was set to something unusual like "1 day, 3
hours".)

I also plan to build off of this for an upcoming change, which is why
I did this now.
