Simplify reasoning around disappearing messages

1. Max duration between runs is now a separate timer we set up once and
   don't touch, so we can separate any potential bugs in scheduling logic.
2. When we want to "run now" we just run now, rather than going through
   the scheduler.
3. Detect if messages aren't being deleted in a timely way.
