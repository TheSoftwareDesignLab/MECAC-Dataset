Better multisend of text stories

* Shuffle code around, adding UnsentTextAttachment

* Replace usages of TextAttachment with UnsentTextAttachment where applicable, creating an actual TextAttachment (and associated OWSlinkPreview image TSAttachment, if applicable) only per-recipient

* Only upload one text story link preview image attachment and propagate it to the individual TSAttachments created for each destination

* update comments so I don't lose my mind the next time I read this code

* Dedupe text stories sent to the same person via multiple private threads

* fix non-compiling tests
