Explain send failures for text and media messages

fixes #1231

Motivation
----------
Previously when messages failed to send, there was no reason given.
Furthermore, when media messages failed to send there was no indication
that any attempt to send the message even occurred, nor a retry
dialog.

UX Changes
----------
- Show "uploading" status for media
- Show specific error message in retry-send dialog
- Only scroll to bottom when new message is inserted
- Show specific errors when group creation fails

Code Changes
-----------
- Updated incorrect references to TSMessageAdapters which were actually
  references to OWSMessageData
- MessageSender was extracted from SSK MessagesManager
- access MessagesManager as property
- idiomatic init/properties for Env
- log contact intersections
- Move scroll-to-bottom animation to main thread.
