Disable `insetsLayoutMarginsFromSafeArea` in RoundMediaButton.

This is done to prevent incorrect layout when moving buttons off-screen
in ImageEditorBottomBar.

All instances of RoundMediaButton always have a fixed size and there are
no cases when it would be necessary for button's layoutMargins to include
safe area (which is inherited from the superview).
