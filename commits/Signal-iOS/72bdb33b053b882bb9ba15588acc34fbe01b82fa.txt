Set CVBodyTextLabel's contentMode to redraw on bounds changes

This is a quick workaround for a behavior change in iOS 15.4 that's
causing CVBodyTextLabel to draw stretched or truncated text due to
cell reuse---the text is drawn in the cell's old size (which may be
insufficient, truncating the text), then the size changes and the
content that *is* drawn is potentially stretched.

Credit to Martin for finding this; I just profiled it to make sure it
wasn't going to be prohibitive.
