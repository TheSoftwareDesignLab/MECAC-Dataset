Initial work to depend on external futures library instead of internal implementation

Still need to:
- Fix indentation
- Check for any FutureSource being returned instead of FutureSource.future
- Check for then: vs thenTry: mixups
- Check for main thread related issues
- Check for other exception catching issues
- Adjust directory layout
- Manual end-to-end testing
