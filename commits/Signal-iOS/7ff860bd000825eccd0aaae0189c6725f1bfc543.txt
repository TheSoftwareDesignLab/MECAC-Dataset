Couple leftover bugs from the onboarding changes

- PIN setup copy needs to be left as-is. So we'll go back to our old
  pinned font behavior. Design is aware of this and looking into better
  support for dynamic type.
- Profile creation should present keyboard
- Re-add animated presentation of profile settings page
