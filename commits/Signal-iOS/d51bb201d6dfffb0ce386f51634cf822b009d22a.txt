Reuse cover views when rebuilding sticker management table

Creating fresh cover views resets the animation playback and causes
weird flicker. If we just cache the views that we're already using then
we can avoid the flicker.

Eventually we should move this table towards reusable cells, but until
then, reusable image views will have to do.
