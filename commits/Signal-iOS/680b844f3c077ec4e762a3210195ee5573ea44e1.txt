Allow all windows to do landscape, fixes:

1. Remove undesirable animation from portrait->landscape when minimizizing in
   landscape and relaunching in landscape.

2. This also seems to fix the intermittently misplaced toolbar when launching
   in landscape. I believe this is a consequence of fix #1
