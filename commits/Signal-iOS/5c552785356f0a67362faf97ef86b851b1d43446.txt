Tweak copy for expired Boost badges

If your Boost badge expires but it's not your primary badge, our current
text doesn't make perfect sense.

After some discussion, we settled on the following copy change:

```diff
-Your Boost badge has expired and is no longer visible on your profile.
+Your Boost badge has expired and is no longer available to be displayed on your profile.
```
