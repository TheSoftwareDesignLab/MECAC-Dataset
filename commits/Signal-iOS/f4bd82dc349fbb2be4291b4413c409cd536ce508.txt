Use solid color for "selected" background color of UITableViewCell.

revious color was semi-opaque black which meant the resulting color of a selected UITableViewCell's background was not something referenced in the code. Therefore it wasn't easily possible to re-use the color for non-UITableViewCell elements (e.g. creating UIButton whose colors should match UITableView's colors). With the opaque colors final color of the background of a selected cell is known and can be referenced directly.

Also removed Theme.tableCell2MultiSelectedBackgroundColor - use one color for both "single" and "multiple" selection modes.

Fix Calls tab not setting UITableViewCell properly to use custom cell background color in multi-select mode.
