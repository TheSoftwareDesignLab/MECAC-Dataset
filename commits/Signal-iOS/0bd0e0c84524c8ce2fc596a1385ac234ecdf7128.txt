Fixes for incorrect UI state in chat screen bottom panel. 

Fix 1. UIScrollEdgeElementContainerInteraction appears to switch our chat bar buttons into dark mode. The fix is to not specify a dynamic color for button icons, but a resolved one from Theme.
Fix 2. UIScrollEdgeElementContainerInteraction does turn bottom input-blocking panels (like the "only admins can send messages") into dark mode too. The fix is to add UIScrollEdgeElementContainerInteraction not to the whole panel, but only to chat search results toolbar, message selection toolbar and chat input toolbar individually - potential subviews of the panel.
