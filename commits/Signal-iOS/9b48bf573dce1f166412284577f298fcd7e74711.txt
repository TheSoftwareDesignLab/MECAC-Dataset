Don't deallocate UIViewPropertyAnimator until completion handlers run

UIViewPropertyAnimator asserts when deallocated after it has already scheduled
an animation completion handler on the current runloop. Adding an explicit
completion handler to do the clean-up should ensure the animator isn't
deallocated too early.
