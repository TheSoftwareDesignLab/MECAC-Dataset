Fix message for an ongoing group call with three people

There's no reason to special-case "three" vs "four or more" in our
current format (rather than using "three or more"), and in fact the
"three" case wasn't using correct English (it was correct in the
PluralAware table, though). Update both the in-call title text and the
conversation item to use the PluralAware "many" version for "three or
more" people in a call.
