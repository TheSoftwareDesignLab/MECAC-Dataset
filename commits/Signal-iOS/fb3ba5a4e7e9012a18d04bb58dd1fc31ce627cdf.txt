IOS-574: Avoid unnecessary database read transactions in -updateLastVisibleSortId

This change improves the performance of unread message tracking and
collocates code that configures the scroll down button

Before, a block was asynced back onto the main queue to take out a read
transaction. This was a fairly hot path, occurring on
-scrollViewDidScroll:, a 100ms timer, etc. This transaction was usually
not useful since unread count updates only occur sparingly.

This change breaks out unread message count updates into a separate
method. When updating lastVisibleSortId, the unread method will only be
called when it appears that we may moving from the unread -> read state.

This adds a couple other minor changes:
- Minor reconfiguring of some properties (e.g. making a property
  readwrite, renaming a getter, etc)
- Leverages a custom setter to automatically reconfigure the
  scrollDownButton on relevant changes
- Moves all repeated view configuration of the scrollDownButton into a
  single method
