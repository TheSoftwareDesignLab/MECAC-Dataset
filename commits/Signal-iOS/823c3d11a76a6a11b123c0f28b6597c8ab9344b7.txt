Fix Screen Lock error when no passcode is set

In abf556fb7aa07019620b69d5cd366ae189e4b176, we passed all presented
view controllers to the app’s main UI. However, screen lock errors don’t
immediately dismiss the screen lock UI, so they weren’t ever shown.

In 6ca4bfeff95b3942ec43cf8b4bb91637574edb3c, we adopted the new limited
photo picker APIs, and manually presenting the photo picker allows us to
specify the view controller from which it should be presented. That
eliminates the root cause that necessitated the workaround.
