Group calls: separate new/existing member safety number notifications

We've been presenting all safety number mismatches as "someone joined
the call you were already in", but sometimes they were in the call
first. In that case, we should use a different message.

While here, make these messages a little more concise so we can fit in
an explicit "Tap to view", to encourage people to come back to the app
and decide whether they want to stay in the call.
