Tapping corrupted message opens "session reset" activity

This action was previously hidden under a secret longpress gesture in
the fingerprint view controller.

Ideally we'd never receive corrupted messages, but at the point we do,
our sessions are out of whack, and the only recovery option is to reset.
Let's help our users do that.

* Resetting session sends END_SESSION message

  Otherwise the remote side wouldn't know we reset the session and will
  send us a message on the old ratchet.

* Don't reset their identity key when resetting sender ratchet.

* Updated translations
