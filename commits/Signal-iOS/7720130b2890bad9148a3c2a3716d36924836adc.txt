A whole bunch of UI enhancements:

- Tuned colors to more closely match design spec
- Made changes to support dynamic theme updates
- Made some changes to support dynamic text sizing
- Attached some button actions that hadn't been hooked up yet
- Better handling of cases where we can't send emails (e.g. user doesn't
  have a mail account configured)
- Better handling of cancellation during log upload. Before, we'd
  continue to open the mail URL anyway
- Adopt ActionSheetController over UIAlertController

Also, our clamped fonts now support dynamic size adjustments. Before,
we'd return non-dynamic fonts clamped to a given size. Now, we use
UIFontMetrics to give us automatic adjustments on size category changes.
