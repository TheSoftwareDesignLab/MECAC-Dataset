Disappearing Messages

* Per thread settings menu accessed by tapping on thread title

  This removed the toggle-phone behavior. You'll be able to see the phone
  number in the settings table view.

  This removed the "add contact" functionality, although it was already
  broken for ios>=9 (which is basically everybody).

  The group actions menu was absorbed into this screen

* Added a confirm alert to leave group (fixes #938)

* New Translation Strings
* Extend "Add People" label to fit translations.
* resolved issues with translations not fitting in group menu

* Fix the long standing type warning where TSCalls were assigned to a TSMessageAdapter.

* Can delete info messages

  Follow the JSQMVC pattern and put UIResponder-able content in the
  messageBubbleContainer. This gives us more functionality *and* allows us
  to delete some code. yay!

  It's still not yet possible to delete phone messages. =(

* Fixed some compiler warnings.

* xcode8 touching storyboard. So long xcode7!

* Fixup multiline info messages.

  We were seeing info messages like "You set disappearing message timer to
  10" instead of "You set disappearing message timer to 10 seconds."

  Admittedly this isn't a very good fix, as now one liners feel like they
  have too much padding.

   If the message is well over one line, we were wrapping properly, but
  there's a problem when the message is *just barely* two lines, the cell
  height grows, but the label still thinks it's just one line (as evinced
  by the one line appearing in the center of the label frame. The result
  being that the last word of the label is cropped.

* Disable group actions after leaving group.
