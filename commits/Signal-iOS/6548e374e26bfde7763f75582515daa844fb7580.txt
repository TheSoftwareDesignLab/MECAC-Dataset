Improved crop tool in media editor.

Re-do all crop view controller with pure Auto Layout which allowed to animate layout changes and transitions between UI states.

Image rotation using two fingers was removed to match native Photos app: tilt control UI at the bottom allows much more precise rotation and two finger gesture is now purely for zooming and panning.
