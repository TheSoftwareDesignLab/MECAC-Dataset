Adopt UIContextMenu style preview interactions

iOS 13 added support for peek/pop style interactions on non-force touch
devices. ViewControllerPreviewing has been deprecated and replaced with
UIContextMenu.

This change adopts the new API on iOS 13+ devices. iOS 12 force touch
devices will continue to support the old style behavior. This also
enables support for haptic touch/long press interactions on devices that
do not support force touch.
