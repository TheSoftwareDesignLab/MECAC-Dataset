Resign custom donation amount field responder when changing currency

We do this for two reasons:

1. We'd like the form to be cleared when you come back--nothing should
   be focused.

2. Without this, the "hey, I've been focused" event will fire, which
   will clobber the currency you chose. The events will be:

   - User taps the custom donation amount text field
   - User taps to change the currency and selects it
   - The state is updated to reflect the new currency (correct)
   - Very shortly afterward, the text field is re-focused, causing the
     state to be updated, and back to the old currency (incorrect)

This fixes both things with one change. (There might be a more elegant
way to solve the 2nd problem if we wanted to address by itself.)
