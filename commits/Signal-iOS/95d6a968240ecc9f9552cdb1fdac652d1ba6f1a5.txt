Update checkmark in chat picker from media sharing flow to match other views.

ConversationPicker shared checkmark asset with media editor toolbar. The
checkmark was a little bit too small, also checked and unchecked indicators
had different size.

This commit updates ConversationPicker to use the same checkmark styling
that group UI has.
