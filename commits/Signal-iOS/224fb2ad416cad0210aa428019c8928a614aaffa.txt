IOS-696: Changes to title in OWSTableContents after -loadView not handled

Fixes a minor bug that I discovered while playing with the support
flow. Navigation titles weren't showing up in the new view controllers.

It seems OWSTableViewController was only reading an OWSTableContents
title during -loadView. My first pass at the support flow's view
controllers overrode the -contents property, so this was working
originally. Later, I started setting -contents during -viewDidLoad which
is too late for OWSTableViewController.

Now, OWSTableViewController will update the title any time the
OWSTableContents changes and there's a non-zero length title provided.
