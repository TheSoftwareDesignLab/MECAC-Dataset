Check whether recipient is blocked before adding gift badge send job

If someone makes it to the confirmation screen with a blocked contact,
we should try to stop them. Specifically, we check for blocked state (1)
when the Apple Pay button is pressed (2) right before we add a gift
badge job.

Note that [the gift badge job already checks this][0], too—this is just
helpful for the UI.

Tested this by trying to send a gift to a blocked contact, and also
trying the "happy path" of sending a gift to someone I hadn't blocked.
Both worked as I expected.
