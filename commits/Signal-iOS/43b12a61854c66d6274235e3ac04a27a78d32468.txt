IOS-840: Emoji reaction picker truncating some emojis

This fixes an issue where some emojis in the emoji reaction picker are
truncated and replaced with an ellipsis.

This only occurs on certain devices and I haven't been able to repro in
the simulator. A couple devices I've seen this occur on:
- iPhone X running iOS 13.6 and 13.7
- iPhone SE 2 running iOS 14b5

The issue has something to do with the typographic box for certain emoji
glyphs having a slightly larger size than most other emojis. The actual
glyph seems to have the same size. Many of the broken emojis have a ZWJ,
but there are some correctly sized emojis that also have a ZWJ.

The emojis that I've used for testing are:
- 👩‍🦰 (Woman + ZWJ + Red Hair)
  Typographic size: 36.00x38.19. Image glyph size: 32.00x32.00
- 👱‍♀️ (Blond person + ZWJ + Female)
  Typographic size: 40.00x38.19. Image glyph size: 32.00x32.00

To workaround this, we set the line break mode on the emoji label to
clip. On devices that don't have this issue, nothing changes. On devices
that do have this issue, we end up clipping a bit of the typographic
rect. In testing, it seems that we never end up clipping the actual
glyph image. But even if we do, it's at least better than truncating.
