CallKitIdStore: traffic in threads rather than addresses

This will be the interface used for storing IDs of group calls in the
future; for now there should be no functionality change, except if
there's an address mentioned with no associated thread. Previously
that thread would be created if needed; now the call action will fail.
This seems reasonable given that threads only go away if the user
explicitly deletes them.

While here, we don't need to save both the UUID and phone number of a
user's address; the UUID always wins anyway. Only worry about phone
numbers if there's no UUID.
