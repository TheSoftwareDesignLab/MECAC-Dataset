Improved appearance for text on colored background in text story composer.

Also in photo editing UI - for text overlays.

Previous implementation used NSAttributedString's ability to set text background
color. Appearance wasn't impressive though as there wasn't a way to add padding
around the text or round corners for the background.

New approach is to add a rectangle background underneath the text - which
story viewer was already doing.
