Update Donation UI to handle inactive/failed payments

The Donations screen doesn't currently handle backend
subscription failures well. An example of this is when
the backend encounters a repeated payment processing
failure. Currently, in these situations the donation
screens will display an active donation along with the
renewal date.

To remedy this, the UI now checks that the subscription
status is 'active' before displaying any of the
active subscription UI.
