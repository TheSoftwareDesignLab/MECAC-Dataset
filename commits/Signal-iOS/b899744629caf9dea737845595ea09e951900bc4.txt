IOS-842: Improved link preview thumbnail scaling

This relaxes the thumbnail size requirements on 3x devices. It also pins
the minimum thumbnail size to the width of the message bubble.

To prevent us from inadvertantly scaling down what would be a hero image
to a thumbnail size, this change also increases the max dimension of any
fetched link preview thumbnail.
