Fixes some name collision bugs

- Fixes up content alignment issues from parallel changes to table view
  styling.
- Re-adds view controller presentation within a nav controller (stemming
  from parallel changes to table view styling)
- Fixes a bug around overzealous collision detection

Also fixes an unrelated issue. Setting up cv banners performs layout, which
can cause the conversation view controller's trait collection to change.
This can lead to us reenterantly setting up banners and updating trait
collection.

The workaround is to just call -ensureBannerState asynchronously from
-traitCollectionDidChange to break the synchronous chain.
