Expand link preview vertically in composer if user deletes text. 

In text story composer, link preview might be collapsed to "compact" layout 
after user enough text so that there's no more vertical room for both text 
and link preview.

This change improves composer behavior to expand link preview back to 
"regular" layout if user deletes some or all text and there's now room for both.
