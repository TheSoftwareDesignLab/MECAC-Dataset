Pretty-print symbolicated crashes

This passes the `--pretty` flag to the symbolication script, which
slightly improves readability.

I also switched the flags to their long forms (`--output` instead of
`-o`, for example) because I feel that they're more readable. But that's
stylistic, and shouldn't affect the functionality of the script.
