Various design and UI consistency improvements.

• updated iconography
• lines and sizing
• empty inbox and archive screen with wording
• bug fix on calling to self being enabled sometimes (doesn't crash either way, but makes little sense)
• call icons and group update icons incorporated (PR to JSQ must be merged to test; this will be two lines on the Signal-iOS side to remove if we decide not to go with icons)
• fingerprint screen working: accessible by long press from contact screen on contact title. long press on lower half of screen shreds key material after confirmation. new icons for scan and show.
• short press on contact title will show their phone number
• color updates to new palette for green, yellow and light blue
