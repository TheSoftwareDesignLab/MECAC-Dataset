Re-worked in-app camera internals.

• Disable video stabilization (both on capture preview and video recording connections). Stabilization is causing a significant video stream latency, which resulted in last ~1.5 seconds of video not being written. The other thing stabilization was causing was zoomed-in camera preview. With stabilization off in-app camera now has the same FOV (in both preview and recorded video) as native camera app in Photo mode.
• Use a separate AVCaptureSession for capturing audio. This prevents a visible stutter in video stream at the beginning of video recording as audio input is added.
• Use separate dispatch queues for processing video and audio samples. This is again done to minimize a chance of any stutter during recording.
• Redo the way duration of video recording in progress is displayed in the UI. Old solution was to use a timer initialized at video recording start. New solution is to send actual recorded duration from the video recording stack all the way up to the UI.
