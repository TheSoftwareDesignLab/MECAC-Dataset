The goal of this commit is to build a "skeleton" UI for sending gift
badges.

It's totally possible that I haven't anticipated future changes
correctly, but my goal was to have each future change be a separate,
unrelated commit. For example, we need some logic to determine whether a
recipient has the "giftBadges" capability. That can be done separately
from the commit to send the badge message.

I also added "TODO (GB)" in these spots.

As with many other badge gifting tasks, this is behind a disabled
feature flag, so it should have no user impact.
