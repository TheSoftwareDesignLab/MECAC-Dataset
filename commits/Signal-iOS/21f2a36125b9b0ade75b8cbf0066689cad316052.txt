Add skeleton credit/debit card donation support

This adds very basic support for donations via credit/debit card. It's
missing important features which is why it's behind an internal-only
feature flag.

At a high level, this adds a new screen with a card form. This card data
is submitted to Stripe and then uses the same "rails" as our existing
Apple Pay donations.

This change is missing a few important features, intended to be added
soon:

- [3D Secure][3DS] support
- Validation error messages
- Input formatting (e.g., "1234" becomes "12/34")
- Gift badge support (currently only supports Apple Pay)
- Various smaller UI changes
