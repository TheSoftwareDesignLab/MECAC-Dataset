Add IDE template macro for consistent headers

Xcode has undesirable default header comments, and now you can customize them.
This adds an `IDETemplateMacros.plist` file to the `xcworkspace` so that new files created
in the workspace have the same, consistent default header comments automatically added:

```
//

//
```

This will prevent contributors from either (1) committing Xcode's default, or
(2) having to manually copy-pasta the standard comment headers for every new file added.
