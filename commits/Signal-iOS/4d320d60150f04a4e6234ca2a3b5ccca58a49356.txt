Unfork JSQMessagesViewController

Geting back on upstream fixes a couple bugs (see ##Bugfixes), and also
will make future updates easier.

The unforking process was basically this:

* move custom message types (Calls and DisplayedMessages) classes from our
  custom JSQMVC fork into Signal-iOS.
* Move any method customization into our subclass. Including
  ColletionView stuff, bubble sizing, and gesture behavior

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fix mis-sized incoming media bubbles.

Bubble size was being cached by interaction id. Which broke when
receiving an attachment. The problem is that incoming media messages
were initially the height of a "Downloading Attachment" info message.
Instead we use the mediaHash for media messages to expire the bubble
size when the media changes.

* fix missized bubble when MVC did appear

The MessagesViewController isn't sized correctly until ViewWillAppear.
This caused the first round of bubbles to be rendered incorrectly (they
assumed a larger container than they had).  I think is reflected in the
current version of the app by a reflow occurring shortly after the view
appears.

Chores
------
* bump travis to build with xcode8
* specify RQV development team for device build. required by xcode 8 beta

Cleanup
------
* Refactor messageing XIB so that elements are hangning outside of
  the views frame
* Fix compiler warning with explicit cast
* delete deprecated lineBreakmode, it's the default value anyway.
