OWSChatConnection: Recreate ChatService for each connection

This is closer to how OWSChatConnectionUsingSSKWebSocket worked, and
also the direction libsignal is going (a later release will introduce
LibSignalClient.ChatConnection to replace ChatService). This removes a
distinction between two kinds of socket cycling that
OWSChatConnectionUsingLibsignal had previously introduced, and
collects most of the state management and updates into one place. It
*does* rely on setting the chat listener at a point *after* the
initial connection has completed, which helps to ensure the order of
events when callbacks start coming in.

This commit does not touch the shadowing connection, which for now
continues to reuse a single ChatService instance.
