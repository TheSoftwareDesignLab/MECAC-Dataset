A lighter touch for the fix-call connect.

Though it should be fine, reloading the callUIAdapter is a bit heavy
handed. And the current implementation is prone to being broken, since
we sometimes forget not to treat callUIAdapter as a singleton.

Longer term we can find a way to either: make callUIAdapter a true
singleton or possibly make callUIAdapter a private member of something
which *is* a true singleton.

Since we only *need* it to be reloaded the one time the migration runs
(or when a user changes settings which should be rare) it makes sense to
remove it from the happy path.
