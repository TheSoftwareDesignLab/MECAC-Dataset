Media Editor: fix an issue when Pen and Crop button might not be visible.

Repro steps:
* have an album of three media: the first two are static, the last one is a video.
* go to the video and tap into message text input to pop the keyboard.
* dismiss keyboard and swipe to the static image.

Expected:
Static image tools buttons to be visible.

Result:
Static image tools buttons not visible.

Issue is a very weird one and likely is caused by some obscure bug with UIKit / UIStackView.
