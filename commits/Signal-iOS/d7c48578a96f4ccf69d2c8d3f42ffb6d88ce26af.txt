Fix invite crashing without sms (#1192)

* Fixes "New Message" --> "Invite contact" exception for iPhone devices that do not support SMS messaging

* fix SMS invite on empty inbox

This code appears in two contexts - (1) in an empty inbox , where no other view
controller is presented, and (2) in compose interface where a
search controller is presented, and must first be dismissed.

* only check SMS sending ability directly, (not device model)

This is better because:
1. sometimes iPhones can't send SMS
2. Sometimes iPads/iPods can send SMS

* correct localization key

* bump build
