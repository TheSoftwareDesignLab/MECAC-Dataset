Fix an issue where message context menu would appear unexpectedly.

Delete the code that would allow "long tap to show context menu" gesture to be
recognized simultaneously with scroll view's pan gesture. That would cause
message context menu to appear whenever user would stop inertia scrolling with
a tap and keep the finger on the screen.
