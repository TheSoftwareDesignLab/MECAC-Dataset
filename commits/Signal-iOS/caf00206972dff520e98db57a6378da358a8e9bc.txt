Present CollectionPicker as child view

TODO:

-[x] establish parent/child relation
-[x] reconcile changes with collection picker delegate
-[x] present/dismiss animation
-[] animate title label
-[] hide (some?) bar button items when collection picker presented

Nice to have:

-[] crop child view top - so that it comes *up to* the navbar bottom, but
    doesn't go behind
