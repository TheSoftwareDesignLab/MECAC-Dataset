Show activity indicator if we don't have media keys

It's expected that we won't have media keys for a short duration after
connecting. Show a spinner for a few seconds before we present the error
state UI.

Currently this looks at the connectionDate. Really, it should be looking
at the time we first learn of a participant. That's coming next.
