New Selection design

- update selection asset for "selected" badge
- show "unselected" badge when in batch mode
- fix issue where selected check wasn't shown when:
    - batch mode disabled
    - tap image
    - tap "back"
    - now you're in batch mode
    - you *should* see the previously tapped item as selected
