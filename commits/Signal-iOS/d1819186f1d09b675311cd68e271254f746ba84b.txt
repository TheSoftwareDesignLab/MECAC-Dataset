Remove unnecessary tryToEnableGroupsV2 call

The only place we call this in production code ensures that all members
already support gv2. As a result, there’s no reason to try and enable
gv2 -- it’s already enabled by the time we reach this code.

There are a few places in the Debug UI that may be relying on these CDS
lookups. I’ve removed one of them since there are existing “clone as v1”
and “clone as v2” options that do nearly the same thing. In another
case, I’ve dropped a reference to a live, non-test account. The other
places in the Debug UI that use this method either construct invalid
phone numbers that will never pass a CDS lookup, or they explicitly
provide UUIDs, which would exclude them from performing a lookup.
