Minor UI fix for the review screen in media editor.

Long recipient name in the top right corner would not be faded at the
end upon initial presentation.
This was happening because subviews did not have their final frames at
the end of `layoutSubviews`.
The fix is to call method that updates fading on next run loop run.
