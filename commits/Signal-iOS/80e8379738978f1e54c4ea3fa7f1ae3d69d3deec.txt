Combine interactive sheet handle code, fix layout bugs

This makes two changes to `InteractiveSheetViewController` and its
subclasses:

1. Consolidate the handle (the little grabber at the top) code.
   Previously, if the handle was visibly inside the sheet (instead of
   above it), it was a bespoke view for each sheet. Now, they all use
   the same handle and the same code.
2. Some sheets didn't account for the handle, which meant that they were
   cut off a bit at the top. This fixes that in
   `InteractiveSheetViewController`, and therefore all subclasses.

This might mean that some sheets look _slightly_ different (or fixed!).
