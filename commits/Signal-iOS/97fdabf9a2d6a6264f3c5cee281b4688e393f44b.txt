Narrow the bubbles a bit. (#1269)

This is closer to the 2.3 version.

Seems like upstream sizing has changed since our JSQMVC upgrade. This wider size calculation makes sense if you're losing space to the avatar, but since we're not using avatars the full width bubbles can make the whole view seem a bit crowded when you have large blobs of text.
