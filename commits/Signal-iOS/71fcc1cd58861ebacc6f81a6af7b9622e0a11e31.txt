Ensure new-user schema migrations run

The "file exists" check doesn't work, because GRDB itself automatically creates
the database earlier on, so instead we inspect if any migrations exist in the
migrations table.

also removes a spurious main-thread check for a non-ui db accessor and renames
it to be more ergonomic.
