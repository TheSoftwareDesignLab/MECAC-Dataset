[JSQMVC] Fixes "floating" edit menu for narrow media items

previously, edit menu was only positioned correctly for text bubbles,
and centered for media bubbles.

It wasn't that noticable for images/videos since those usually extended
to the middle of the conversation view, but with narrower media bubbles
(like arbitrary attachments) this became a bigger problem.
