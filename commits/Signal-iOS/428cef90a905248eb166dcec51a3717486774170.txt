Fix activity spinner after deselecting a GIF.

IOS-2343

When `isSelected` is set to `false`, the `ensureViewState()` function is
called, but it doesn’t stop the spinner.

If the user returns to the GIF selection screen, the spinner will still
be spinning. (Note: If you scroll the GIF far enough off the screen for
`prepareForReuse()` to be called, and then if you scroll the cell back
onto the screen, the spinner won’t start again.)
