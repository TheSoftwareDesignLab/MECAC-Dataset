Don't highlight text bubble when long pressing adjacent to text bubble (#1281)

Previously, if you tapped in the white space adjacent to the text bubble,
the bubble would highlight. No menu was show or interaction made
available. This is confusing.

It was fixed upstream, so this was as simple as:

    pod update JSQMessagesViewController
