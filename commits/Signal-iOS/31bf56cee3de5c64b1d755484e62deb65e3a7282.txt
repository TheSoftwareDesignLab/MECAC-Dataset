Improve display of five call buttons at once

- On the smallest devices (iPod touch and original iPhone SE) shrink
  the spacing between the buttons in addition to shrinking the
  buttons, so they all fit on the screen with some margin to spare.

- On other phones, shrink the buttons but keep the full spacing
  between them. (This is the current behavior.)

- Never shrink buttons on iPads, which can afford and benefit from
  larger tap targets.

While here, let the call control stack views do some of the layout
work for us.
