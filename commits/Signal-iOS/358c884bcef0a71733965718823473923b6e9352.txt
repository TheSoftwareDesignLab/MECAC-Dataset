Don’t allow non-gv2 members in new groups

Right now, trying to add a non-gv2 member to an existing group will
present an error when selecting the row.

When creating a new group, we allow the row to be selected, and then we
show an error on the next screen. With this change, we’ll show an error
immediately when selecting the row. (This allows us to remove a few
hundred lines of migration UI that *should* be unused.)
