Fix `InteractiveSheetViewController` scrolling bug

Short story: we now properly decide whether the sheet is being resized
or scrolled, fixing the bug.

Long story:

Some users report that they can't scroll the forward message sheet
([example report 1][1], [example report 2][2]). This wasn't just a bug
with the forwarding sheet. It was a bug with all subclasses of
`InteractiveSheetViewController`.

When you gesture on the sheet, there are effectively two modes: "resize
the sheet mode", and "scroll the contents" mode. (See
`beginInteractiveTransitionIfNecessary` for a boolean that expresses
this.) The logic is effectively this:

    def getMode():
      if sheetHeight < maximumSheetHeight:
        # Note: there are some other ways to get this mode, e.g. by
        # grabbing the handle. But those aren't relevant for this bug.
        return "resize the sheet mode"
      else:
        return "scroll the contents mode"

Unfortunately, there was a bug in how we computed the max sheet height
if that height was larger than the height of the screen (e.g., in
landscape mode or on a shorter device). That bad height caused you to
get into "resize the sheet mode" incorrectly. This fixes that, and does
a few other cleanups.
