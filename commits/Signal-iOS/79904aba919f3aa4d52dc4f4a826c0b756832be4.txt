Group call "UI": don't wait for an outgoing ring that won't happen

When a group call's ringRestrictions and groupCallRingState got split
up, this switch wasn't updated. Consequently, joining an *existing*
call never showed the ring button, leaving groupCallRingState in its
initial state of "shouldRing". This in turn meant that both the
CallKit and non-CallKit UI adaptees never actually considered the call
accepted. Fix this by checking ringRestrictions when deciding whether
to wait for someone to respond to a ring.
