Use clipping to hide ChatListFilterControl content instead of an overlay

- Prevents ChatListFilterControl content from blending with the navigation bar.
- Properly "docks" ChatListFilterControl to the top of the chat list content
  area instead of allowing it to move with overscroll / bouncing during the
  pull-to-filter gesture.
- Fixes an issue where the overlay view could occasionally appear as a white
  bar covering part of the chat list.
