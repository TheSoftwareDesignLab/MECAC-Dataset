Fixes for media viewer open/close animations.

Remove spring bouncing for "close" animation (set damping to 1).

Fix visual glitches during "bounce" stage of media "open" animation - this was caused by animating masking layer's path. The issue is still there, but only for corner cases - media in chat with multiple rounded corners of different radius.
