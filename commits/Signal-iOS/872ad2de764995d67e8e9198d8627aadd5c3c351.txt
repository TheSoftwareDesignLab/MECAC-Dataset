IOS-362: new support flow

Most of the UI work for the new support flow. This still needs some
tuning, but I wanted to checkpoint some of this work. This adds a couple
new views and view controllers to facilitate the new support flow.

What's left to be done:
- Putting together the send-message infrastructure
- Attach actions to all of the buttons
- Make sure the colors all match up with the spec
- Reach out to design for feedback
- Testing with various accessibility settings
