Tweak Dismiss Animation

Make sure the background view controller is showing by presenting the camera capture over full screen context.
Remove swipe speed as a dismiss trigger -- it was too easy to accidentlly dismiss the camera capture view. If you're in the camera you don't want quick swipe to dimiss the view and maybe miss what you wanted to take a photo of.
Constaint dismiss animation to vertical and only dismiss downwards. Tweak the distance required to drag to enage the dismiss action.
