Fix unreadable search result highlighting

CVTextLabel incorrectly attempts to set default .font
and .foregroundColor on the label text, removing any
existing font & color attributes. This results
in unreadable text when displaying search results.

Instead, add helper method to set default attributes on
attributed strings, but only on ranges that don't have the
attribute already defined.
