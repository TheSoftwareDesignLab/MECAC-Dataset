Update text color adjustment behavior in photo editor and text story creation.

• text story composer now has three options: colored text with no background,
colored text on white background, white text on colored background.
• text/background color is switched to black if user chooses background/text
color close to white, to avoid white on white look.
• photo editor has three options from above + white text with colored underline.
