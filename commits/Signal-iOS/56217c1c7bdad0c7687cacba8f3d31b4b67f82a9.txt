Add methods for convert TimeInterval and Int into localized string.

• OWSFormat.localizedDecimalString(from:) would convert Int into
  a localized string using `decimal` style (preferred style for displaying
  in the UI).
• OWSFormat.localizedDurationString(from:) would convert a time interval
  into localized string like "HH:mm:ss", using current locale.
