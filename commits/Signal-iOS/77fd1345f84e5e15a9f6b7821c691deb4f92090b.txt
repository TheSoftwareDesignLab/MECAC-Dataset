Updates to Chat, Calls and Stories views. 

• use UIBackgroundConfiguration to configure background colors (normal, selected) for list rows in Chats, Calls, Stories;
this allows us to use background with rounded corners on iPads, as design team wanted;
• in Chats, use secondaryLabel color to show last message text, timestamp etc. instead of older color.
• in Chats, use system-provided horizontal layout margins for content instead of fixed 16 dp.
• update to use dynamic colors in all of those lists: assign color values just once, don't reload UI on light/dark mode change;
• switch to using UIColor.Signal.background for all those lists; this results in those views getting proper "elevated" background color when displayed in the Split View controller.
• use UIButton (instead of OWSButton) in Stories ("Save" and "Context Menu") buttons.
