MediaGallery: pin to the bottom when content insets change

If you're scrolled to the end, you probably want to stay scrolled to
the end rather than keep the same top position. This applies both when
the footer bar shows up (in multi-select mode) and when the scroll
view is initially loaded, fixing a bug where the bottom row is cut
off. Unfortunately, the latter fix does not seem to work on older
iOSs, but it doesn't make things worse either.
