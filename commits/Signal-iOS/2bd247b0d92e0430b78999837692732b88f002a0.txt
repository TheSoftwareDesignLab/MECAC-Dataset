Fix `measureLabel…` for attributed strings

The comment indicated that the existing fonts for particular subranges
should not be overwritten. However, the existing font was being
overwritten, which resulted in the measured size being too small.

The fix is to apply the default font only to ranges which don’t already
specify their own font (the intended behavior according to the comment).
