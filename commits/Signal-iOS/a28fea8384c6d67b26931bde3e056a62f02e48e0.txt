Fix emoji message truncation on iOS10

fixes #1368

Apple switched emoji fonts from AppleColorEmoji to AppleColorEmojiUI.
The new font doesn't compute it's size correctly, causing containing
rectangles to be too small.

This commit scrubs strings of the new emoji font, and replaces it with
the old.
