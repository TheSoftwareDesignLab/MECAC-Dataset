Format credit/debit card donation inputs

This formats the text users enter on the card donation screen. For
example, "4242424242424242" becomes "4242 4242 4242 4242".

It uses [the `textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)`
method of `UITextFieldDelegate`][0] to accomplish this, and implements a
helper that can handle all the cases (inserting, deleting, replacing,
pasting, and so on).

Tested this in an iPhone 14 simulator and on a physical iOS 12 device.
