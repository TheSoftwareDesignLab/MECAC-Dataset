Remove "Share" from edit menu

Showing the share UI conflicts with the conversation views
inputAccessory toolbar.

Specifically:

- the long press menu acquires first responder
- tapping share presents the activity view
- at this point, the input toolbar is hidden
- launching a share extension hides the activity view, presents the
  share extension (could be the Signal share extension or another app's
  share extension)
- the conversation view (which is rendered behind the share extension)
  regains first responder, causing the input toolbar to appear above the
  share extension

One fix would be to re-implement an interface similar UIMenuController,
which does not require mucking with the responder chain, but that's
going to be more involved.
