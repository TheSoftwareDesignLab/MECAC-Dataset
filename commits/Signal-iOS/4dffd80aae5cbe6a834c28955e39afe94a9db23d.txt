Shorten disappearing countdown description in message details

In adfda71472567b0057f99877e6a619553c0a09f3, we added a disappearing
countdown to the message details screen. It would say something like "6d
23h 58m 6s". Now it just says "6 days 23 hours".

I also reverted some stuff from that commit, because it's no longer
necessary.

Our UI now [matches Android][0].
