Simplify call privacy settings

We've long allowed users to configure what shows up in message
notifications:

- name: content (by default)
- just name (no content)
- generic notification (no name nor content)

Now we're dual purposing that setting to apply to calls. If someone
doesn't want to show names in the message notifications, presumably also
don't want that name showing up in the call log.

Also, since the earlier CallKit/iCloud issues had been addressed before
iOS11, we upgrade all iOS11 users to the more intuitive CallKit
interface.

Also: introduce "use system call logs" toggle when available. It will be
enabled by default, but we disable it for legacy users who'd explicitly
opted *out* of CallKit.
