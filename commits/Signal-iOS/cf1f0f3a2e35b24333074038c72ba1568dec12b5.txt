Skip "donation settings" screen if nothing's on it

Before this change, you could tap "Donate" and be taken to a screen that
had just one button: "Donate".

Now, you'll only see this screen if there's anything _else_ to do on
that screen.

For example:

1. User installs the app fresh.
2. User goes to the settings and taps "Donate". They're taken to the
   donate screen, not the donate _settings_ screen. They donate.
3. Later, they go to the settings and tap "Donate" again. They're now
   taken to the donate settings screen.
