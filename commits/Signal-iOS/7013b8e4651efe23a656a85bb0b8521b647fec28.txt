Fix “N views  M replies”

These two plural strings aren’t grammatically connected (such as in the
phase “sent 1 of 3 messages”), so there’s no need to pluralize them in a
single translation. We’re essentially displaying two entirely
independent strings side-by-side in the UI, so represent them as two
separate translations for simplicity.
