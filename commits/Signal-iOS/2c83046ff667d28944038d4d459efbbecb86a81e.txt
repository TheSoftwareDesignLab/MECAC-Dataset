Closes #990.

- Use single MessagesViewController. Goal: Being able to reuse that UI
for SplitViewController on iPad. Prevents unnecessary deallocations and
re-allocations.
- Remove custom archiving UI for default swipe right to left archive
action, like in iOS Mail.app.
- DynamicType for main view.
- Simplify API of MessagesViewController to prevent undefined behavior.
