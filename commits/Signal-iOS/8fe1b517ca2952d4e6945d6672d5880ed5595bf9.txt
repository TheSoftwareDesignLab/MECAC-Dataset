Fix inconsistent UI in the in-app camera.

Explicitly hide "Switch Camera" button if badged Done button is visible.
Previously Done button would just obscure "Switch Camera" button.

The following user actions would result in badged Done button visible
with '0' as badge value:
• open in-app camera, tap media library
• select one or more items and close media library picker
• tap media library again and unselect all previously selected items.
