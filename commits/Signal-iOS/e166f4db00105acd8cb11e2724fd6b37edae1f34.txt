Fix account deletion first responder hiccups

We're removing a view while it's first responder. This is causing all
sorts of weird behavior. Haven't gone too deep into what's going on, but
it's like the text field gets moved to a new window? But it's still a
subview of the stack view. It also doesn't show up in the view debugger.
Very weird.

This is definitely a bug on our end, but it looks like iOS 15 changed
some keyboard handling behavior and that's why we're only seeing this
now.

The fix: Use the same view for the entire lifetime of the view
controller so we don't get weird behavior from swapping out views while
it's the first responder.
