IOS-2104: Unable to download voice message

Fixes a couple issues with voice messages:
- Tap actions will now check to the attachment download state and
  perform an appropriate action. Downloaded messages play, downloading
  messages are cancelled, undownloaded messages are enqueued for
  download.
- Improved implementation of AudioAttachment equatability. Cells will
  now redraw when download state changes.
