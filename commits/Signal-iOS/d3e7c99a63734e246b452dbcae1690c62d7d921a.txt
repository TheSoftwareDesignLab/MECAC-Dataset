Attachment approval: cancel/confirm to top/bottom toolbars

- avoid double-submit by disabling after hitting send.
- Animate SAE dismissal as modal
  Requires hiding the load view
- attachment is centered in screen
- add gradient to ensure controls are visible
- Fix clamp constraints - I think this was a typo
  Otherwise we couldn't show an image which was 1" wide by 2" tall
- set max zoom, hide scroll indicators
- use media view
- slower panning feels right
- white send button
- can share GIF, static, and sort of video...
- Play button for attachment approval
  - move to image assets so we can use it in SAE
  - slightly larger button for full-screen approval view
  - don't launch redundant fullscreen UI for images when in approval view
- fix scrollOffset in AttachmentApproval
- consolidate view initialization logic in loadView and fix white background
- CR: more legible arithmetic
