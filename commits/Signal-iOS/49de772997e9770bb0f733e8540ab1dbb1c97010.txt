Fix slow reloading conversation view. (#1397)

Fix animation memory leak exacerbated every time you reload a
conversation with expiration timers.

Stop animation on cells that aren't currently being displayed. This is
relatively minor compared to the above, but still, no reason to waste
cycles.
