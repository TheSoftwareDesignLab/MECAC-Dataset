Add new translucentDark style for ActionSheets

Adopted in GroupCallViewController. This changes how
ActionSheetController is built to have a single backdrop view. In the
translucentDark style, this backdrop is a UIVisualEffectView.

Creates a new enum, Theme.ActionSheet, to track different color
behaviors for action sheet themes.
