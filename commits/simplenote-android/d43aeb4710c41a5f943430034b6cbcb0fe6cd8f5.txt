Re-apply the nightMode in NoteMarkdownFragment's onResume

First inflation of the webview may invalidate the value of uiMode, which means that when the app is launched from the widget, the webview may have the wrong theme.
 Re-applying the nightMode in onResume fixes the issue, as the activiy will be recreated if the uiMode value is different from the wanted one, and won't have any impact if it's already applied.
The issue https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37124582 explains this, and though it's marked as fixed, it's still happening, just like the commenters say
