Bugfix. Dark theme is now correctly applied in bottom sheets (#619)

* Fixes #618 and correctly themes the bottom sheets when dark theme is applied. However, this does not fix #613 and the `RecyclerView` showing the sharing app buttons displays incorrect text colors THE FIRST TIME ONLY, which is caused by the same issue in #613.

* Changed dark background color for bottom sheets to become identical to the dark colors of the dark theme
