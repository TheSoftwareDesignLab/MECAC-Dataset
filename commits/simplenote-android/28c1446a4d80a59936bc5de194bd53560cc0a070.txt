Moved network logic from fragment for account deletion

Moved network logic defined in a OkHttp.Callback from
PreferencesFragment to AccountNetworkUtils so it takes care of handling
the response. makeDeleteAccountRequest now uses an interface which does
not have the responsibility of dealing with network logic.
