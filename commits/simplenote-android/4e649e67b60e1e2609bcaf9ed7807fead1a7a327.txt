Initial commit of new app

Notes:

 * Uses API 10 as the minimum requirement
 * Should be built with API 17.
 * Uses ActionBarSherlock for ActionBar support for gingerbread devices.
 * Set up for basic master->detail navigation for tablet/large screen
support.
 * Started a README.md with some instructions on setting up the app to
build properly.
 * Older version of app is now in 'legacy' branch.
