Added the option `Auto` to the themes to use the Dark theme when it is night and the Light one when it is daytime (#584)

* Added `Auto` option to the themes menu

* Fixed app crash selecting the `Auto` option

* - Refactored themes making the framework define `Dark` as the night theme and `Light` as the day theme.
- Initial implementation of `Auto` theme option.

* Typo fix in a comment

* Changed `Auto` to `Automatic Daylight Mode`

* Extra space to run Travis-CI one more time. It does not make sense that a change in one string value will fail the build.

* Changed the option name to `Dark at night only`

* Added location permission request with an explanatory message upon denial so that the user knows about the 10am-6pm behaviour if the permission is not granted.

* Race condition bug fix: When selecting the `Dark at night only` theme for the first time, the theme sometimes gets updated before the permission is granted, leading to no visual change until you move to another activity. This is no longer the case. Fixed.

* Minor fix: forgot to update theme even if the permission is not granted. Fixed.
