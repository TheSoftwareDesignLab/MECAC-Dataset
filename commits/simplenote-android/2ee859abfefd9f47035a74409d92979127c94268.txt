Fixed many things for tablets:

* Activity is no longer restarted when rotated, instead a fragment is created and added in code. Fixes #52
* Saves last selected note when rotating and selects it again if you're on landscape. Fixes #47
* Added a placeholder view to the Editor Fragment to show when there are no notes or after you delete a note.
* First note is selected in list when changing to a different item in the navigation drop down.
