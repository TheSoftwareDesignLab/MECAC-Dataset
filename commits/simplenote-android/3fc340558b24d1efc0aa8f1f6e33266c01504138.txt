* Fixed rendering bugs when tapping on checkboxes.

* You can now see the checklist images in the note preview.

* Added CenteredImageSpan for icon alignment serenity.

* Fixed checklists in search results.

* optimizations (DRY)

* Added a menu item to insert a new checklist.

* Optimized imports.

* Fixed incorrect search highlighting, we need to compare to the plain text note content since that is what the match indices are using.

* Fixed some tests and added a new one for the checklist regex.

* Added a few more tests.

* Fixed movement method on links, and updated capitalization of constants.

* Wee whitespace cleanup.

* Version bump.

* Avoid using `setText` so that an infinite loop is not created. Instead, we can modify the EditText's Editable directly. This also made the code a bit simpler!

* Process checklists in `afterTextChanged`.

* Adjusted size of checklist drawable for hopefully easier tapping.

* Markdown preview should use plain text content.

* Matching up the checklist insertion behavior to the iOS app.

* Fixed issue where remote changes weren't being processed correctly when they contained checklists.

* Only check for checklists taps on ACTION_UP.

* Helped checkboxes be easier to tap on with a finger.

Updated editor checklists to use the preview line color.

* Adjust the cursor position if necessary after adding a checklist item.

* Selection could be -1, so use a max comparison with 0 to always get desired cursor position.

* Clear the focus of the edittext so that the keyboard doesn't show after tapping on a checklist item.

* Restore the current selection after toggling a checkbox.

* Fixed issue where trailing checkbox would be skipped due to a string length safety check error.

* Keyboard won't show when clicking on a checkbox. If the keyboard is showing, we restore the selection after processing the checkbox image swap.

* We can use getContext instead of a local property.

* Refactored `insertChecklist()` to support adding checklists to text selected over multiple lines.

* Fixed a warning about string concatenation.

* Changing behavior of autobullets to go to the beginning of the current line instead of adding a newline after pressing enter on an empty bullet list item.

* Don't cash the theme color id to fix coloring issues when switching themes.

* It's hip to be square!

* Cleanup!

* Fixing the tests.

* Show the insert icon when viewing markdown (but have it be disabled).

* Update icon tint color attribute to simplenote blue for dark style

* Revert "Update icon tint color attribute to simplenote blue for dark style"

This reverts commit f61e61b8e51be976563f6989bdd00b13726dbb6e.

* We should update the current cursor position every time the cursor changes. Fixes issue where autobullets would try to apply even if the cursor position hadn't actually changed.
