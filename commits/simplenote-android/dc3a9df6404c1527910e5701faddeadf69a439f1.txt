Added a no animation flag to the editNoteIntent, if the NoteListFragment is hidden, to ensure smoother animation when opening the note in its own NoteEditorActivity when transitioning from full screen landscape to portrait.

Otherwise, when on tablet landscape and on other devices in any orientation, the animation is there when the user clicks on a note to view in the note editor.
