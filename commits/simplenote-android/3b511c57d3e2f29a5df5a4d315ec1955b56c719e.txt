Fix loss of selected note when switching to/from tablet mode on Chrome OS (#515)

* Adding back code that didn't merge properly(?) from configuration change fix PR.

* Save and restore the noteId in the note editor fragment when on a large device in landscape.

* Always grab the noteId from the intent in onCreate() of NoteEditorActivity, so that we can properly reconfigure the app layout in onConfigurationChanged().
