add floating window setting (#8279)

* Set `disable-floating-window` in client ui, it shows enabled when
  option is enabled and has floating window permission.
* Remove ignore battery setting because not work on every device.
* When the phone orientation changes, make the Y coordinate change
  proportionally, when changing back, the floating window position is still the original one.
* Add custom client option `floating-window-untouchable` to make the
  click event pass through the floating window automically. Set it untouchable automically when transparency is 0.
* On my phone, floating window size 16 no works and 32 works, so keep
  the size range [32, 320]
