Fix new cm tab not replace the old persisted tab (#9127)

* This happens when after changing DesktopTab to StatefulWidget, 1.2.7
  and 1.3.0 have this problem.
* When `addConnection` in server_model.dart is called, the old closed
  client is removed, the client parameter of buildConnectionCard is new,
but client id inside Consumer is old.
* The only state in cm page is timer, its value is kept in test.
* There may be a better way to solve the ui update.
