Notification shortcut update

Remove notification shortcuts after notification is sent as per 3rd item under https://github.com/android/user-interface-samples/tree/master/People#shortcuts, to allow shortcuts to be cached.

Q: Will my shortcuts appear in the long press app launcher context menu?
A: They can depending on their rank, but if you prefer not having shortcuts appear on launcher you can remove the shortcut with ShortcutManager#removeDynamicShortcuts() or #removeAllDynamicShortcuts() after sending the notification. You can also rank other app shortcuts with higher ranking, so only those dynamic shortcuts appear on launcher.

Thanks for all your great work on this. I will push for making the API better for this. Thanks again and note that this pull request can be a throwaway and I just wanted to show at what point the shortcuts can be removed. I checked out the codebase, made these changes and was able to get this working on a flashed Android 11 device. Thanks again.
