[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5152 - Replace Focus icons with AC icons

Remove all menu icons which can be imported from AC
Some of the icons were also used in the old implementation of browser menu,
implementation which is not used anymore, so I decided to delete the implementation
