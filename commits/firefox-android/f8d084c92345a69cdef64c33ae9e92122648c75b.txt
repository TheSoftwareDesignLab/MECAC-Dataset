Bug 1807073 - Defer allowing touch event interception in NestedGeckoView.

SwipeRefreshLayout starts triggering a refresh whenever the user's scroll
gesture is upward if the initial scroll position at the top even after the user
scrolled down once. It is controlled by the code in
SwipeRefreshLayout::startDragging [1]. To disable this behavior
`requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false)` needs to be called conditionally.
