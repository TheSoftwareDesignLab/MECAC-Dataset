[fenix] No issue: remove unnecessary robolectric annotations.

Theoretically, this should marginally decrease the duration of our unit
test suite. In my testing, for 1 iteration each (i.e. noise is very
possible), the duration changed from 9m 32s to 8m 21s – a 71s
improvement.

To identify tests that were running with robolectric that didn't need to
be, I removed the @RunWith(FenixRobo... from all relevant files:
    sed -i '' "/@RunWith(FenixRobolectric/d" app/src/test/**/*.kt

I ran the tests and discovered which ones failed from the Classes tab of
the index.html test result file. Something like:
    tests = document.querySelectorAll('table')[3].querySelectorAll('tr');
    failureElements = tests.querySelectorAll('.failures');
    // TODO: extract the test names

Then I copied these results to a text file and compared them to all the
files that had robolectric test runners to figure out which ones still
pass:
    comm -1 -2 failures.txt changed_files.txt > robolectric_not_needed.txt

And undid the changes to the failing files:
    for i in $(cat robolectric_not_needed.txt); do git checkout $i; done

Then I removed the import statements on those files:
    for i in $(cut changed_files.txt); do sed -i '' "/import.*RunWith/d" $i; done
    for i in $(cat changed_files.txt); do sed -i '' "/import.*RobolectricTestRunner/d" $i; done
