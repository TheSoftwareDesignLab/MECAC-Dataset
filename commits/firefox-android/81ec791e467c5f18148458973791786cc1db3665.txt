[components] Add ExperimentsDebugActivity to service-experiments

This adds the first command, "updateExperiments" that will force the ExperimentsUpdater to update immediately.

- Adds doc section to README.md
- Adds export statement to AndroidManifest.xml
- Init Logger with a TAG more in line with how the rest of the component uses Logger
- Fix an issue that was preventing the debug activity from working correctly since it was attempting to do networking on main thread.  Had to use a coroutine to perform the update in the background.
