[fenix] Close https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/27320: Include testing regex to Google Maven allowlist

When running UI tests locally, we found that the
`android-device-provider-local` dependency is no longer available on
mavenCentral. Our dependency repository uses various regex to allow only
google dependencies to be fetched from Google Maven, but somehow these
did not include the test ones everywhere.
