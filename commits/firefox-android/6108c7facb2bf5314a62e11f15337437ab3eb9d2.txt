[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/21816: Filename in "Open" PDF dialog overflows screen

Changing the download file name length to the max allowed by AS (251 char, won’t compile if more; max would be 260 for latest windows versions, but generally it is 255), and changing the UI test to check if the long file name is fully visible.
Changing the downloaded dialog layout to properly display really long file names.
