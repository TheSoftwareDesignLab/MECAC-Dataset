[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/6528 - Evaluate Nimbus experiments in place

This continues the work from
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/pull/6444 and will ensure that
after a new Nimbus configuration is downloaded and persisted internally any new
call to check the variables of an experiment will operate on the newly updated
Nimbus configuration.
