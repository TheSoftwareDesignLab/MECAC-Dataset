[fenix] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/14009: Fix onboarding 'Sign in to Firefox' ripple effect (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/17169)

* Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/14009: Fix onboarding 'Sign in to Firefox' ripple effect

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/14009: Add 'onboarding_padded_background_color' instead of rely on OS theme/color

Both previous solution, '?android:attr/colorControlHighlight' and '@color/ripple_material_light' were using a OS theme attr or color, which caused problems. To fix it, we introduced a 'onboarding_padded_background_color' which manually define the ripple effect color of the onboarding manual sign in button.
