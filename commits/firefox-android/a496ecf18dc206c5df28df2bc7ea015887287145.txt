[focus] Handle null and empty Strings in stripUserInfo() (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/567)

Sometimes the WebView will have a null URL in onProgressChanged().
It seems safest to update the url to be empty in this case, in
case the website is doing some spoofing-related tricks. We'll
hopefully get more feedback on what pages cause this soon.
