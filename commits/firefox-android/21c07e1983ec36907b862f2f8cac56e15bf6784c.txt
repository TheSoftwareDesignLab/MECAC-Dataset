[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/6244 - Update pending intent flags
Since Android 12 we need to set PendingIntent mutability explicitly, but Android 6 can be the
minimum version
This additional requirement improves your app's security.
All pending intents are updated to contain also the flag FLAG_IMMUTABLE when the version of
Android SDK is bigger than 30
FLAG_IMMUTABLE -> Flag indicating that the created PendingIntent should be immutable.
