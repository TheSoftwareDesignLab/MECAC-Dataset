Bug 1851268 - Show Firefox Suggest search suggestions in Fenix.

This commit integrates the Firefox Suggest Android component added in
bug 1850296 into Fenix, and adds:

* A Nimbus feature for Firefox Suggest.
* A secret setting to enable the Firefox Suggest feature, only visible
  on the debug channel.
* Search settings for toggling sponsored and non-sponsored suggestions,
  only visible when the Firefox Suggest feature is enabled.

When the feature is enabled, Fenix will ingest new suggestions in
the background, show the new Search settings, and show matching
suggestions in the awesomebar depending on those Search settings.
