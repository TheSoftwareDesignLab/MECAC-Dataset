[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/5006: Add RemoteTabsStorage to storage-sync

The tabs engine `sync` method signature needs to be different than
the one currently defined in `SyncableStore.sync`.
`StorageSync` is the only user of the interface method and is deprecated
already.
This patch removes the `StorageSync` class and makes the store `sync`
methods not inherited from any interface.
