[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/828: Fullscreen mode doesn't use entire screen

When we add the fullscreen view into the FrameLayout, we were taking the
original WebView and hiding it with View.GONE which doesn't take up any
layout space. View.INVISIBLE doesn't show the view, but continues to
use the space that it would if it did exist (drawing in the background).

For websites like YouTube and BBC.com/ideas, the video provided to us
was of a smaller size and resolution so it didn't take the fullscreen
and ended up shrinking to it's original size view size. 🤦
