[focus] Add keys to preferences, intialise with default values at startup (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/20)

Defining the actual keys separately means we can reuse that definition
when reading preferences in code. We need to provide a default
value for every key so that they are correctly initialised during startup.
