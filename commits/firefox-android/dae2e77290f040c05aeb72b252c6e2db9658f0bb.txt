[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/7324 - Apply cfr nimbus feature from the first run

initialization is too early
Replace nimbus api with initialize because api will be deprecated
Clear nimbus cache only at fresh install
Record experiments fetching time only at fresh install
