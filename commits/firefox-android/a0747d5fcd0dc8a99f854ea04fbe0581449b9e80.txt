[focus] Skip \n removal on html string export

This makes translation more difficult, and isn't necessary.

These \n are inserted when exporting strings.xml to the .pot file.
They're retained on translation, and also retained on reimport
to values-*/strings.xml. However Android/webview don't care about
\n in html content, it's completely ignored - so we don't need to care.
