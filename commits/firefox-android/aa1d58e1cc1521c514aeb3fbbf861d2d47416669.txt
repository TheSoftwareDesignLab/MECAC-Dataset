Bug 1864682 - Adding FxA AccountState.Authenticating

We now always transition to an AccountState after processing events.
I'm hoping to have progress states internal to the state machine,
the application will only react to AccountState changes.  That was
pretty much how it worked before, except for the BeginAuthentication
state.

This also simplifies some of the code, there's no more need for the
`OAuthObserver` interface or the `latestAuthState` variable.  The state
machine transitions to `Authenticating` and that state contains the data
we need to start the oauth flow.

Lastly this moves the state check into `State.next` which fits with the
application-services code migration plan, since that function is one of
the things I'm hoping to move over.
