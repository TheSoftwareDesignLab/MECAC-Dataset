[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/6526 - Dismiss CFR when anchor disappears

Prevents a lack of purpose for the CFR or a window overlay which would prevent
touches to the views below.
Also helps prevent a WindowManager leak if the app is removed from the task
manager while the CFR was showing.
