Bug 1855979 - Basic Translation Beginning

The goal of this bug is to get a very basic initial `translate`
interaction using the default determined page language and default
determined user language and begin starting `Controller` and `Interactor`
files.

This bug also sets up `sessionId` as a navigation parameter for
translations.
