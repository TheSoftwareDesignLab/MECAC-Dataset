[focus] Bug 1781051 - simplify setting ownerEmail in .taskcluster.yml

Remove special case for github-actions: the github-actions special case
breaks chain-of-trust's ability to rebuild the decision task definition:
because we don't leave a breadcrumb to record event.sender.login, it has
to guess, and if it gets it wrong, chain of trust verification fails.
