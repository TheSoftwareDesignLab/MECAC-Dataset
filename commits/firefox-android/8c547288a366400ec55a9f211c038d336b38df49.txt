[focus] Disable wideWiewPort (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/461)

This breaks error pages, and could potentially cause weird effects
on other pages. Chrome uses setLoadWithOverViewMode by default,
but doesn't use wideViewPort - we should probably do the same.
It also seems to disable zooming for such pages.
