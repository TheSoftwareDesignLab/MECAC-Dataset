[focus] Do search hint updating in onFilter() to cover autocomplete selection (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/320)

This seems to be what Fennec does too - onFilter() is called anytime
the "user selected" text changes - regardless of it being typed,
or the autocomplete selection being changed by tapping.
