[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/6409 - New CFR popup composable.

This is intended to fix all issues related to layout and anchoring and serve as
the default way for building and showing a CFR popup. (Anchored to top).

Because of the async nature of the values for insets and screen rotation
immediately after an orientation change the popup will automatically get
dismissed to prevent any anchoring issues.
While not ideal the effect of this is better than accepting layout issues after
orientation changes and is the same approach used for other of our popups.
