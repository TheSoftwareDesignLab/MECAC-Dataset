[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/8651 - Ensure FenixSnackbar has a proper root for inflating into

FenixSnackbar, as the platform Snackbar can only be inflated in either a
`CoordinatorLayout` or a `FrameLayout`.
Ensure our HistoryFragment's layout uses one of these as it's root.
