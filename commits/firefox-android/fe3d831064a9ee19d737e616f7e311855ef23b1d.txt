[focus] Implement blocklist preloading (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/76)

Previously, blocklists would be loaded on the UI thread (!), every time
the webview was shown. Instead, we should keep a static reference to the
lists and only load them once per session.

Loading the lists at app startup is helpful, since we should then have all
necessary data in memory by the time the user finishes typing a URL. Even
if we ever open directly to the webview, the UI will no longer be blocked.
(The loading/processing time for blocklists seems to be insignificant, but
 we should still do this for those times when reading from disk might be slow.)
