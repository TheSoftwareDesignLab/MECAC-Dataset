[focus] Create build pipeline on taskcluster for pushes to the master branch. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2032)

This patch introduces a new task pipeline on taskcluster:

Build -+--> Unit tests ----+- UI tests --> Preview release
        \-> Code quality -/

If a task in the pipeline fails subsequent tasks won't be executed.

The final "preview release" task will create signed beta APKs that
can be used for testing purposes.
