[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/21183: remove component init check from excessive resource test.

This check doesn't seem high value because initializing a component
only indicates a performance problem if it's slow, which is not most
components, so it's likely to result in many false positives. To fix
the intermittent, we won't lose much if we remove it.
