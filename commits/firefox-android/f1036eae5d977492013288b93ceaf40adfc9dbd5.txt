[focus] Make BrowserFragment LocaleAware (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/122)

We don't actually show any String in this fragment, so we don't need
to perform any changes (the menu is reinitalised every time its shown,
so the locale there is updated dynamically and independently of the
fragment).
