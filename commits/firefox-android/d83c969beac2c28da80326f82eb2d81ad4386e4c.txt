[focus] Animate URL bar when switching from home screen to url input and back. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/115)

In addition to adding the animation:
* We now do not use AddToBackStack() anymore. It had weird side effects of fragments
  suddenly existing multiple times. Instead some fragments now have onBackPressed()
  callbacks to handle pressing back themselves if they wish to. This fixes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/371.
* We now treat pressing back in the BrowserFragment as if the user pressed the erase
  button (only if there's no browser history to go back to anymore). With that the
  behavior is more consistent and we always remove the browser history when you go
  back to the home screen. This fixes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/373.
