[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/9922 - Calculate menu width only once, before layout

Previously the width could've change while the menu was scrolled or the width
may have been too small / big for the entire list when a larger / narrower
would be initially off screen, waiting for a scroll to be laid out.
