Bug 1847305 - Fix tests for NestedGeckoView

Fixed the current tests to pass.

The current tests are asserting implementation, so a new test was added
to test the behaviour by wrapping `NestedGeckoView` in a parent `View`
and counts the `onInterceptTouchEvent` calls it receives. When we are
in a gesture (starting with `ACTION_DOWN`) we deny the touch events to
the parent views until we receive a result from APZ.
