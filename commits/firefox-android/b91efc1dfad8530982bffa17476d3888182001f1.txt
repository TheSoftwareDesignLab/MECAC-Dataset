[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/11099: Introduce KeyManager structure

This adds an abstract KeyManager class to our storage component, which
establishes a pattern of managing keys as used by our storage classes
that require encryption.

AutofillCrypto and LoginsCrypto become implementors of this basis class,
allowing them to explicitly share structure and some core functionality.
