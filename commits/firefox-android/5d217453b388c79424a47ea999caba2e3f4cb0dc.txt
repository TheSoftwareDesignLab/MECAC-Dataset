* Address change requests

* Refactor away the initialize function

This adds the changes that were formerly part of https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/8996 since it was easier to implement them here

* Move observer to interface definition

* Move companion object functions to instance functions

* Lint - remove unnecessary blank line
