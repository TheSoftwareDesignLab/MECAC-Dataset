[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/10133 - BrowserMenuCompoundButton now reports the right dimensions

A BrowserMenuCompoundButton setup with compound drawables and used in our
BrowserMenu configured with a DynamicWidthRecyclerVIew will return a width
smaller with the size + padding of the compound drawables.

By replacing the default `inherit` layout direction for the initial onMeasure
we ensure the menu will also count the bounds of the compound drawables.
