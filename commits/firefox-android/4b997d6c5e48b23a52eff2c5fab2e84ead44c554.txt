[fenix] IntentReceiverActivity: Simplify intent handling.

This patch removes the need to process() and then match() on every intent processor.
A successful process() means that we already matched. Doing this in two steps caused
issues when the process() failed but later the simple check in match() returned true.

After this patch lands I intent to remove the match() API from the IntentProcessor
interface in AC:
