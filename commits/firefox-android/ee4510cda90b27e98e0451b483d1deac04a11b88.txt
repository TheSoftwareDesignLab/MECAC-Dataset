[focus] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1955: Add SupportUtils.SumoTopic; use for whats_new, autocomplete.

Two issues:
- Using Strings as arguments to getSumoURLForTopic is error-prone
- Having individual methods to fix ^ is time-consuming and creates boilerplate

Enums solve this issue.
