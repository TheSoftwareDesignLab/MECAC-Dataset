[fenix] Close https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/18845: Adds swipe-to-delete to tabs tray refactor

Copied the TabsTouchHelper from the `tabtray` package here so we don't
need to re-write our own because there's nothing more to add.

We can hook this up with our tabs tray here by putting it in the
`BaseBrowserTrayList` for our normal and private tabs list.
