[fenix] Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/4323: Modified UI of component_collection_creation.

To fix the overlapping issue I used Guideline and
layout_constraintWidth_default property. I also used the
layout_constraintHorizontal_bias property to make the back_button to
lean to the left and the select_all_button to lean to the right.
