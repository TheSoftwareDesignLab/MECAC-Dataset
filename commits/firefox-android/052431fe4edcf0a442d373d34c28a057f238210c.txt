[components] Add 'defaultSession' to SessionManager

Problem this is trying to solve:

SessionManager doesn't own its "empty" state (no selected session, no sessions at all).
Components which rely on the SessionManager may make assumptions about what happens
when SessionManager becomes "empty", and current approach is for some component to "take charge",
and be responsible for adding a "default" session when there are none left.

This doesn't bode well for composing components. We can get into a kind of "action at a distance"
situation, when various components make certain assumptions (say, SessionManager must always have
a selected session), but none of them actually take charge and populate the manager when appropriate.
Since components aren't necessarily aware of each other, and ideally are arbitrarily composable,
this graph of implicit dependencies becomes problematic.

This patch:
A naive solution to this is to get the SessionManager to owner its "empty" state.
This patch allows "default" behaviour to be specified at creation time, supplying a lambda
which produces a default session. Not supplying this lambda is equivalent to allowing SessionManager
to be empty.
