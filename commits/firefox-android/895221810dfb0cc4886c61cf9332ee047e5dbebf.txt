Bug 1815883 - Switch to the `rust_log_forwarder` module.

This replaces the `rustlog` module, but uses UniFFI to expose the
interface.

Updated Focus to not pass the crash reporter to `RustLog.enable()`.
This parameter has been ignored/deprecated for a while, but only the
Fenix code was updated to not pass it.
