[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5881 - Remove current app from share list

Create a custom intent chooser which should contains the apps list without
the current one
Separate approaches were created since for Android N and above we can use
Intent.EXTRA_EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS and for Android M and above an empty
chooser is displayed sometimes
