Bug 1857537 - [a11y] Add heading structure to Review Checker

Review Checker BETA couldn't be navigated to by using TalkBack headings
shortcuts because it wasn't recognized as an heading. And when it was
focused it wasn't announced as a heading.
The same problems were found at the other sections too.

As solution, the semantics properties are used.
AdjustedProductRatingCard was declared as heading only and it will not
be announced by TalkBack as "Heading" because it makes harder to
understand the information, but it can be navigated as a heading.
