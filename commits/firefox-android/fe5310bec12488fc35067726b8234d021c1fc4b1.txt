[fenix] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/20901: Do not record viewTime observations when we do not have a set lastAccess

The bug here was that we'd try to record `now - 0` as a viewTime delta.
This isn't just an obviously wrong value to record, but it will also
overflow our storage - we'll end up with a value on disk that doesn't
fit into an i32, but HistoryMetadata.total_view_time is i32 in our Rust
struct. Once that happens, reads that touch this bad row will result in
an overflow and a crash.
