[focus] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1936: Handle lifecycle changes for async task in add search engine screen.

I assert that onPause is the first required callback for lifecycle changes and
while I don't know that for sure, the fragment lifecycle seems to indicate that
is the case:

Furthermore, I checked all of the get*/is* state methods of the fragment inside
onPostExecute and none of them seemed to give indication that we could:
- Modify the views
- Call FragmentManager.popBackStack

Without further complex code handling (e.g. scheduling
fragmentManager.popBackStack to run when the application returns to the
foreground because it doesn't seem possible to run in the background).

Note that I came up with this solution myself quickly so it may have errors.
However, other solutions on the internet seemed unsafe or more complicated,
hence why I went for this one. The Google recommended method appears to be
Loaders, but which add a lot of complexity.
