Bug 1869225 - Catch `SuggestApiException`s.

This commit adds a `handleSuggestExceptions` helper to
`FxSuggestStorage` that catches and reports `SuggestApiException`s from
the Suggest Rust component. `handleSuggestExceptions` works like the
existing `handle{Fxa, Places}Exceptions` helpers.

`FxSuggestIngestionWorker`'s retry behavior is unchanged: if ingestion
fails, the exception will now be reported, but the operation will still
be rescheduled using `WorkManager`'s retry mechanism, as before.
