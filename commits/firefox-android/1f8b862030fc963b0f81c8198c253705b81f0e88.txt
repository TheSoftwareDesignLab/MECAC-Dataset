[focus] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4858: fix back button behaviour from Manage sites page

`navigateUp` currently sends back button presses (both system and app toolbar) from the `SearchAutocompleteList` (manage sites) page back to the Search settings page, skipping URL autocomplete settings.

This commit changes the `page` parameter in the call to `navigateUp` to `SearchAutocomplete`, causing the back button to go from the Manage sites page to URL autocomplete settings as expected.
