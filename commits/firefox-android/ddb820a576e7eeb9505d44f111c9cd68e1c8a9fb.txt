[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/1128: browser-engine-system: Automatically grant playing protected media (EME APIs).

This is a workaround for Firefox for Fire TV to play DRM content automatically.

Eventually we want to implement this API in a way that the app (or another component) can
handle those requests. See: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/1157
