[components] Introduce an `HistogramBase` interface in the GleanSDK

The context for this is bug 1566368: this is needed in order
for the glean parsers to generate an API to route batched
streaming telemetry calls to the Glean SDK.

This also changes the Glean error reporting mechanism to support
reporting multiple errors of the same type in one call.
