[focus] Taskcluster/Travis: Use dummy token for non release builds.

There's an "emergency brake" in our release buils: We will crash if
no Adjust token is set. This is to prevent that we release a version
without the token set. However in automation we are running unit tests
that might trigger this code path and therefore crash. To avoid this
we previously set the environment variable for the token to a random
value. We now have to write such a random value to the .adjust_token
file.
