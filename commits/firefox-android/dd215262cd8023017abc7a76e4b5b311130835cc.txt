[focus] Read Adjust token from local file instead of environment variable. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1488)

Getting the token from an environment variable is confusing. When using
multiple shells then builds can have different results depending on which
one is used. A locale file is straight-forward and has understandable
results. Going forward this will make getting and setting the token in
automation easier as well.
