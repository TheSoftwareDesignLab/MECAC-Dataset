[focus] Add list of release and screenshot locales. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1470)

This list is python code so that it can be consumed easily by other
scripts.

I'm planning to use this list to split our long running screenshot
task into multiple tasks that run in parallel. As I needed to
compile this list manually for the Folly release ("What locales
should be in the release?"), this was a good time to serialize
this into a file into the repository.

Going forward this list can be used to configure our release
builds to automatically only contain the release locales.
