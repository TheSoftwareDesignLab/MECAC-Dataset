[fenix] Remove direct A-S dependency; switch to using 'full' megazord

As far as I can tell, we never actually exercise the a-s libraries in Fenix tests currently (this was one of the presumed reasons for having a direct dependency).
In a different branch I've started work on adding end-to-end tests, but currently that's blocked on trying to figure out to load native libraries in tests (somehow, fenix's setup is different than what we have in A-C, not yet clear to me in what way).

Another reason for a direct dependency (i think) is that we needed it to configure a `fenix` megazord. This could be solved via a `support-megazord-fenix` a-c component that provides the correct transient dependencies,
but we can also just switch to use the `full` megazord instead, which is essentially what fenix megazord is at this point. A-S team wants to remove the fenix megazord, so this will help. This is what this patch does.
