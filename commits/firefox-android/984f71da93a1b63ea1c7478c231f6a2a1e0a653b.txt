[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/10555 - Use INPUT_HANDLING_UNKNOWN as the default of InputResultDetail

We need to wait until having a response from GeckoView on how it handled the
touch only after which we'll know whether to animate the toolbar or not.

The edgecase scenario of having pull to refresh enabled even before having a
response from GeckoView will still work because "canOverscrollTop()" only
checks for the touch to not be handled by the browser to pan the page.
