[fenix] No issue: Move PublicSuffixList to root component

With the PublicSuffixList class in Utilities, the first instantiation
of it (prefetching in onCreate), causes the Utilities to instantiate
and thus slowing down startup by needing the SearchEngineManager from
instantiating as well.

Moving this back to the root component fixes the immediate perf issue.
