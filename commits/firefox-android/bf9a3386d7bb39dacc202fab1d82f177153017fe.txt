[fenix] https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/4596 migrate collections (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/5911)

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/4596: move code from CollectionCreationComponent to CollectionCreationStore

Other than adding comments, no changes were made. The code will be updated in a following commit. This is in order to make the commit diff more readable.

* For 4596: update CollectionCreateStore to libstate

* For 4596: copied CollectionCreationUIView into CollectionCreationView

Otherwise, no code was changed. The next commit will update this code. This is in order to make the commit diff more readable.

* For 4596: update CollectionCreationView to LibState

Note that the minimal changes possible to enable migration were made.  Refactoring will happen in a later commit.

* For 4596: updated CollectionCreationTabListAdapter to work with the new View

* For 4596: updated SaveCollectionListAdapter to work with the new View

* For 4596: implemented CollectionCreationController

For now, it has an identical interface to the interactor. In a later commit several of its responsibilities will be moved around, some to the interactor and some to the reducer

* For 4596: copied over previous reducer code

No other changes were made. The code will be updated in the following commit. This is done to make changes more readable for the reviewer

* For 4596: update reducer code param names

Otherwise, no changes at this time

* For 4596: add arguments to CreateCollectionFragment in nav_graph

These will be used to replace the current CreateCollectionViewModel, which shares data between fragments in a way that doesn't fit within our architecture.

* For 4596: pass arguments to collection via transaction instead of VM

The VM will be removed in a later commit

* For 4596: update BrowserToolbarController to share state to collection via its Direction

* For 4596: removed CreateCollectionViewModel

* For 4596: test tab retrieval in CreateCollectionFragment

* For 4596: fix crashing CreateCollectionFragmentTest

* For 4596: removed classes create collection classes used by old architecture

* For 4596: collection interactor rename + kdoc

* For 4596: moved collection interactor interface

* For 4596: renamed CreateCollectionFragment

All related classes followed the pattern of CollectionCreationX

* For 4596: kdoc CollectionCreationController

There's no effective difference between these calls and their interactor equivalent, so I linked to them

* For 4596: fix bug that caused rename to not work

* For 4596: removed unused collection actions

These were unused before the LibState refactor

* For 4596: kdoc StepChanged

* For 4596: removed todos about moving logic to the reducer

saveTabsToCollection: this could be moved, but that would involve creating a new action. SaveCollectionStep should probably be refactored out, so adding this layer of indirection seemed counterproductive

handleBackPress: needs to be able to call dismiss(). The reducer doesn't (and shouldn't) be able to do that, so this needs to live here

stepBack: called by handleBackPress. See above

* For 4596: wrote tests for CollectionCreationController#stepback

* For 4596: fixed tests broken by changes to collections

* For 4596: small readability refactor for CollectionController#stepBack

No change to functionality (see tests)

* For 4596: broke apart CollectionView#update

There's probably a lot more that could be done here, but smaller changes were made to reduce scope

* For 4596: remove unnecessary todos

It looks like we don't follow the suggested pattern in this project

* For 4596: test CollectionCreationController#normalSessionSize

* For 4596: updated naming in CollectionCreationController per review
