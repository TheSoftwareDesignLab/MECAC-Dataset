[components] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/7002: Extract icon decoder into a generic image decoder in support-images.

Extracts `AndroidIconDecoder`, `IconDecoder` and `DesiredSize` out of `browser-icons`
into a new component `support-images`, which provides helpers for handling images. `AndroidIconDecoder` and `IconDecoder`
are renamed to `AndroidImageDecoder` and `ImageDecoder` in `support-images`.
