[focus] Avoid jarring white screen in InfoActivity

WebView initialisation and loading is noticeable. It initially shows
a whitescreen, until the point where content is loaded. We can make
this smoother by hiding the content (and showing a dark background) until
content has finished loading.

(I don't really understand why loading is so slow, even "Your Rights",
which isn't generated dynamically, is slow.)
