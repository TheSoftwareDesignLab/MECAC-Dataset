[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/2893, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/2673, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/2916, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/2314: Fix race condition navigating to browser (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/3023)

Since the Navigation library restores the fragment after memory eviction, if we're already on the BrowserFragment and we deep link navigate to the BrowserFragment, we briefly get two of them. This crashes GeckoView.
