[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/15756 - Add a play/pause button in the tabs tray grid layout

Moved the previous layout in a new, bigger FrameLayout that would serve as a
buffer space for the play/pause button to be translated to the exterior.
Otherwise the button would be clipped.
