[focus] Stop BrowsingSession when calling Activity.finish() (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/450)

If we don't do this: the FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCHED_FROM_HISTORY handling
code in MainActivity fails because we never stopped the BrowsingSession
despite exiting. Which leads to us keeping the CustomTabConfig
even when trying to load pages in normal mode.
