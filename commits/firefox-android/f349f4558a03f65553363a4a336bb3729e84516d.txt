[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5254 - Update keepHidden default value

Erase button state is not persisted between tabs and it is restored at every switch.
keepHidden default value was false which makes the button to pops up even when the
number of tabs was bigger than 1
By updating keepHidden default value to true we avoid those scenarios when the visibility
of button is set to VISIBLE and imediately after that is set to GONE
