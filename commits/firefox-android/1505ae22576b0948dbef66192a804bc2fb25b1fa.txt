[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5487 - Update floating button auto hide state in real time

By setting auto hide state to false we are able to control manually the visibility
of a floating button, in this manner we avoid those scenarios when we are trying to
show the button but the default behavior class hides it
"enable" variable was removed because put the button in an inconsistent state,
not visible but enabled
