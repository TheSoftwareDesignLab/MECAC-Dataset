[fenix] Close https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/18774: Migrate mutli-selection to store

Removes the recyclerview-selection library and replaces it with the
SelectionHolder/SelectionInteractor with a Store.

This is an implementation that's similar to what we have in other UI
lists (library).
