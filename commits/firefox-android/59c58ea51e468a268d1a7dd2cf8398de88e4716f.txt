[focus] Add comments to raw Intent usage where no SafeIntent is needed (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/569)

Note: we also touch raw intents in places like InfoActivitiy. Those
intents are safe because we create them ourselves. It would  be nice
to have some static analysis and/or lint check for getIntent() calls,
if those are added then we'll probably need to either wrap
these locations (where I've added comments), or add an annotation,
or modify the rest of our code to use SafeIntent - all depending
on the exact approach taken. See also:
