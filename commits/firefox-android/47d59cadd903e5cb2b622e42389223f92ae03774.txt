[focus] Fix back-button navigation with browser on backstack (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/113)

With BrowserFragment being on the backstack, back button presses result
in the backstack being popped by default. Instead we check whether the
webview wants to consume the back button press, and we only go to default
handling (which results in the backstack being popped) if not.
