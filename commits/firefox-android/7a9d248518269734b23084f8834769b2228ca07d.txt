[focus] Move About page into FocusWebViewClient (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/199)

This is needed because of the new InfoActivity implementation
that uses WebViewProvider. Our about page loading implementation
is WebView specific, so it has to be somewhere within the webkit code.
This also means the about page is accesible in-browser, that doesn't
seem hugely significant.
