[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5261 - Avoid FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK for the custom tab intent

Debugging the normal behavior shows that custom tabs launched from other apps
will have no flags set for the Intent while the previous
ActivityTestRule#launchActivity will set FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag on the
intent which after the recent changes will break the custom tabs functionality.

Replacing the now deprecated ActivityTestRule with ActivityScenario for
starting a new custom tabs intent will have no flags set on the intent and so
ensure the intended behavior without having to hardcode removing the NEW_TASK
flag in app code.
