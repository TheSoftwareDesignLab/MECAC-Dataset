[focus] Add script for scheduling taskcluster tasks for taking screenshots. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1470)

This script will later run inside a task that is triggered by a hook[1].
Once the task runs it will spawn several child tasks that take screenshots
for a subset of locales.
