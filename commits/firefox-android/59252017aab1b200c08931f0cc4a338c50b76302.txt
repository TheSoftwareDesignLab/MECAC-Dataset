[components] Part 6: Move error handling into FirefoxAccount and DeviceConstellation

This patch makes FirefoxAccount safe-to-use directly, without forcing
consumers to worry about exception handling.

Auth exceptions are posted to the authErrorRegistry. Panics and non-Fxa
exceptions are re-thrown.

This change required OAuthAccount interface changes.

Similarly, FirefoxDeviceConstellation is now safe-to-use directly as well.
