[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/644: Clear Data (WebView only)

This only includes the implementation for the SystemWebView that's based
off of what we currently do in Focus/Fire TV. Since this is needed for
those apps now, we can work with this implementation until GeckoView
provides us with a nicer API to do the equivalent for it. (Bug 1489669)

We also don't notify any observers since there isn't any
confirmation/information available that we can propagate to cients.
