[focus] lint: Performance issues in preference layout (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/108)

Two minor changes:
- lint recommends disabling baseline alignment (it shouldn't have any
  effect for preferences anyway)
- 0dp width when using layout_weight, since wrap_content force calculating
  a width that won't actually be used.
