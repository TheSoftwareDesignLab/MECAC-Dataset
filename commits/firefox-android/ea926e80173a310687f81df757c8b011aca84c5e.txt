[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11404 - Create open all function

- Create element to be displayed

- Update the interface and bind in the view holder
Set the filter to limit this action to FOLDER.

- Create core function
Main logic is done on the controller (has it should be done). The whole
process is done in one coroutine to be non-blocking as many
(sub)folders & links can be present. If folder is empty, a toast is
displayed. Else iterate on items. When item is:
- a FOLDER -> restart process (without toast) on the folder
- a ITEM -> open it
- a SEPARATOR -> do nothing
Once finished, show the tabs tray.

Toast message is defined in fragment to have access to context.

- Create androidTest for openAllInTabs
- Create tests for handleBookmarkFolderOpening
- Display 'open all' options only if folder has at least on child:
A coroutine and suspended functions have to be used, since `getTree`
is async.
