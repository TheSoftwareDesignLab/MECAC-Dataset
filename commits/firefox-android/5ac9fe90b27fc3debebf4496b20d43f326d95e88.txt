[fenix] Bug 1812580 - Wait for the layout cycle to complete before changing anchors

This comes to solve the issue seen in the error logs by adding the anchor
change done for the snackbar to the operation queue on thread Main thread.
Should allow to avoid chaning the snackbar's anchor in between onMeasure and
onLayout.
