[components] Support for tracking external sources

Mainly, does two things:
- refactors SessionState.Source into a richer form (splitting sources
  into Internal and External, where External ones track information
  about originating package)
- adds persistence of External sources into tab session state; we don't
  want to persist Internal sources as that was explicitly removed before
  for causing various issues (e.g. UI behaving incorrectly after
  restoring tabs with various internal sources set)
