[focus] Followup: only reuse existing fragment if visible (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/319)

It's possible for browserFragment to exist, without being useful:
if you exit BrowserFragment by erase()'ing, we replace() it with
HomeFragment. FragmentMangaer doesn't kill BrowserFragment then,
but trying to load a URL at that point does nothing. In this case,
we should use the normal framgent replacement logic to ensure we can
still load URLs after erase().

(The other case is when you exit BrowserFragment by pressing the back
 button, in that case BrowserFragment is popped off the backstack,
 and FragmentManager completely kills it.)
