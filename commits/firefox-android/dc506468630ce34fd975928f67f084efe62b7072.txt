[fenix] 16900 make navgraph inflation asynchronous (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/18889)

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: implement async navgraph inflation

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: removed nav graph from xml

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: inflate navGraph programatically

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Made NavGraph inflation asynchronous

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Changed to block with runBlocking

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Refactored blocking call into a function

For 16900: NavGraph inflation is now async

We now attach the nav graph (or check if its attached) on every nav call ( an extension function for NavController).
This is done by checking the value of the job stored in PerfNavController.map which keeps track of the job with the NavController as a Key.
If the job hasn't been completed, it will block the main thread until the job is done. The job itself is responsible for attaching the navgraph
to the navcontroller (and the inflation of the latter too)

For 16900: rebased upstream master

For 16900: Rebase on master

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Fixed Async Navgraph navigation per review comments.

1)The Asynchronous method is now found in NavGraphProvider.kt. It creates a job on the IO dispatcher
2)The Job is tracked through a WeakHashMap from Controller --> NavGraph
3)The Coroutine scope doesn't use MainScope() anymore
4)The Coroutine is cancelled if the Activity is destroyed
5)The tests mockk the blockForNavGraphInflation method through the FenixReoboelectricTestApplication instead of calling the mock every setup()

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: inflateNavGraphAsync now takes navController

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Pass lifecycleScope to NavGraphProvider

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: removed unused mock

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Added linter rules for navigate calls

We need linting rules to make sure no one calls the NavController.navigate() methods

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Added TestRule to help abstract the mocks in the code

For 16900: Fix linting problems

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Cleaned duplicated code in tests

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: cleaned up NavGraphTestRule for finished test

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: had to revert an accidentally edited file

For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: rebased master

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16900: Review nits for async navgraph
