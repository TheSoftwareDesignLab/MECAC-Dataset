[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5366 - Remove ResizableLayout from the main page

Sometimes the space between keyboard and toolbar is not enough to display properly all the views,
even if are resized by ResizableLayout
After this commit all views from home screen aren't resized anymore when the keyboard is open
