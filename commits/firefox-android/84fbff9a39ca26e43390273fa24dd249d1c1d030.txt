[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/9770 - Don't animate the dynamic toolbar while tab is loading

Toolbar will not be animated while the tab is loading irrespective of the
intrinsic checks made in the BrowserToolbarBehavior - whether the touch is a
vertical scroll and it was handled by GeckoView.
