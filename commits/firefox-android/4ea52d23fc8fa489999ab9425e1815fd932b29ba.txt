[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/9904 - Add ExpandableLayout as a menu wrapper used by PopupWindow

This new layout is specifically designed for one particular purpose:
wrapping a bottom placed menu to allow it to:
- first being displayed as collapsed until a specific menu item index
- inform about touches in the empty space left by the collapsed view
- automatically expand when users swipes up it will expand.
Once expanded it will remain so.

This was the only viable solution for allowing bottom anchored PopupWindows
to be expanded and collapsed.
