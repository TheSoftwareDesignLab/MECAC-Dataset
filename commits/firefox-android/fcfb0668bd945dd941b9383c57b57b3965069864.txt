[focus] Print output of import-strings.sh even if the script fails. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1832)

The tee command copies standard input to standard output and also to
any files given as arguments.

With that we can print the output and save it to a file - even if
the command fails. However now the whole script would not fail
because "tee" exists without an error. That's why we check
"${PIPESTATUS[0]}" to fail in case import-strings.sh failed.
