[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/9798: Disable buttons on hiding and enable on showing.

This is triggered on collection expanding or shrinking that is animated.
The animation has android:fillEnabled="true" android:fillAfter="true".
This interferes with set visibility to gone and the click still triggers.
Disabling button avoids changing animation or force clearing it.
