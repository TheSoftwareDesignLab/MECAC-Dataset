[focus] Stop triggering multiple nightlies off the same revision

Similar to https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/25634, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/12294,
and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1380123 before that, we don't
want/need to push a new build to the play store if there haven't been any code
changes.
