[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/9774 - Removes beforeTextChangedIndex, cause for backspace issues

Initially added to fix https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/6276 it seems beforeTextChangedIndex is no longer necessary and moreover it causes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/12525 when using keyboards with autocorrect enabled, as it counts the index start for the last group of letters that form an autocorrect "text", such as a path from url (i.e. "android-components" from https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components would make beforeTextChangedIndex == 33).
