Bug 1833452 - Fix app services autopublish when building Fenix/Focus

Moved the code into `settings.gradle` and put it inside an `allprojects`
block.  I'm not 100% sure what's going on but I think this applies the
changes to android-components projects as well.  In any case, `./gradlew
assembleDebug` now seems to pick up the local app-services code.
