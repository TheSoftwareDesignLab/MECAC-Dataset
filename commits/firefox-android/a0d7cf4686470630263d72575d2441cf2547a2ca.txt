[focus] pmd: add basic config (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/573)

This enables pmd by default, but doesn't fail builds when issues are
found. The current config produces 123 errors, it's possible add further
options (which we can possibly do in future).

The current config is from the pmd docs at:
