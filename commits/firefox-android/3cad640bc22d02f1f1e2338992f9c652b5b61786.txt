Bug 1860844 - Add GeckoTranslateSessionDelegate to Android Components

This bug adds a translation session delegate for receiving information
from GeckoView on the state of the toolkit translation engine and also
when to expect and offer translations on a given page.

It also updates reference browser to use auto-detected defaults for
translating.
