[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/pull/11175 - Migrate runBlocking and runBlockingTest to runTest in ui tests

`runBlockingTest` is deprecated and cannot be used in ui tests either.
Took this opportunity to also refactor some `runBlocking` usages also to
`runTest` as the recommended api to run tests inside a coroutine.
