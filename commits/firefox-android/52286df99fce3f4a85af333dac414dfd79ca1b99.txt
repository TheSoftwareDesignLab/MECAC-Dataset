Bug 1838580 - [a11y] Increase tap area for search engine icon

The touching area for search engine icon (Google by default) from
the search bar was only 28dp.
To Increase tap area to reach the minimum accessibility touch target
size of 48dp, it was used TouchDelegate. This way there are no visual
changes.
