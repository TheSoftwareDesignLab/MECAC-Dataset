[focus] Wrap preference titles (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/236)

For some reason setting android:preferenceStyle, even with an empty
style, results in text sizing breaking - even though Preference
doesn't seem to even care about text styling (it only uses that for
things like layouts and pref contents, not styling). This is a complete
mess to debug, so I decided to just set the pref layout directly
instead.

Even just using the default preference style results in this happening,
e.g.:
<item name="android:preferenceStyle">?android:preferenceStyle</item>
results in the text looking huge, and switches disappearing.
