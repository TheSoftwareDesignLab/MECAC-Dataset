[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/7001 - Set tracking cfr to false on dismiss
Before this commit the state of tracking protection cfr was set to false
as soon as the cfr was shown, fact which can lead to a bug.
An event is received to show the cfr but the cfr is already displayed and
the app crashes
To solve this I set tracking cfr to false on dismiss, when the preference is
also set to false
