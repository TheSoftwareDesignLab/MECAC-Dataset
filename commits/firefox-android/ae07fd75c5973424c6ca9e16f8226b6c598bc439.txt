[components] Improvements around FirefoxSyncFeature state management and ergonomics

This patch includes a few changes:
- it changes 'sync' to be a 'suspend' function, dropping requirement for a CoroutineContext.
  We are starting to understand what we care about vis-a-vis scopes, so let's make this
  more flexible so that realistic usage patterns may emerge at the consumer level (reference browser).
- it introduces a mutex, which guards sync operation exposed by this feauture.
  We don't want multiple sync operations to be running at once, so the feature shouldn't
  expose that footgun to its users.
- doesn't throw AuthException, instead wrapping it in SyncError. This makes dealing with outcomes
  of sync a bit simpler.
  We still have work to do around unifying errors coming out of PlacesConnection, as some
  of those could be auth-related.
- introduces a SyncStateObserver interface and makes the feature an ObserverRegistry. This allows
  for much simpler UI code which needs to reflect sync's internal state.

Sample apps that use the feature are updated accordingly.
