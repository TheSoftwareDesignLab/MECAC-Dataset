[focus] Update to Android Components 63.0.0 and GeckoView 82

 - The `service-telemetry` component is now removed so we pin the
 version to the last released version. I opted for pinning instead of
 removing the component until we know what we want to remove/replace it
 with in the future. We have already disabled the GV integration as well
 and pinning just makes the diff smaller.
 - Added the GeckoSession to the `SessionExtensions` hashmap now that
 GeckoSession is no longer Parcelable and Focus relies on holding the
 in-memory instance of the session when using the 'open-in' feature.
