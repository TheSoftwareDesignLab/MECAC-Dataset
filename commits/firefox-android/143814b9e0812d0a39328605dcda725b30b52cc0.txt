[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/8545: Fix unnecessary scroll in home screen

Changed the height of the recycler view inside the home fragment
to ‘wrap_content’ to avoid scrolling if the viewport is not filled
with elements.

Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/8545
