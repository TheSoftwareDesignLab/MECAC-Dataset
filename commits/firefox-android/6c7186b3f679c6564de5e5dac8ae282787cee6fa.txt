[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/13300 - Adjust the 'Sharing a Collection' layout to prevent overlapping of the close icon and 'Share' label in RTL

Note that the "Share" title is still constrained to start at the end of the
close button - I don't know why the previous extra constraint was causing the
differing behavior in LTR and RTL, but this seems to fix it.
