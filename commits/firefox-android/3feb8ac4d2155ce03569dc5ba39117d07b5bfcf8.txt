[fenix] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/20663: Make inactive card collapsible

We use make the inactive tabs section of the tabstray collapsible in
this change, with a technical quirk: we want to make the "isExpanded"
state of the tabs stay for the lifetime of the app and not the tabs
tray, but this functionality does not exist.

In this patch, we're storing the UI state in a singleton class that
exists for the lifetime of the app, but a more concrete solution is to
use an AppStore that holds content like this, which we can land in a
future patch.
