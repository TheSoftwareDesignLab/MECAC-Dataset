[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/7964 - Don't set initial orientation in MediaFullscreenOrientationFeature

The Store that MediaFullscreenOrientationFeature is initialized with can either
have a null activeFullscreenOrientation if media wasn't playing before or,
because we use a global Store shared by all application's components it could
have an activeFullscreenOrientation already set by another component.

We'll ignore setting the initial orientation (which may be stall) for the new
component using MediaFullscreenOrientationFeature and only act upon subsequent
media orientation changes.
