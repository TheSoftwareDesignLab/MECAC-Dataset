[fenix] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/7720:
- Increased atp switch size to be consistent with `dimen/tracking_protection_item_height`(48dp).
- Cut out redundant traversal of TextViews in SwitchWithTraversal as per https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/shared-docs/blob/master/android/accessibility_guide.md
- Reuse `QuickSettingsText.Icon` style on the switch component to be consistent with other items in the component_tracking_protection_panel.xml
- Added new string resources for textOff and textOn state to get appropriate screen reader description (unsure of the translation/localisation process here!)
