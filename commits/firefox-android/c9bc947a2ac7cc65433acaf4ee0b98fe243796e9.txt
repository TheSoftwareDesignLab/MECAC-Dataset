Bug 1844523 - Translate and Restore to Original Engine Support

This patch adds engine support for translate and restoring the page after
a translation. `requestTranslate` and `requestTranslationRestore` are
the Gecko engine session functions.

This corresponding actions for these functions are `TranslateAction`,
and `TranslateRestoreAction`. The success and failure correspond to the
actions `TranslateSuccessAction` and `TranslateExceptionAction`.

Sample usage is provided on reference browser. The sample is currently
hardcoded to support Spanish to English page translations until the next
API is introduced.
