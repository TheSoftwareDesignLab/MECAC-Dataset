[focus] Split ScreenGrabTest into multiple tests. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1470)

This has two advantages:
* If one of the test fails then the others can still run and we can get
  screenshots for them. Currently if ScreenGrabTest fails then all
  following screenshots are missing.
* Independent tests are more stable and easier to tweak.
