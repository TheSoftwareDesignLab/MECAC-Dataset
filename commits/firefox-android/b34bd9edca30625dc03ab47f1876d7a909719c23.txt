[fenix] Fix for https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/8426 - Migration steps displayed in a different order than UI specifications

Changed the order of the whitelisted migrations in order to respect the UI specifications.

Now using linked hash map instead of hash map for the whitelisted migrations so we can preserve the
order of the steps upon status changing in the migration process.
