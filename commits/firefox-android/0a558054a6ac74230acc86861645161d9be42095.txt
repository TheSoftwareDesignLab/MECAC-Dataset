[fenix] Let relbot update A-C on trunk (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/26553)

* Let relbot update A-C on trunk

We already use relbot for this on fenix release branches and on all
branches for focus-android, so might as well avoid the duplication.

* Update mergify rules to auto-merge AC bumps from relbot on the main branch
