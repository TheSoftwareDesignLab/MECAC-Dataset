[focus] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1492: Don't delete cache files on disk; update test.

After we manually delete the cache files, WebView will no longer use the disk
cache, which means Focus uses much more network data. Therefore, we no longer
delete the cache.

While erase all the contents of cache/ except the WebView directory to be safe
that files that we don't want to stick around, won't. That being said,
different versions of WebView could store their files in different places and
this change won't help those users - we'll cross that bridge when we come to
it.

I tested the updated test on an Android API 23 & 26 emulator.
