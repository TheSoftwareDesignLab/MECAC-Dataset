[focus] Set FLAG_SECURE (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/103)

We want to enable this by default for everyone, however this flag
needs to be disabled for screenshot testing, hence we've added
a hidden preference. (This preference could be used to make things
configurable if needed in future, however we don't listen to pref
changes at this time, so that would need to be added if a user visible
preference is added.)
