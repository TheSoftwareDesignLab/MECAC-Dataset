[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/18672 - Renaming a TopSite changes just the title

Previously renaming a TopSite would bind that as a new item and in such update
the entire list. This could potentially leading changes in the list and then
it's ViewPager parent's layout.

This patch switches the code to use the existing TopSitePayload and so do a
partial update of an on-screen TopSite instead of rebind it as a new item.

If a layout is requested while showing <=4 TopSites on the second page, by
having "offscreenPageLimit = 1" the biggest height of ViewPager pages is used
preventing an edgecase where the ViewPager would hide half of the items from
the first page.
