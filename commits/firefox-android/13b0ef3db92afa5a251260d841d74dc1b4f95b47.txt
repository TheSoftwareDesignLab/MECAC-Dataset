[components] Implement a Gecko runtime telemetry delegate using Glean

The implemented delegate redirects all streaming telemetry
calls to the Glean SDK metrics defined in the `metrics.yaml`
file extracted from the GeckoView AAR the engine-gecko-*
component depends on.

This additionally bumps the version of the GeckoView dependency
for nightly.
