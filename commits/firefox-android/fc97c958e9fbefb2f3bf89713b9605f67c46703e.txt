[focus] Attach SearchSuggestionsViewModel to UrlInputFragment instead of Activity.

Attaching the view model to the activity, to fix the communication between UrlInputFragment and
SearchSuggestionsFragment, was a mistake. Too much state survives and causes bugs. We tried to
fix some of them, but the better fix is to just bind the view model to UrlInputFragment again.
And to fix the communication problem we let SearchSuggestionsFragment get it from its parent
fragment (UrlInputFragment).
