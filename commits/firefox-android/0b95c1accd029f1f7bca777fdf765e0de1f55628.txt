[focus] Add setting for changing search engine. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/25)

This is not functional yet. However with that patch we are landing the UI and strings already.
After importing the actual search engines (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/184) we will know what values we actually want to
store in the preference.
