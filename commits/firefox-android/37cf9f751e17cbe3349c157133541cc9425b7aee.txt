[components] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/287: SessionManager: Add functionality for removing sessions, finding session and observing changes.

* This change removes ObservableList. This abstraction was only used by SessionManager and made things more
  complicated than easier.

* It's now possible to instantiate a SessionManager without any sessions. This is required for some of our
  apps that want to show specific UI elements when no session exists.

* Add an empty default implementation (Unit) to all Observer methods so that it is not required to override
  all of them.
