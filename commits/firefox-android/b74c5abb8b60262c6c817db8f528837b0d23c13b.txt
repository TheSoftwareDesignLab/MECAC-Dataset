[fenix] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/19175: Fix SyncTabs list not updating on changes

The main cause for this is that the `LifecycleProvider` needs to be set
to `State.RESUMED` to avoid the account manager's internal
`ObserverRegistry` from putting the UI observers into the paused state.

The rest of the changes is to rely the internal (safe) logic to
correctly sync and then update the tabs list.
