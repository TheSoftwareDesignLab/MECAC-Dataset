[focus] Disable findbugs in buddybuild for now

Running gradle breaks the build, but only in buddybuild with the
sdk integration enabled. It seems buddybuild injects its SDK calls
into FocusApplication.java, however gradle doesn't actually know
about that dependency during postbuild. I have no idea how the main
build accesses it, this will need more investigation before reenabling.
