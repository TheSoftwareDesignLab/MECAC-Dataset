[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4617 - Hide floating buttons when the keyboard is shown

This functionality was already implemented but for a single view and because
we are having two floating buttons(erase and sessions counter) I sent through
the delegate view attribute an array of ids.
