[focus] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4876: fix settings menu background colours

The background colours in the settings menu seem to have been wiped when moving from Activity to Fragment. Re-added photonInk80 and photonInk90 as FrameLayout and Toolbar BGs respectively.
