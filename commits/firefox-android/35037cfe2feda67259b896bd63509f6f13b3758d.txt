[components] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/1109: concept-awesomebar: Introduce weights, suspend onInputChanged() and add shouldClearSuggestions.

* This change introduces the concept of "weights". Weights are used to rank suggestions against each other.
  This allows the awesomebar to mix suggestions from different providers.
* AwesomeBar.SuggestionProvider.onInputChanged() is now a suspending function.
* A provider can define `shouldClearSuggestions` to avoid suggestions getting cleared immediatelly once
  the entered text changes.
