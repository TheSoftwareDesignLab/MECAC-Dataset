[focus] Disable backup (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/368)

We want to make sure we don't accidentally persist any browsing data.
The only settings focus keeps are content blocking settings
(which are simple to configure), in addition to telemetry data (which
we also wouldn't need to persist).
