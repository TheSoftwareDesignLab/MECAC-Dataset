[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16424 - Focus the right item in tabs tray when using Talkback (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/16472)

To get the index of the current selected browser tab when using reverse layout
we should also account for items placed below of the browser tabs.
The patch here unifies the logic already used for some calls but not all.
