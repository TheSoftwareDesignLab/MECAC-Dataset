[focus] Switch to MainActivity when opening a custom tab in Focus. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2342, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2340, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2336, https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2335)

Previously we just turned the session into a non-custom-tab and re-created the
fragment. Now that custom tabs and the browser are separated we need to
explicitly switch to the browser task.
