Bug 1853113 - Monitor Search Widget presence based on activation

Previously, the way we registered if the user has installed the
search widget was keeping a count that increments every time
the widget was added and decrements everytime it was removed. The
main problem here was the wrong usage of onEnabled and onDeleted.
This patch aims to move towards a boolean based preference and use
the provided onDisabled method together with onEnabled. The logic
here is as follows: When the first instance of the widget has been
added, onEnabled will be called and the preference set to true and
no matter how many widgets are present on the homescreen, it will
stay true. When the last widget is removed, onDisabled will
be called and the pref will be set to false.
