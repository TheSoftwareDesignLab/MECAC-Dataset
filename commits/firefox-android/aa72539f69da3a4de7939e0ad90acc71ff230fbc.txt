[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/11374 - Handle focus changes in our own private listener

Previously we'd allow a listener being passed in and we'd hope it will
correctly handle restoring immersive mode.
Now we are handling focus changes and restoring immersive mode on ourselves
also allowing for a simpler public API.
