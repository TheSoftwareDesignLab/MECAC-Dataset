[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/22710 - Disable run-ui in build-contributor-pr workflow (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/22720)

* Disable run-ui in build-contributor-pr workflow

Unfortunately the problem with INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE is still showcasing itself on v2.21.0 – I'm not aware of any workaround at this moment in time, so I'm disabling this step of the workflow again.

* Update build-contributor-pr.yml
