[fenix] Remove selection holder from bookmark viewholder constructors.

Now that we're passing the mode to the viewholders in their bind
methods, there's no real need to pass them into their constructors. This
also allows us to remove the indirection of having the adapter implement
the SelectionHolder interface and have the mode implement it directly.
