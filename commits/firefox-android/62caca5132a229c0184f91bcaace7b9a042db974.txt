[fenix] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16435: Finish ExternalAppBrowserActivity and remove task if linked tab doesn't exist anymore.

This doesn't fix the underlying issue of https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16435, but a symptom we have seen quite often in different
situations: When the ExternalAppBrowserActivity is not linked to a tab anymore then it falls back
to displaying a (partially broken) browser UI. With multiple browser activities at the same time
sooner or later we crash with a "display already acquired" error because both activities try to
render the same tab.
