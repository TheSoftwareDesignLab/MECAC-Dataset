[focus] android2po: Retain CDATA sections without additional escaping

This is hacky and tricky, but python and lxml like to pretend
CDATA doesn't exist. This solution retains CDATA in the po files,
which should make translations simpler.

(Note: string import does the same thing: at that point we no longer
 care, Android correctly handles the escaped html at that stage and
 displays it as expected even when retrieved via Resources.getString().)
