[focus] Use bundled roboto fonts (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/218)

It's hard to tell that this is working: the easiest way to verify
is the "Your rights" html content title in "Your rights". Its weight
increases when we use sans-serif-medium vs. no setting (and webview
seems to default to roboto regardless, so the remaining text doesn't
change).
