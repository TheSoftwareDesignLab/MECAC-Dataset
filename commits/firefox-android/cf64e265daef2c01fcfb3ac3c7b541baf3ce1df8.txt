[fenix] Fix how we reflect FxA state in preference

This cleans up how we're displaying account state in the main preference UI.
Before when it worked, it worked mostly accidentally.
'launch' wrapper around "update ui" methods would trigger a race condition
between binding the account pref view holder and actually updating that view
with values. Sometimes the "update view with values" would happen after view
was bound, and the UI will be correct. Most of the time it would happen before,
and so there will be nothing to update and we'd get into an inconsistent state.

This also splits up the "accountpreference" into two: account is good,
and account needs re-auth. This greatly simplifies their management.
