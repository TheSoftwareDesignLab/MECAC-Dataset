[focus] Generate localeList in doLast to not be clobbered by clean (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/672)

The content of a task (configuration) is evaluated immediately, whereas
the actual task code needs to be put in doLast/doFirst. Previously,
the localeList would only be generated when configuring the localeList
task, clean would then always delete LocaleList.java, and actually running
generateLocaleList did... nothing. Now we generate the LocaleList.java
when actually running the task.
