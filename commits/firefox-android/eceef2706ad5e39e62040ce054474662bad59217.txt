[focus] lint: RtlSymmetry (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/108)

I don't understand why lint complains about this, but apparently
you have to explicitly set even 0dp padding. (We specifically only
want padding at the start of the toolbar, the other end has a menu button
with built in padding.)
