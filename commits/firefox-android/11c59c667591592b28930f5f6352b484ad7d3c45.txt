[fenix] Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/1186: Made quick actions sheet's handle larger.

It now takes up the entire horizontal space and all the vertical space
until the buttons. This gives a bigger touch target both for typical
users and TalkBack users when they use explore-by-touch.

Also changed content description. The content description should not
include semantic names like "handle". The screen reader already knows
it's a button and describes it as such. Same thing with "sheet".
