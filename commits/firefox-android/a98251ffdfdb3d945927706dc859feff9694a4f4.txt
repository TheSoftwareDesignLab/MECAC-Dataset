Bug 1860919 - Send Glean pings for Wikipedia Firefox Suggestion impressions and clicks.

This commit:

* Adds new facts, `wikipedia_suggestion_clicked` and
  `wikipedia_suggestion_impressed`, to the `feature-fxsuggest`
  component.
* Emits `fx-suggest` Glean pings for those facts in Fenix's
  `MetricController`.
