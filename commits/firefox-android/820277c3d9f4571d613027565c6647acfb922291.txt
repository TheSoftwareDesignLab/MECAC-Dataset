[focus] findbugs: no default: handle default, and return appropriate values (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/450)

onMenuItemClick() should return true when an item has been handled.
It seems cleanest to return true instead of breaking for handled items,
and we can then return false in the actually unhandled case cleanly.
