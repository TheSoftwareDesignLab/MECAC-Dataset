[focus] Add UrlMatcher disconnect list integration test (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/431)

This verifies that we've actually loaded disconnect lists correctly.

Note: this test will fail in focusWebkitRelease when running tests locally
(e.g. via |gradlew test|), due to the lack of the Adjust API token. That is
expected, BuddyBuild seems to always supply the API token hence that failure
doesn't occur on Buddybuild. It seems best to just ignore the local failure
in order to avoid making our adjust initialisation code have context-specific
workarounds (which could then fail, etc.).
