The only change made was updating "Focus/Klar" to "Fenix"

* For 3088: call translation pruning scripts during release builds

* For 3088: fix filter-release-translations.py

Moving it into Fenix introduced one additional layer of nesting, which was not accounted for in a relative path.  :facepalm:
