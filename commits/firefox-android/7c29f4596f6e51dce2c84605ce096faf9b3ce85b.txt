[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4975 - Disable build optimization to support instrumented tests

The test framework is expected to be configured with "-PdisableOptimization"
to signal that build optimizations should be disabled.

When running UI automated tests on release builds "shrinkResources" and
"minifyEnabled" should not be used to prevent linkage issues in the test code.
