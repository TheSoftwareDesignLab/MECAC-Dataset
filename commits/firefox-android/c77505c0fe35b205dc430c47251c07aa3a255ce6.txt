[components] New AccountManager component, update samples apps to use it

This introduces an account manager component, and updates two sample apps
to use it - logins and history sync.

AccountManager encapsulates state transitions exposed by Rust liblogins,
and provides a simple observable API and a few public methods to interact
with a FirefoxAccount.

Internally it's implemented as a state machine. Consumers are expected to
handle interactions with a web view that are necessary to complete an OAUTH flow.
