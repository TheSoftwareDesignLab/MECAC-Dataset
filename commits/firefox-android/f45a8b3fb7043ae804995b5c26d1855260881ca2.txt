[fenix] Fix https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/5067 - Refactor ShareController to use SendTabUseCases

Navigation between app fragments uses ShareTab as arguments. The newly used
SendTabUseCases uses TabData which is not Parcelable.
For minimal changes we'll keep both data classes and ShareController will know
how to map between the two.
Removed the `sessionId` property of ShareTab as it isn't needed anymore.
