[fenix] Ensure logins deletion (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/12507)

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11227 - Cleanup saved logins list when one is selected

Selecting a saved login will open a detail screen for it from where users can
change details or even delete that particular login.
After the change is made the user is brought back to the list of saved logins
where for a brief moment (< 1s) until we get a new response from
passwordsStorage.list() the user can see and even interact with the old list
of items, which may still contain the just deleted one.

To avoid users seeing obsolete logins or even interacting with them (selecting
a previosuly deleted item will result in a crash) we will clean the list of
logins just before the selected login is opened in the detailed view.
When returning for a brief moment the users may see the "loading" UX until
passwordsStorage.list() returns the up-to-date list of logins to display.

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11227 - Refactor SavedLoginsView to be closer to MVI

- Interactors should only get passed other Interactors or Controllers as
dependencies to which they should delegate user actions.
- Controllers should hold most of the business logic and get passed all final
dependencies they need to do their job.
