[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5235 - Update the style of browser menu item

This commit override Mozac.Browser.Menu.Item.Text style in order to use the same text color
for both themes(light and dark)
request_desktop_check_menu.xml was removed because its unused and was binded to the old style
of menu item, which also doesn't exists anymore
Toolbar background was updated because the url is unreadable in custom tab
