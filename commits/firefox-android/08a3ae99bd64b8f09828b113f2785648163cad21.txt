[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11004: Fix invisible text on migration UI

For some text and colors, we were using the default styling where
possible. These styles contain references that react to theme changes
like dark mode. Since the migration UI does not respect these changes,
we should not use them.
