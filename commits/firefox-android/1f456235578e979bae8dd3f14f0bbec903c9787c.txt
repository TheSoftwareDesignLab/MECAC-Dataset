[components] Create new menu2 component

browser-menu v2: A new browser menu designed to work with lib-state.

This introduces a new API using immutable data classes to represent
options. Stateful functionality like the two-state button is replaced
with swapping out data classes and submitting a new list of options.

Internally this uses a recycler view and the view holders intentionally
do not map 1:1 to data classes. This way we can use different views
based on properties instead of introducing all new classes for every
combination of properties.
