[focus] import_strings_and_create_pull_request.sh: Do not update checkout (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1700)

There's no need to update the checkout inside the script. This will be
done by taskcluster. Not doing this in the script has also the
advantage that the script can run locally without resetting the state
of the local checkout.
