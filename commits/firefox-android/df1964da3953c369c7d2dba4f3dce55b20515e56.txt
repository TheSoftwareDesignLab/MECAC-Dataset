[focus] Handle Content-Disposition header correctly (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/1165)

This commit copies a method from android.webkit.URLUtil
and modifies it to handle the Content-Disposition header
correctly.

Quoted strings now also support backslash-escaped characters
and RFC 5987 is implemented to support UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1
encoded filenames.

Furthermore, tests have been added for various kinds of
Content-Disposition header values.
