[fenix] Refactor History types to eliminate nullability

This introduces a separate HistoryDB type at the PagedHistoryProvider
layer, that doesn't need to deal with positions. Positioning logic in
HistoryDataSource becomes a type conversion between the new type and an
existing History type that UI and ItemKeyedDataSource API is written against.

With this refactor, we entirely eliminate nullability from these types.
