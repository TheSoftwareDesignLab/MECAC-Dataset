Bug 1857553 - [a11y] Mark up the Review Checker highlights as lists.

Before, when the screen reader was used, all highlights were announced
as static texts.

Now by using collectionInfo and collectionItemInfo, informations like
location and the position of the highlight in the list and the size
of the list are announced for each category of highlights and for each
highlight.
