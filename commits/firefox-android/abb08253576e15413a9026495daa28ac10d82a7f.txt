[components] Closes: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/126: Remove or rename View.layoutDirection
I proceeded  to remove this extension property, we have the same behavior as the one provided by view.getLayoutDirection (added on added in API level 17), this method was added on ViewCompat to provide backward support for API level less than 17 and our minSdkVersion is 21, so we're good to go.

I verified that it wasn't use in the following consumers repositories:
* firefox-tv
* focus-android
* mozilla-tw/Rocket
