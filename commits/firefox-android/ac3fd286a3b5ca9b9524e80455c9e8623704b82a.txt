[focus] build.gradle: Only add adjust dependency to focus flavored builds. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/411)

Unfortunately gradle doesn't seem to support dependencies only for specific variants
like focusReleaseCompile. Instead I'm going to enable minify/proguard in a follow-up
patch to remove unneeded code again.
