[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/6230 - Restore the searches measurement in core ping

The searches measurement was inadvertently removed in the transition to Glean.
The Data Science team requested to restore the old functionality until all the
new Glean events are ready to supersede the old telemetry.
