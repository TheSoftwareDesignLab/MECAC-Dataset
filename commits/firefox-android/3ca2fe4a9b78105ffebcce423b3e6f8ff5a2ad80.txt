[focus] WIP: ensure we don't query search engine data without init() (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/405)

awaitLoadingSearchEnginesLocked() will hang if no one called init()
first. We might as well crash the whole app in this case.

I wonder if there's a cleaner/more reliable way of doing this, rather
than using a boolean flag.
