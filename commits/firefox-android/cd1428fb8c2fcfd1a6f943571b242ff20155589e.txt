Bug 1862536 - Add a Nimbus variable for Firefox Suggestion types.

This commit adds:

* An `awesomebar-suggestion-provider` Nimbus feature to a new
  component-specific manifest in the `feature-fxsuggest` component.
* An `available-suggestion-types` variable for that feature, which
  holds a map of all available suggestion types that the
  `FxSuggestSuggestionProvider` can return.

This lets us toggle suggestion types remotely as part of our
experiments.
