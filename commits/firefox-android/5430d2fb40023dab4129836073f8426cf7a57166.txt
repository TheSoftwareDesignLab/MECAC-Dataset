[components] Update Flank to v21.08.0

https://github.com/Flank/flank/releases/tag/v21.08.0

21.08.0 supports an `executeWithRetry` in `ftl.client.google.AppDetailsKt` which is causing frequent `503` error timeouts in UI tests on Firebase. This is a result of our large APKs. Google is also rolling out a fix based on the current working theory that this is an internal deadline being exceeded in the next several days.
