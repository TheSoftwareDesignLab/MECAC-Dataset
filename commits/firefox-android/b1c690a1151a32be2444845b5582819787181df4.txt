[focus] Make sure webview is retrievable before URL loading (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/333)

Our external intent handling requires access to the webview (it needs
to be able to open error or fallback pages). If isWebViewAvailable==false,
then WebFragment.getWebView() returns null, which means
BrowserFragment.handleExternalUrl() gets a null WebView, and it therefore
doesn't call the external URL handling code. Hence we need to make
sure that getWebView() can return the current WebView before calling
loadUrl().
