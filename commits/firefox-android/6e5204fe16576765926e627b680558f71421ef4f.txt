[focus] Load wordmark as data: URI for about: (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/265)

Loading resources into Android webview is severely broken.
1. For webview < 53, file://android_res/ only works if
   app_ID==app_package (which isn't the case for debug/beta builds)
2. For webview >= 53, file://android_res/ only works if
   app_ID.contains(app_package) - that isn't the case for Klar.
3. android.resource:// URLs aren't supported at all (at least not
   in the up to date webview version I tested)

Loading the png into a data: URI is hacky, but works reasonably reliably.
It probably won't scale to more complicated pages, but works well enough
for the single image in about:.
