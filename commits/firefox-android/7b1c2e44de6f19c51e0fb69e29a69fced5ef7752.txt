Bug 1816867 - Ensure Pocket topics selections are properly shown

A past refactoring resulted in the functionality still working as intended - no
more than 8 topics being selectable at a time but when a topic would be
automatically deselected this would not show - that topic would still be
displayed as selected.

Moving the implementation to a new `FilterChip` Compose api fixes the UI issue
and also allows for more idiomatic code and fixes a previously disabled UI test
