[focus] Only move Twitter/FB from "Disconnect"/"Social"

I forgot to implement the filtering of other sites in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/20. Only
Twitter and FB remain, and are moved into "Social". Google is added in a
separate list (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/94). That only leaves itisatracker.com which is unneeded.
