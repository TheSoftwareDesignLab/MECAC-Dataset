[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/23697: Avoid NPEs while pasting URLs from the clipboard

It's possible for clipboard contents to have changed in the time between we've constructed
the onClick listeners and when they're actually invoked. Code before assumed that 'text'
will be not-null, and would crash otherwise. With this change, we're capturing contents of
the clipboard before constructing onClick handlers (while also asserting correct behaviour
of 'ClipboardHandler').

With this change, we'll log an error if we were told that clipboard contains a URL, but immediately
after that check 'text' was actually null. This would indicate one of two things:
- issues within the ClipboardHandler
- changing contents of the ClipboardHandler within a tiny time window between our check and querying
