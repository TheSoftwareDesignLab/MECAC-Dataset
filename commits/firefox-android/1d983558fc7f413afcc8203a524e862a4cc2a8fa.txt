[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/26172 - New CFR popup composable

This will allow for pinpoint accuracy when anchoring and resolve any color
disparities between the popup body and the indicator arrow by having everything
drawn programmatically as one shape.

Because of the async nature of the values for insets and screen rotation
immediately after an orientation change the popup will automatically get
dismissed to prevent any anchoring issues.
While not ideal the effect of this is better than accepting layout issues after
orientation changes and is the same approach used for other of our popups.
