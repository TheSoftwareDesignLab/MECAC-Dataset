[focus] Use launchMode=singleTask so that settings/info stay in same task
 (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/251)

If we use singleInstance, then any new activities are launched in a new
task. I.e. Settings/About/Help/Rights are launched in a new task, if you
then switch apps and return to focus, then exit the Settings/About/Help/
Rights activities, you return to the home screen since the MainActivity
isn't in the same task/backstack.
