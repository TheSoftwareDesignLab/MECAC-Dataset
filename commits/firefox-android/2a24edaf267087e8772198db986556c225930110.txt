[fenix] No issue: Add new cron target task for legacy API UI tests

Setups up a new daily cron task to run select UI tests on API 28 (we’ll call it legacy). We don’t necessarily want to invoke Flank twice (serial) with a different configuration (FTL APIs dont support API splitting per test-target) on event CI but we do want them running elsewhere (cron).
