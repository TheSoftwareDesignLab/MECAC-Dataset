[fenix] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/21871 - Eagerly update UI state after search group removal

Before this patch, this was the behavior - 'remove' button is clicked, we'd ask
the storage to remove metadata (on its IO thread), then navigate to Home
Screen.

This resulted in a race we could end-up on the Home Screen before delete
finishes, so the search groups do not appear to be removed (but,
refreshing the Home Screen again shows that they are removed).

This also resulted in an unnecessary navigation which felt very janky
(screen will "scroll" to the top) and was way more work than necessary.

After this patch, we:
 - dispatch two actions (on browserstore, on homefragmentstore) which
   remove the search groups from any relevant in-memory state; any UI bound to
   this state will be automatically "refreshed"
 - no longer navigate as part of the remove action, so the UI doesn't
   move and removal happens "in-place"
