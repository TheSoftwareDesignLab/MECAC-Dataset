Bug 1819727 - Fix imports for FxNimbusMessaging in UI tests

When #1097 landed, it upstreamed the Nimbus messaging code to components
and changed the namespace for those generated classes.

Surprisingly, CI didn't rebase the original patch for bug 1819727 before
landing it, leading to the main branch being busted.

This patch fixes that breakage.
