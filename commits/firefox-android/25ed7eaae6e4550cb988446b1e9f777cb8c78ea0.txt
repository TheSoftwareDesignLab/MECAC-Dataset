We apply various layout changes to the "handle" UI in the tabs tray when
switching modes. It isn't quite clear to my, why we do this, if it's
really needed to meet the end result, and if there is a better way.

For now, we're simplying moving over that logic that we can re-evaluate
at a later time.
