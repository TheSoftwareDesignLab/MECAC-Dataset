[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/26723 - Ensure wallpapers are set on the main thread

Using Dispatchers.IO allowed the observer to react faster to wallpaper state
updates but caused issues with updating the wallpaper in fragment layout.

Using Dispatchers.Main.immediate gives us a bit slower reaction time but still
faster than Dispatchers.Main and allows us to still execute before the fragment
is visible.
