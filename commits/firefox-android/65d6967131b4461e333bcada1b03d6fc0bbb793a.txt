[focus] lint: Correctness: miscellaneous (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/108)

1. use apply for async SharedPref writing instead of commit()
2. SuppressLint("InflateParams") for inflation where the View is being
   placed into a popup/dialog (where the root view params are ignored
   anyway).
3. Ignored dperecated for android:singleLine=true. We already use
   android:maxLines=1, but singleLine is needed for correct fading.
