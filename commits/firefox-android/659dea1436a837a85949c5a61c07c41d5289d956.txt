[fenix] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/1022: Auto-publication workflow for android-component

This patch enabled support for an auto-publication workflow for android-components.

It automates a common pattern seen in local development:

Old way:
- after every change in a-c, publish it locally with a unique version (bumping it manually)
- manually modify Fenix to consume a custom version of a-c from a mavenLocal repository

New way:
- set a flag in fenix's local.properties to enable auto-publication
- run Fenix builds after making changes to a-c. Changes in a-c will be automatically picked up.

Note that no changes are necessary to any Fenix files other than a single flag in local.properties.
Manually bumping android-components version is also not necessary.
