[fenix] Make sure reconnect item is displayed in HomeMenu in case of account problems

AccountObserver listeners were being triggered correctly, however, during every time
we open HomeFragment, home menu gets re-created, which causes us to re-run the initialization
block. Before this patch, the init block would never touch the account manager.
After this patch, it will query it if account manager has already been initialized.
