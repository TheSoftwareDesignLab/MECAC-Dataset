[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5452 - Set sessions FAB visibility depending on number of tabs

This comes to resolve an issue in which ResizableKeyboardViewDelegate would set
all it's "viewsToHide" to visible after the keyboard is hidden not checking in
any way of they should be visible based on their internal state or not.
Chose to not expose this part of the state to the delegate and handle the
visibility change in the sessions FAB.
