[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/25281 - Improve stories impressions recording.

This fixes the following two scenarios resulting in improper recordings:
- sponsored stories were recorded as shown as part of the impressions recording
for all the stories (both recommended and sponsored). Separated the two.
- sponsored stories were not recorded as shown if the user doesn't scroll.
This could happen if just toggling categories which would result in a new list
of stories to show. Will recheck after the time to settle if the composable is
shown.
