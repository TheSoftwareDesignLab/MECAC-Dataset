Revert "Bug 1816945 - part 2: Run `test-components` on untrusted PRs too"

This reverts commit 0a97e6a3c95cbbfe7d3e268140051ca87a56d830.

I made a mistake yesterday. We actually don't want to run these UI tests on
untrusted PRs because of secrets. The original implementation in
https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/113 was the right one.
