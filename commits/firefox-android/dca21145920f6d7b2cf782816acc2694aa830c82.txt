[focus] Move startup perf measurements to a background thread

Similar fix as done on Fenix: https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/26165
Should avoid loading the Glean core library too early, but still records
the data just fine.

Note that Focus doesn't record startup time, so nothing to delay there.
