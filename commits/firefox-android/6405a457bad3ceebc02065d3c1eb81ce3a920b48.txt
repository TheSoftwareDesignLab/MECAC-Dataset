[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/12855 - New CFR composable

This upstreams the CFR composable already used on Fenix allowing it to be
reused on other projects also.
The setup process requires quite a few parameters because as it is highly
customizable supporting different indicator orientations or positionings
in relation to the anchor and also supporting RTL.
