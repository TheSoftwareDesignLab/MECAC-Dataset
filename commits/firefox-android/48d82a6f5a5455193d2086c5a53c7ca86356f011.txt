[focus] MainActivity: Call FLAG_SECURE early. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/325)

I can't reproduce https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/325 locally but we want to set the SECURE flag as early as
possible and not do a bunch of UI stuff first. Let's see if this might fix this.
