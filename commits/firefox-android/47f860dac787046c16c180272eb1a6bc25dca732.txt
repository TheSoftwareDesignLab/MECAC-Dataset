[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/10686 - Use the AC custom behavior for both the top and bottom toolbars

This comes to unify the experience (with improvements but also specific issues)
for the url toolbar irrespective of it being placed at the bottom or at the top
Going further this will ease development and ensure the best UX for users.
