[focus] Add taskcluster scripts to import strings and create pull requests.

Those scripts can run on taskcluster and will import strings, create a
commit, push them to the bot's repository and create a new pull request
to be merged by a human.

Example merge request:

This is not running automatically yet. If this is proving to be useful
I want to run it regularly via taskcluster's hooks service [1].

Later this commit could be merged automatically. But for now I think
it's a good idea to let a human review it first.
