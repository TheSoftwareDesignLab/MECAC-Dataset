[focus] Add separate product flavor for distinction between Focus and Klar builds. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/71)

Our new configuration is based on:
* build type (debug, beta, release)
* product flavor (focus, klar)
* engine flavor (webkit, gecko)

We only create focus/debug builds for the gecko engine flavor.
