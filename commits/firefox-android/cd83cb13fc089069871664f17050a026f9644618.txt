[components] Apply org.mozilla.android plugin to manage app-service repository requirements

With release of appservices' 0.20.2, repository mirroring is no longer used.
This means we need to declare dependency on the custom repository where it's
currently published. We do this via a shared plugin, so that this dependency
management is easier down the road.
