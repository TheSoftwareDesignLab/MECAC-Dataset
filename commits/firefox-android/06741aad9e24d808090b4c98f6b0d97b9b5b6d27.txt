[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4975 - Allow instrumented tests to run on builds other than debug

The test framework is expected to be configured with "-PtestBuildType=nightly",
"-PtestBuildType=beta" or "-PtestBuildType=release" to signal that automated
tests should run against the other than debug build types.

It is useful to run an automated test suite on each build, not only on the
debug ones to ensure all features are tested, even the ones behind build type
branches in code and that no uplifts are causing regressions.
