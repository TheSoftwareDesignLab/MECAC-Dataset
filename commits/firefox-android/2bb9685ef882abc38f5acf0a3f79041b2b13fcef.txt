[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/19938: Remove a11y workaround for tab tray new tab button.

Historically, button was introduced in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/commit/a3dc565c10a16b6693063daf11bd004467783b08,
because FAB was not selectable by a11y in previous implementation of tab tray.
