[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/18830 - Remove card nickname from credit card editor (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/18891)

* Removed all views with regards to credit card nickname. Removed the TextInputLayout and TextInputEditText where information would be typed in. Also removed the credit card nickname title text view. I added a margin of 16 dp to the bottom ConstraintLayout that houses the delete, cancel, and save buttons as requested.
