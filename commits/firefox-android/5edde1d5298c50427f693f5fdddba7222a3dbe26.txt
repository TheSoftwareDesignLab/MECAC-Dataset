Bug 1873511 - New `supportedLanguages` and `translationError` on TranslationsState, with TranslateExceptionAction Refactor

This patch adds the additional state information of `supportedLanguages` and `translationError` to `TranslationsState`. The `supportedLanguages` are the languages the translation engine supports for translating for use in UI dropdowns. `translationError` is any error that occurred relating to translating.

`supportedLanguages` is currently set via an action that indicates the intention to translate on the new `EngineMiddleware` addition of `TranslationsMiddleware`. This patch also adds a new `TranslationOperation` of `FETCH_TO_AND_FROM_LANGUAGES` to indicate the process of getting `supportedLanguages`.

`translationError` is added to the `TranslationsState` to store errors as they arise. `TranslateExceptionAction` is also refactored from using the generic `Throwable` to the new `TranslationError` to accommodate `supportedLanguages` and better general error handling.O_AND_FROM_LANGUAGES` to indicate the process of getting `supportedLanguages`.
