[focus] Respect viewport settings (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/461)

This mirrors Chrome behaviour (on Firefox, the white border on the right
hand side is removed, and text is larger/the page is zoomed in - in both
browsers there's no horizontal scrolling after first loading the page,
which is what this patch enables in Focus).
