[focus] Remove individual selector instead of entire rule if possible (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/529)

Some sites use a, a:visited [etc] { /*stuff*/ }. Removing the entire
rule means we break content beyond just removing visited link styling,
instead we can just modify the selector and remove the offending
:visited components.
