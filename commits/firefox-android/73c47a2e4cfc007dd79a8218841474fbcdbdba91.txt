[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/81: Add ui.fonts component with roboto fonts.

I tested this by importing the new fonts file into firefox-tv and
verifying that each string correctly displays a font with a different
appearance.

To create the new module, I cp -r ui-colors and imported the resulting
module. Notably, I didn't add a .iml file like colors has, but I think these
modules should be generated by the gradle configuration anyway so iml is
unnecessary.
