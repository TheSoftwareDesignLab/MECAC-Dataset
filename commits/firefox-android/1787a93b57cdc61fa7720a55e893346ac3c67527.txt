[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/5872 & https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/6075: Set TabHeader buttons to invisible instead of gone.

At least one button has to be invisible instead of gone to keep layout height.
Tabs overflow button kept gone to avoid empty space on view end in private mode.
