[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/22534 - Show history highlights and groups in "Recently visited" (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/22535)

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/22534 - Update homescreen section name to "Recently visited"

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/22534 - Show both history highlights and groups in Recently visited

For now the metadata groups don't support scoring so as an interim solution we
will show up to 9 items, evenly distributes, first favoring groups sorted by
date then history highlights pre-sorted by default.

Tapping a history highlight will switch to it's already open tab if available
or create a new one in which to load it if needed.

A "Remove" option will also be available for history highlights to remove it
from the screen and also from history.
Currently removing a group / highlight will not query new ones to again show up
to 9 items, this will be implemented separately.

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/22534 - Rename and refactor historymetadata to recentvisits

The updated feature supports more than history metadata so updating the overall
naming scheme seems needed.
To signal that this is a homescreen feature the entire package is moved to home

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/22534 - Update UI tests to account for the new items space on the screen

Saw failures about not finding the collection section on screen.
This is probably happening because w are now adding the recent visits to
homescreen above the collections section pushing it off screen.

Since the collections might be obstructed by the toolbar shown on top as a
quick solution we'll scroll to the next homescreen section so that the
collections will be shown above in their entirety.

* Update app/src/main/java/org/mozilla/fenix/home/recentvisits/RecentVisitsFeature.kt
