[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/8356 - Null check down event in BrowserGestureDetector

Last ditch effort to prevent against crashes caused by ACTION_DOWN event being
null in GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener#onScroll.

We can use the fact that the parameters are platform types and so can consider
the first parameter (that should be the ACTION_DOWN MotionEvent) being null so
that we won't automatically crash in such situations.
This will result in the toolbar not being animated as a result of a scroll
gesture by the user.

More investigations about why the ACTION_DOWN event is null are to be done in
android-components/issues/8552.
