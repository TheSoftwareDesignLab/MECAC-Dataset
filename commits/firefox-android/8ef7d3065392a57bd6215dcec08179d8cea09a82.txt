[focus] Pass session object to AverageLoadTimeObserver. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/2229)

When running UI tests it sometimes has happened that there was no "current session"
anymore at the time a page finished loading. In addition to that there can be
multiple concurrent sessions - so keeping track of the session this observer
observes should make this more robust.
