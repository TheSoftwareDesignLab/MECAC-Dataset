[fenix] 16373 Count the # of inflations done on startup (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/16778)

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16373: Added performance Inflater to counter # of inflations

This class is quite straight forward. The only thing that I have to point out is the onCreateView method. It usually
calls its super if you don't override it. The problem with that is that the super.onCreateView actually uses
android.view. as a prefix for the XML element it tries to inflate. So if we have an element that isn't part
of that package, it'll crash. As I said in the code, a good example is ImageButton. Calling android.view.ImageButton
will make the app crash. The method is implemented the same way that PhoneLayoutInflater does (Another example
is the AsyncLayoutInflater)

* For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/16373: Added test for PerformanceInflater

This test got quite awkward / complicated fast.  I wanted to test the  to make sure we don't break *any* of our layouts
and to do so, I decided to just retrieve all our XML in our /res/layout folder. However, this gets quite a bit outside of a unit test scope.
The point was to get every layouts and get their LayoutID through the resources using the testContext we have. It gets even weirder, since some
of the XML tags have special implementation in android. One of them is the <fragment> tag. That tag actually is inflated by the OS using the Factory2
that the Activity.java implements. In order to get around the fragment issue, we just return a basic FrameLayout since the system LayoutInflater doesn't deal
won't ever get a <fragment> tag to inflate. Another issue was the <merge> tag. In order to inflate those, you need 1) a root view and 2) attach your view to it.
In order to be able to test those layouts file, I had to create an empty FrameLayout and use it as the root view for testing. Again, I know this is beyond the spirit of a unit test but if we use this inflater, I think it should make sure that no layouts are broken by it.

This allows PerformanceInflater to be called in every inflation to keep track of the number of inflations we do.

* For #167373: Changed the LayoutInflater cloneInContext to take this instead of inflater

The inflater parameter is set on the first call from the OS from  the Window object. However, the activity itself sets multiple factories on the inflater
during its creation (usually through AppCompatDelegateImpl.java). This means that, once we initially set the inflater with a null check, we pass an inflater
that has no factory initially. However, since we keep a reference to it, when cloneInContext was called, it cloned the inflater with the original inflater
which didn't have any factories set up. This meant that the app would crash on either browserFragment creation or any thing that required appCompat (such as
ImageView and ImageButton). Now, passing itself with a cloneInContext means we keep all the factories initially set by the activity or the fragment.
