[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/17686 - Use a custom behavior to scroll InfoBanner with the top toolbar

Previously when the toolbar was on top the banner was inflated in the toolbar's parent - an AppBarLayout.
After migrating to use a custom behavior for scrolling the toolbar and not use
anymore the AppbarLayout for this we needed a new solution.
Using a new behavior to keep this banner in sync with the y translation of the
toolbar gives us most of the old behavior back.
