[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4975 - Auto-publish android-components and application-services

To ease local development ands avoid going by the "publishToMavenLocal" route
developers can set the location of the other 2 Mozilla projects relative to
Focus or an absolute one by setting "autoPublish.android-components.dir=..."
and "autoPublish.application-services.dir=..." so that any changes made in
these projects will be automatically used when Focus is built.
