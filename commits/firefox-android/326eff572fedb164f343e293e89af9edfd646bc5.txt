[focus] Do fragment work on onResumeFragments() instead of onResume() (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/288)

FragmentActivity (which MainActivity extends, via AppCompatActivity),
specifies that this is the correct way of doing fragment
transactions, as state might still be saved during onResume(). This
should hopefully avoid any crashes when setting up the BrowserFragment.
