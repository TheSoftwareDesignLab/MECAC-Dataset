[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/21294: remove allocations in Fact.toEvent.

This commit was generated primarily by a macro that:
- appends `== component &&`
- appends `== item`
- (if applicable) Skips to the ending brace
- Go down one line and move cursor to the front of the line to prep for repeat

My only intervention was to skip extra lines to line it up to run again
and specify how many times in a row it should run.

The `to` in this code is an infix function that calls instantiates a
Pair under the hood. Subjectively observed, when this method is called
it generally hits the else case so 35 Pairs are instantiated each call -
that's 560 bytes. This method is called frequently - for example, an estimated
4 times each time a letter is typed on the homescreen and a measured 116 times
in a simple navigation (see the issue). The latter generates an estimated
63.4 KiB.

It was straightforward to remove these allocations so that's what this
change does.

The primary risk from this change is that it's difficult to test each
case to ensure it's working.
