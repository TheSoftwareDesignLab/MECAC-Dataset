[focus] Don't read preference value until we have to

This is a followup to https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/20. On my 5.1 device, and "App Restriction"
preference is changed when a WebView is opened. We would then crash,
since that pref is a String. The same preference doesn't get changed
(and/or isn't ever set) on a 7.0 device.
