[focus] android2po: avoid CDATA in po file by readding on xml creation

This approach means we can't use Android html-style formatting for
any controls, since getString() and getText() will always return
html.

The input strings.xml MUST have CDATA for any html. If CDATA isn't present,
then the original english strings will be stripped of html formatting,
but the translated non-english strings will have CDATA and contain
html formatting.
