[focus] Copy disconnect lists in gradle instead of python script (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/215)

We don't do any preprocessing on Android, our python script merely
copies the lists - we can do that in gradle and avoid dependencies
on specific python versions that way.

(This script is originally from focus-ios, which needs to preprocess
 lists into the iOS content blocking list format. iOS uses a
 regex based list, the Android implementation just parses the raw input
 and does trie-based url matching.)
