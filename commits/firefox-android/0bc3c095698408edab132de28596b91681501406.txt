Bug 1824379 - When adding a new login add it to the shared LoginsFragmentStore

This brings multiple advantages over the current implementation:
- we're not creating a new instance of SavedLoginsFragment
- we avoid a deeper and more expensive layer of caching the just added login
through SyncableLoginsStorage and use the in memory data.
- we avoid having to intercept the back press to control navigation
