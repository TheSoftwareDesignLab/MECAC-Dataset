[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/24897 - Move clickable handling to the parent in ExpandableListHeader

ExpandableListHeader provides a consistent UX for similar usecases.

Needed to update it to allow clicks to be handled by a parent and it not
stealing the click or shown an improper Indication.
