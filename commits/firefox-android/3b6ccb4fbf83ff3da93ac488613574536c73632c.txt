[components] Closes https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/728: Invoke onNavigationStateChange sooner

We're only waiting until the page is fully loaded until we call
onNavigationStateChange, which causes the UI components to seem slow.

Now, we make the call when we receive a title from the SystemEngine.
