[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/18616 - Update browser and toolbar layout when toolbar is at top

FindInPageIntegration which already updated the toolbar to make room for the
find in page bar now receives more data based on which it will be able to
better update the layout of BrowserFragment to to support showing the find in
page bar.
