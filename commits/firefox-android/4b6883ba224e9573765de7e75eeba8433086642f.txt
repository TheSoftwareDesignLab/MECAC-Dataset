[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/8305 - BrowserToolbarBottomBehavior - browserToolbar null check

In some scenarios BrowserToolbarBottomBehavior could be set for a layout which
doesn't contain a BrowserToolbar or where such a view has Visibility.GONE
(like in the case of PWAs).
Protect against the behavior still trying to animate the toolbar which at that
time might be be null.
