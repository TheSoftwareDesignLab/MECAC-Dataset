[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/26830 - Allow the Pocket stories to scroll to the edges of the screen

Restore using LazyRow's "contentPadding" property to add padding to just the
items while the entire section is allowed to extend to the edges of the screen
and so have enough room to draw items shadows without them being clipped.
