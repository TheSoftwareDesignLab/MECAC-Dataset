Seems to be another intermittent issue with downloading Gradle. 

```Kotlin
Downloading https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
WARNING | /etc/localtime does not point to zoneinfo-compatible timezone name

Exception in thread "main" java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe (Write failed)
