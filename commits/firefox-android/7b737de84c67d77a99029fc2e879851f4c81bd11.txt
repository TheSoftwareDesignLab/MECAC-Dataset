[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/4926 - Add unit tests and fix regressions

Add unit tests for MvpBrowserMenuController.kt
Add Powered by item in custom tab menu
Refactor Reload toolbar menu item
Update input toolbar text color
Fixed Regression: Input toolbar text color became black when the
 app theme was switched to light.
For now we don't have specific support for light theme so it
should be always gray
