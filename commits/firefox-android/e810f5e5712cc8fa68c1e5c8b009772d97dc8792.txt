[components] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/10638 - Remove reflective access to "mSpanSlop" and "mMinSpan"

Removed reflective access to non-public SDK APIs controlling the sensitivity of
the gesture detector following which sparingly and for very short time a
pinch/spread to zoom gesture might be identified first as a scroll gesture and
move the toolbar a little before snapping to it's original position.
