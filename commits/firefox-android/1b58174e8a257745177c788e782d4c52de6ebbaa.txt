[fenix] Issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/418: Basic Firefox Accounts integration

This patch integrates relevant a-c components, and updates the current Preferences
UI to allow signing-in and displaying basic account information (email, displayName).

Currently there's no Accounts UI, and so singing out or otherwise interacting with the
account isn't possible.
