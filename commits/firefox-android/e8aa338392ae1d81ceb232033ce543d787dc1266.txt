[focus] Transform into single activity app. (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/24)

Instead of multiple activities we are now using multiple fragments inside MainActivity
(HomeFragment, UrlInputFragment, BrowserFragment). This makes navigating between the
different states much easier. Some animations need to be re-implemented now.
