Bug 1838317 - Autocomplete url suggestion regardless of letter case

The full site name should be suggested in the address bar
regardless of the capitalization of the input text (i.e.,
starting to type "you" or "You" or any other combination
of upper/lower case letters should still be autocompleted
to "youtube.com")
