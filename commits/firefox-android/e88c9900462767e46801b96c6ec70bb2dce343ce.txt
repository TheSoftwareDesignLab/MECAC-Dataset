[fenix] For issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/12400 - Refresh swiped collection tab view

Item is now refreshed by calling notifyDataSetChanged on the adapter when the last tab from the collection has been swiped away and the user cancels the deletion by pressing the cancel button from the dialog.
Also added a "wasSwiped" flag to onCollectionRemoveTab in order to check if the tab was deleted from a swipe action and not by pressing the "X" button.
