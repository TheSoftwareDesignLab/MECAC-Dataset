[components] Remove browser-search and migrate leftover functionality to feature-search.

Now that Fenix and Focus have migrated to using search functionality from the state in
BrowserStore (provided by feature-search), we can remove browser-search. The client
for search suggestions and the assets still lived in browser-search and this patch
moves those to feature-search too.
