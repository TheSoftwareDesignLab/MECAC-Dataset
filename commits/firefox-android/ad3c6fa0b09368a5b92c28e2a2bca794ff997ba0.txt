[focus] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/6542 - Open WindowRequest url in current tab if multitab is disabled

We'll catch the first `AddAddTabAction("about:blank")` action emitted when the
window request is consumed and:
- replace to use the EngineSession set for the window request
- open the url of the window request
in the current tab.
