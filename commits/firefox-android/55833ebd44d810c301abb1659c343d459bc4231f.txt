[focus] lint: use importantForAccessibility="no" for decorative items (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/108)

Without this we get ContentDescription warnings. These icons
are purely decorative (and in the case of focus_preference, aren't
even used - that layout was imported from Android and needs to retain
the icon for compatibility reasons).
