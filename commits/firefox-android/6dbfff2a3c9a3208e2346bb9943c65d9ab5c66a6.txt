[fenix] For https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/24040: App should not crash when the search widget is clicked while PIP mode is active (https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/pull/25410)

When the search event is from the search widget while PIP is active, the search fragment opens after the screen is unlocked. This avoids the issue of the search page opening in landscape mode and also the app doesn't crash.
