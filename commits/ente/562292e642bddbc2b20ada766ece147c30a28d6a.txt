fix: remove unsupported languages from language picker

Remove languages from _getLanguageName that don't have >90% translation
coverage and aren't in appSupportedLocales (Finnish, Korean, Arabic).
Also improve Chinese locale display.

- Removed fi, ko, ar cases that don't meet translation threshold
- Fixed Chinese locale handling to properly show "中文 (简体)" for zh_CN
- Ensures only properly translated languages appear in the picker
