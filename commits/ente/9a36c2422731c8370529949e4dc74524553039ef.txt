[destkop] Add windows icon variant

Generated from icon.png using https://www.icoconverter.com/

Even though the docs (https://www.electron.build/icons.html) say that the
icon.png should automatically get used, in practice it seems to generate start
menu icons that are blurry.

The recommendation from the maintainer
(https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/7328#issuecomment-1499884818)
is to provide an .ico variant that'll get used for Windows.

I'm not sure if it is necessary to also mention this explicitly in the build
config. From reading the docs
(https://www.electron.build/electron-builder.interface.windowsconfiguration#icon),
'build/icon.ico' should be the default, so trying first by just adding the file.
