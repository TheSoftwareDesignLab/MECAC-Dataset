Update screenshots

Updated the screenshots. Kept the overall idea the same (three screenshots, bottom clipped, roughly the same height and spacing). Switched from Android to iOS.

Also add light mode feature entry, + link to discord.

@vishnukvmd I tried various variations with/without frames, spacing, drop shadows on devices etc, light=>dark combinations and transitions but none sort of worked so decided to remain with the existing pattern. Variations are in Figma if you wish to take a look.

Pipeline:
- Export PNG from Figma keeping the color space in Display P3
- Optimize the PNG (from 1.5M to .5M, prev image was .2M) using pngquant (`brew install pngquant`).
