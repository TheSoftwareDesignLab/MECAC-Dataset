Add app bar boundary reporting for ungrouped galleries

When enableGrouping is false, galleries now wrap the app bar with
_AppBarWithBoundary to report top boundary for auto-scroll. This
ensures proper auto-scroll behavior in search results, cluster pages,
contact results, and magic result screens that display files without
time-based grouping.
