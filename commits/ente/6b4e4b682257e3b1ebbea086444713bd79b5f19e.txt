Fix: dark icon hard to see (#407)

## Type of Change

- [x] ✨ New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)

## Description

Fall-back to theme's icon-color when the icon-color is too light or
dark. Fixes #403

Logic
1. If RGB values are almost equal (`#000000`, `#0F0F11`, `#212121`,
`#27272A`, `#464949`, `#FFFFFF`)
2. Compute its luminance/brightness (cache this value as it is an
expensive task)
3. If its too bright or dark, return theme's icon-color

I've manually set the threshold values for brightness in light-theme to
be `0.7` and in dark-theme to be `0.05`
