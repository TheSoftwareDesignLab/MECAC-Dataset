Fix rotateVideo bounds calculation to respect video orientation

The rotateVideo method was not properly calculating video bounds when applying rotation, resulting in incorrect output dimensions. The issue occurred because the method ignored the video's preferredTransform (metadata rotation) and used simplistic hardcoded transforms.

Root cause:
- Used naturalSize directly without considering preferredTransform
- Started with CGAffineTransform.identity instead of preferredTransform
- Hardcoded rotation transforms that didn't account for existing orientation
- No bounds testing for proper video centering

Changes:
- Calculate orientedSize by applying preferredTransform to naturalSize
- Start transform chain with preferredTransform to respect existing orientation
- Rotate around the center of the oriented video (not natural size)
- Use bounds testing to calculate proper translation offsets
- Properly center the rotated video within the render size
- Match the same logic used in processVideo for rotation operations

This ensures rotateVideo produces the same correct output whether rotation is applied standalone or combined with crop operations.
