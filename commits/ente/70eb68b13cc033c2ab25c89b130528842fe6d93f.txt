Fix incorrect file deletion when widget unmounts during thumbnail loading

Previously, when _loadWithRetry returned null due to widget unmounting,
the code incorrectly assumed the local file was deleted and would remove
database references or delete the file. This could lead to data loss.

Changes:
- Add new WidgetUnmountedException to centralized exceptions.dart for reuse
- Throw WidgetUnmountedException instead of returning null when widget unmounts
- Handle WidgetUnmountedException separately in error handler with appropriate logging
- Still set _errorLoadingLocalThumbnail flag to prevent retry attempts

Using Exception instead of Error follows Dart conventions:
- Exceptions are for recoverable runtime conditions (like widget unmounting)
- Errors are for programming mistakes that shouldn't be caught

This ensures that widget unmounting is properly distinguished from actual
file access failures.
