[web][photos] Implement smart zoom behavior for TripLayout super clusters

- Add automatic zoom in when entering super clusters during timeline scrolling
- Add automatic zoom out when leaving super cluster areas
- Implement different transition behaviors based on distance:
  - Distant locations: full zoom out (2-4x) → pan → zoom in
  - Different super clusters: moderate zoom out (8-10x) → pan → zoom in
  - Same super cluster: smooth panning only
- Add zoom-aware positioning to maintain 20% from right edge at all zoom levels
- Pre-calculate super cluster info at optimal zoom to avoid recalculation during scroll
- Fix positioning issues where clusters appeared far left of map at high zoom
- Ensure proper zoom levels when transitioning between regular clusters and super clusters
