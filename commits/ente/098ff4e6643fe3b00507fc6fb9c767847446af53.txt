[auth] Add custom icon for EVE Online (#5078)

## Description

Added an Ente Auth custom icon for the EVE Online game service. I
followed the guidance
[here](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/auth/docs/adding-icons.md)
to add the entry for EVE Online.

The icon itself comes from [Wikimedia
Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EVE_online_logo.svg)
and was adapted to a square. I also added a custom hex color code to
ensure the logo is visible when using dark mode.

Noting that this is my first contribution as I've recently started using
Ente Auth, any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated :-)

## Tests

Visual change, no code changes.
