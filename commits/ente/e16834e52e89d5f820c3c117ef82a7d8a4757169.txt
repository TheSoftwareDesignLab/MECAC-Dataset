Remove unused styled jsx tag

This caused the lint to fail on CI

    > auth
    $ /home/runner/work/ente/ente/web/node_modules/.bin/tsc
    Error: src/pages/auth/index.tsx(125,20): error TS2322: Type '{ children: string; jsx: true; }' is not assignable to type 'ClassAttributes<HTMLStyleElement> & StyleHTMLAttributes<HTMLStyleElement> & { css?: Interpolation<Theme>; }'.
      Property 'jsx' does not exist on type 'ClassAttributes<HTMLStyleElement> & StyleHTMLAttributes<HTMLStyleElement> & { css?: Interpolation<Theme>; }'.
    error Command failed with exit code 2.

From reading the code, this CSS doesn't seem to be coming into effect. Then I
also did a test to verify that the auth app is correctly switching to a 2 column
layout even without this.
