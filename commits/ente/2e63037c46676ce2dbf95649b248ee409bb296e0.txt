Fix: Preserve HOTP counter when editing codes

Critical bug fix: Switching edits to Code.fromAccountAndSecret was resetting
HOTP counters to 0, causing codes to desynchronize from servers immediately
after any edit.

Changes:
- Added optional counter parameter to fromAccountAndSecret (defaults to 0)
- Counter is now included in rawData for HOTP codes
- Edit flow preserves original counter value (widget.code?.counter ?? 0)
- New codes default to counter=0 (correct for new HOTP codes)

This ensures HOTP codes remain synchronized with their servers after edits.
