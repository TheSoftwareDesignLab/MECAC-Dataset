Reorg of the entire photos documentation

This is major restructure of the photos documentation. Key points
* Added a getting started section to provide an easy to understand guide to setup Ente Photos
* Organised the features sections into subfolders so its easy to navigate and get to the right pages
* Changed the FAQ pages organisation to align with the features reorg
* Removed the troubleshooting section, and moved to within FAQ pages - some content went into specific pages, and others to a troubleshooting page
* Since we want to make sure all old links work, have created redirect pages for each of them to guide the user to new links
* Lots of redundant information across pages to make sure user lands at the right answer irrespective of how he browses
* Also added information from support ticket analysis of last 1 month (this is expected to be a continuous exercise)
* Added a style guide to ensure alignment in future edits

Request to reviewer - In general, there was a lot of outdated and incorrect information in the older version - I have tried to fix them. However, there are chances that some of them were skipped or I made a mistake. Please go through tha pages once before reviewing, especially the FAQ pages where the density of information is really high and things can be easy to miss

Impact
* Better navigation for users
* SEO/AEO impact since easier to crawl to specific information
* Easier for support to share links

Next Steps
* Lots of missing information/pages - image/video editing is not present. Cast on Apple TV, Discover section, etc. are few I could find. Has to be added as a separate effort
* Fix any reported issues that might have creeped through despite reviews
* Setup process to update this regularly - basis engineering work + support requests
