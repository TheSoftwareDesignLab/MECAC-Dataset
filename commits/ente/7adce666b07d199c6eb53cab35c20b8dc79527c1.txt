Refactor auto-scroll to use penetration-based power curve

Changes:
- Replace exponential formula with power curve (exponent 1.20)
- Add edge boost with 2.5x multiplier within 50px of screen edges
- Fix frame rate bug causing inconsistent visual speeds
- Hardcode all auto-scroll constants for simplicity
- Remove configurable settings dependency

The new implementation provides consistent visual scroll speed across
all refresh rates (60fps, 90fps, 120fps) and combines widget penetration
percentage with optional edge boost for intuitive acceleration.
