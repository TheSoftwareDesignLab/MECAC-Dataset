[auth] Fixing taskbar overlapping window panel (#4384)

## Description

Pull request was made because of some user percentage has taskbar
connected on top, so it overlaps auth window for WinApp at start.
After some measuring, I found that taskbar occupies:

- 50px on FHD with 125% scaling (standard values on some notebooks)
- 40px on FHD with 100% scaling
- 30px on FHD with 100% scaling and small taskbar icons
