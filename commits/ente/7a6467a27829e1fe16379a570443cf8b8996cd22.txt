Rename auth-daily to auth-beta-release with package watch paths

Changes:
- Rename workflow from auth-daily to auth-beta-release (more accurate naming)
- Add watch paths for all local package dependencies from auth's pubspec.yaml:
  - accounts, base, configuration, events, lock_screen, logging, network, strings, ui
- Update workflow title from "Daily release" to "Beta release"
- Workflow now triggers on changes to auth app OR any of its local dependencies

Auth version is already at 4.4.7+447 in pubspec.yaml.
