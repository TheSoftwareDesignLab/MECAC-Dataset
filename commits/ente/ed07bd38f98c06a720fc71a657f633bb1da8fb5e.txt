[auth] Add import from gallery button to initial setup screen

The initial setup screen was missing the "Import from Gallery" option,
which is a newly added feature. This commit adds a third button on the
setup screen that allows users to import 2FA codes by scanning QR codes
from images in their gallery.

Changes:
- Add onImportFromGalleryTap callback to HomeEmptyStateWidget
- Add "Import from Gallery" button (mobile-only) to the UI
- Wire up the callback to _importFromGalleryNative method

The button is positioned between "Scan a QR code" and "Enter setup key"
options, and is only shown on mobile platforms.
