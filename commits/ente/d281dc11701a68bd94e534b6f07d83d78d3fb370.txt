Remove manual video player switcher

Removes the UI for manually switching between native and MediaKit video players. Automatic error fallback to MediaKit is preserved when native player fails.

Changes:
- Remove manual player switch gesture area and tooltip button
- Remove el_tooltip package dependency
- Remove related localization string
- Keep automatic error fallback mechanism
