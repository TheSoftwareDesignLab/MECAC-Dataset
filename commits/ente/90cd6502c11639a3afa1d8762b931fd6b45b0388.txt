[desktop] Attempts to improve large drag drops on Windows

Trying to diagnose a customer issue where they reported that the renderer was
crashing when trying to drag and drop a 1TB folder on Windows. Fixing some
things that popped out in the memory allocations or the CPU time when testing
with a synthetic workflow (on macOS) - these may or may not fix their issue, but
these are anyway improvements and will only make things better.
