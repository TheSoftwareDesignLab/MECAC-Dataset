docs(rust): Add comprehensive conversion plan

- Document current implementation status
- Detail API client implementation steps
- List all remaining components with specifications
- Include testing strategy and migration notes
- Provide file structure reference for navigation
- Add implementation guidelines and environment variables

This plan enables any developer to understand the project state
and continue the conversion work from the current point.
