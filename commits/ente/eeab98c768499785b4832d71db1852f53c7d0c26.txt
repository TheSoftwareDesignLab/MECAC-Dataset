[server] Add a workaround for Safari to recognize Yubikeys

Safari just doesn't recognize the Yubikey (macOS/iOS, NFC/USB, doesn't matter)
if display name is set to the empty string. Safari's long description doesn't
care to mention this requirement:

Tested on localhost with Safari macOS. Will test on iOS post deployment.
