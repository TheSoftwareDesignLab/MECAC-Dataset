Guard dummy file operations behind feature flag

Only create dummy files and build allFilesWithDummies list when
swipe-to-select feature is enabled (internalUser && !limitSelectionToOne).
This avoids unnecessary object creation and list operations for
non-internal users, improving gallery initialization performance.
