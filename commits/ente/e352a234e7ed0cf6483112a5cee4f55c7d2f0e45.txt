Make UI adapt to bigger font sizes (#465)

## Description 

In a number of screens, there were issues with the UI when system font
size is increased and even hindering basic usability in some cases. This
includes,
- Text getting clipped
- Buttons not visible/clickable
- Alignment issues

All obvious issues that I came across when testing has been fixed in
this PR.
