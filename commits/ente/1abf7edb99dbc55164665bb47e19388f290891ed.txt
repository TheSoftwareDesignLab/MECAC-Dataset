[meta] Reduce the frequency of the sync translations cron

Every day is too much noise - we really only need this

- When a string gets changed in the source translation, in which case this
  workflow gets triggered automatically anyway.

- Before we do a new release (this doesn't automatically happen, but the
  workflow can be triggered manually if needed).

For now, reduce the frequency of the daily job to pull new translations from
Crowdin: now it'll only happen on Tuesdays and Fridays (just an arbitrary
choice).
