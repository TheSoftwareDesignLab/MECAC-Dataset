feat: add layout options for public link sharing

Add layout selection (grouped, continuous, trip) to public link management UI.
The layout option appears above "Allow adding photos" section and uses the
same UI pattern as link expiry. Layout data is stored in collection's public
magic metadata with "grouped" as the default option.
