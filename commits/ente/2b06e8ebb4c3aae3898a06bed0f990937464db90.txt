Fix isolate compatibility by using ui.instantiateImageCodec

Replace paint.decodeImageFromList with ui.instantiateImageCodec in the
isolate function. paint.decodeImageFromList requires PaintingBinding which
is not available in compute isolates, causing remote image rendering to
fail silently and fall back to V1.

ui.instantiateImageCodec works in isolates without requiring any binding
initialization.
