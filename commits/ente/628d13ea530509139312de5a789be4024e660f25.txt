[mobile][photos] Use sqlite async for fetching all files for search (#1391)

## Description

Using [sqlite_async](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite_async) has
increased query speed by about 5x and has removed GC logs like:
`Background concurrent copying GC freed 424845(20MB) AllocSpace objects,
183(4932KB) LOS objects, 37% free, 39MB/63MB, paused 144us,44us total
128.048ms`, which has improved performance of the app.

Tried using [sqlite3](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite3), which reduced
query speed by 10x and removed the GC log, but introduced some jank
since it blocks the UI.

Converting the fetched rows to `EnteFile` now runs on an isolate to
avoid blocking the UI.

## Tests

Did manual testing to see difference in jank.
