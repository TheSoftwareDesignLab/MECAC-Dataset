[web] Add ESLint to enforce HMR how vite likes it

Configuration changes taken from the vite starter (react-ts).

From the vite docs (https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc?tab=readme-ov-file#consistent-components-exports)

> For React refresh to work correctly, your file should only export React components.
>
> If an incompatible change in exports is found, the module will be invalidated.
> To make it easier to export simple constants alongside your component the module
> is only invalidated when their value changes.

While we're not currently using vite for our main apps, it would be worthwhile
to write code in a way that a future migration to it is painless if needed.

About the what and the why, the Gatsby docs are illuminating:
