[mob][photos] Set default crop selection to "Free" in video editor (#7543)

## Description

When opening the crop page in the video editor with no previous crop
selection, the UI now defaults to selecting "Free" instead of showing no
selection. This provides better UX by clearly indicating the current
freeform crop mode.
