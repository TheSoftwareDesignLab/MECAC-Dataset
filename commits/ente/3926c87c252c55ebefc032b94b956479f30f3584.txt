[web][photos] Update TripLayout styling and navigation behavior

- Change timeline dots and map markers to show green only for active location (not all covered locations)
- Add pan-only navigation when clicking between clusters in the same super cluster
- Update marker click logic to detect same super cluster navigation and use smooth panning instead of zoom out/in
