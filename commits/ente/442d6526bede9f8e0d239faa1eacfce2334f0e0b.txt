sopt color

something (I'm not sure what, but I think react-select itself) overrides the
color for the option's root element to white when displaying the search bar on
the search results screen itself. as a workaround, provide a explicit color to
the text.

steps to reproduce (light mode):
- search for something (all options look normal)
- select an option
- search for something on this results screen itself
- note how the search options titles are in white
