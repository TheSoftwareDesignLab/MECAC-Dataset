Fix auto-add people selection persisting after deselection

When deselecting all people from an album's auto-add feature, the UI
would continue to show people as selected even after saving. This was
caused by the saveConfig method only updating the database when
personIDs was non-empty, leaving the old config with selections intact.

Now properly deletes the config entry when all people are deselected,
ensuring the UI correctly reflects no selections on subsequent opens.

Fixes the issue where repeatedly deselecting and saving would not
update the selection state in the Edit auto-add people screen.
