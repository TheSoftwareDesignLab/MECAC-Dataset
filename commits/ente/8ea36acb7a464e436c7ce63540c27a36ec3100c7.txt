feat(rust): Initialize Rust CLI foundation with libsodium crypto

- Set up project structure mirroring Go CLI architecture
- Add dependencies with libsodium-sys-stable for all crypto operations
- Implement core crypto module with Argon2, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and Blake2b
- Create data models for accounts, files, and collections
- Set up Clap-based CLI framework with account, export, and version commands
- Add error handling with thiserror
- Configure for static linking to create standalone binaries

This establishes the foundation for converting the Ente CLI from Go to Rust,
with a focus on maintaining compatibility with existing libsodium-based crypto.
