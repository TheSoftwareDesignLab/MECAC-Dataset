[web] Add passkeys related translations

Obtained these strings from https://github.com/ente-io/accounts-web/blob/33faadf83ea6c39732ffd185fc4716b006612684/apps/accounts/public/locales/en/translation.json#L632

I didn't have a way of exhaustively ensuring that all strings are covered, but
I've tried to manually verify.

Once this is merged and translation files synced with Crowdin, I'll do another
PR to update the `local/**/translation.json` files within apps/accounts.
