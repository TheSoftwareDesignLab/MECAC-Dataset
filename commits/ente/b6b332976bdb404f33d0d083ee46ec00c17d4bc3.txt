Wrap tab bar in safe area

Earlier, the tab bar at the bottom of the main screen was wrapped in a
SafeArea widget so that it does not overlap the bottom hard to tap
regions on iPhones. Looks like that during the code changes for the
redesign, this SafeArea was lost.

Introduce the SafeArea back. Additionally, from a very quick glance it
seems that the stack and additional padding that had replaced the safe
area were not necessarily needed, so I've simplified the widget
structure. But this is a very quick and dirty example, I've only
tested that it looks visually okay on iPhone 13. Maybe there were
functional reasons for the old widgets, or maybe those were needed on
Android, so please consider this PR only as a starting point.
