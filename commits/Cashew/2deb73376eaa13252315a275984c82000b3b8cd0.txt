Navigation bar colors, overflow fixes

Loading indeterminate background color follows app bar color
Fixed snackbar background shadow and color on dark mode
Removed refresh pixels for navigation framework - removed the opacity jitter (however there still may be artifacts when the page is changed?)
Removed legacy transaction amount colors support (Debug Option)
Removed old Android Navbar support (Debug Option)
Navigation bar colors
2 Weeks of notifications scheduled instead of just 1
Can only request new icons if suggestion text field is not empty
Fixed overflow on category names for limits and entry
Added option to ask for note when selecting title for transaction
Fixed accent color resetting to always using system color
Status bar color reset to the proper color after launch
Centered translations help text if no icon
Navbar uses percent instead of animation controller value - if the height resizes the subtitle and background color does not follow the proper values of the scroll percentage (Only uses percentage if not using the small header)
The above is noticeable if selecting a budget history cycle from the line graph and the height resizes to fit content
