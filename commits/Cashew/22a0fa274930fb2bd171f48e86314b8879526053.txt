UI fixes, selected transactions mesh, initialization fixes

Fixed app bar top safe area
Corners mesh together on selected transactions when grouped together
Fixed landing page no wallet existed because database was not initialized - since it needs to be initialized after UI and translations are loaded
Amounts would start with "0" when performing calculations
Home page username formatting
Wallet selector undefined when app first loaded
