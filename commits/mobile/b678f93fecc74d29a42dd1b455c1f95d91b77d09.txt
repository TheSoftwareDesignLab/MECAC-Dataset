Add note to not translate "Puzzle Storm" and "Puzzle Streak"

I've seen some discussion about this on crowdin. Since the app does not have any translation keys for "Puzzle Streak" and "Puzzle Storm" (and neither does lichess.org), we should add notes that these should also not be translated in other texts.
