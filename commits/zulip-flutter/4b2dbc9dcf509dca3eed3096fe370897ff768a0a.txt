content test: Add ContentExample.globalTime

We already have a widget smoke test for global times. For that test,
it's convenient to declare the Markdown and HTML right alongside the
text, instead of here in this other file, so that's why
ContentExample.globalTime isn't invoked in
test/widgets/content_test.dart.
