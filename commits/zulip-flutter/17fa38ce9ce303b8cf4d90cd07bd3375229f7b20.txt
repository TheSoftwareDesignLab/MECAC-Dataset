dialog [nfc]: Wrap showErrorDialog's return value

As a result, showErrorDialog no longer returns a Future that can be
mistakenly awaited.  The wrapped return value offers clarity on how the
Future is supposed to be used.

There is no user visible change because existing callers (other than
lightbox's) that wait for its return value are all asynchronous
handlers for UI elements like buttons, and waits unnecessarily.
