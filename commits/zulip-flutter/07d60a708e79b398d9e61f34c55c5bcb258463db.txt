compose [nfc]: Refactor outer vertical padding on label in _Banner

Move vertical padding so it won't wrap the trailing element, when
present (as a `buildTrailing` that returns non-null). When we add
the "Cancel" and "Save" buttons for the edit-message banner, those
will want to control their own outer vertical padding to make it
respond to taps, because the painted button is supposed to be just
28px tall, which is too small for a touch target; see discussion
linked in dartdoc.

NFC because `buildTrailing` on _Banner's only subclass,
_ErrorBanner, returns null.
