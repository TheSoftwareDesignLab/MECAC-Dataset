msglist: Set content font color to match web

With Chrome's web inspector and Mac's "Digital Color Meter", I
verified that our color now matches web's color.

Since GlobalTime's clock icon is a text-like element, change it to
the new color too, and add a content test that makes sure the colors
match each other, and match the DefaultTextStyle that content
elements expect to inherit from.

I didn't find any other text-like elements that need extra treatment
like this.
