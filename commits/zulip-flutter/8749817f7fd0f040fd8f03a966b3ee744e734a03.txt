msglist: Friendlier placeholder text when narrow has no messages

Fixes #1555.

For now, the text simply says "There are no messages here." We'll
add per-narrow logic later, but this is an improvement over the
current appearance which just says "No earlier messages." (Earlier
than what?)

To support being used in the message-list page (in addition to
Inbox, etc.), the placeholder widget only needs small changes, it
turns out.
