widgets/content: Add MessageInheritedWidget to provide message simply

A lot of different widgets, some pretty deeply nested, go into
rendering a message's content. This way each of those widgets can
get data from the relevant Message object as needed, without the
need for passing it all the way down, from widget params to widget
params.
