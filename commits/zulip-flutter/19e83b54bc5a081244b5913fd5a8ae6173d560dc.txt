content test: Use mergedStyleOf for mentions, too

This change isn't quite NFC: textStyleFromWidget will now match even
if the Text widget has additional text in it beyond the targeted span.
That seems fine, though: it's not likely to happen; and if for some
reason it does, that's not really what this test is about.
