scroll: Avoid overscroll in "scroll to end"

As long as the bottom sliver is size zero (or more generally, as long
as maxScrollExtent does not change during the animation), this is
nearly NFC: I believe the only changes in behavior would come from
differences in rounding.

This change handles the case where the end turns out to be closer
than it looked at the beginning of the animation.  Before this
change, the animation would try to scroll past the end in that case.
Now it stops at exactly the end -- just like it already did in the
case where the end was known exactly in advance, as it currently
always is in the actual message list.

That case is a possibility as soon as there's a bottom sliver with a
message in it: scroll up so the message is offscreen and no longer
built; then have the message edited so it becomes shorter; then scroll
back down.  It's impossible for the viewport to know that the bottom
sliver's content has gotten taller until we actually scroll back down
and cause the message's widget to get built.

In order to customize this behavior, this change uses a feature I
added recently (for this purpose) to DrivenScrollActivity upstream:
