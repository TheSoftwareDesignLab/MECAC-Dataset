compose_box [nfc]: Reorder two calls in edit-message "Save" tap handler

Making sure to capture some data that store.editMessage needs from
the controller before that data is destroyed, in
composeBoxState.endEditInteraction, which disposes the controller.

Motivation: soon we'd like `store.editMessage` to return a Future,
which we'd like to await and add some error feedback, just like we
have in the send-message UX.
