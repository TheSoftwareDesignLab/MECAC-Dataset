emoji_reaction: Pass `explicitChildNodes: true` in a Semantics container

This fixes a test failure when we make an upcoming refactor. (The
container node's label would apparently have its children's labels
appended to it...I haven't seen that behavior in manual testing on
my iPhone with VoiceOver, before or after that refactor, but, shrug;
this change does seem correct anyway.)
