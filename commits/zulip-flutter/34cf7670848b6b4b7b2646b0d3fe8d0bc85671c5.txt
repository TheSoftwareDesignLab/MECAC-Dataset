dialog: Start-align dialog content on iOS, instead of center-align

We're about to show a stack trace in an error dialog, and it'll be
easier to read when start-aligned than center-aligned.

Applying it here with DefaultTextStyle, rather than on each Text
widget, to avoid repetition, particularly because one caller (of
_adaptiveContent) passes multiple Text widgets and we'd have to
handle each of those; that's in UpgradeWelcomeDialog.
