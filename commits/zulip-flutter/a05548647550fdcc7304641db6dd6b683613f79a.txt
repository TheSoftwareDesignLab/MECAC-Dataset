msglist: Ensure sole ownership of MessageListView

`PerAccountStore` shouldn't be an owner of the `MessageListView`
objects.

Its relationship to `MessageListView` is similar to that of
`AutocompleteViewManager` to `MentionAutocompleteView` (#645).

With two owners, `MessageListView` can be disposed twice when
`removeAccount` is called (when the user logs out, for example):

1. Before the frame is rendered, after removing the `PerAccountStore`
   from `GlobalStore`, `removeAccount` disposes the `PerAccountStore` ,
   which disposes the `MessageListView` (via `MessageStoreImpl`).

   `removeAccount` also notifies the listeners of `GlobalStore`.

   At this point `_MessageListState` is not yet disposed.

2. Being dependent on `GlobalStore`, `PerAccountStoreWidget` is rebuilt.
   This time, the StatefulElement corresponding to the `MessageList`
   widget, is no longer in the element tree because `PerAccountStoreWidget`
   cannot find the account and builds a placeholder instead.

3. During finalization, `_MessageListState` tries to dispose the
   `MessageListView`, and fails to do so.

We couldn't've kept `MessageStoreImpl.dispose` with an assertion
`_messageListView.isEmpty`, because `PerAccountStore` is disposed before
`_MessageListState.dispose` (and similarily
`_MessageListState.onNewStore`) is called.  Fixing that will be a future
follow-up to this, as noted in the TODO comment.
