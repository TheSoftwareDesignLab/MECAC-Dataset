msglist: Handle bold-text setting in code blocks and error-unimplementeds

Code blocks and _errorUnimplemented were setting their own
weightVariableTextStyle without passing a BuildContext, which meant
the styles didn't condition on the device setting.

But weightVariableTextStyle is already applied, in a
DefaultTextStyle that wraps the whole message list. (That's because
that DefaultTextStyle wants to set a font, kDefaultFontFamily,
that's also variable-weight.) So the clobbering ones aren't
necessary; remove them.

Fixes: #690
