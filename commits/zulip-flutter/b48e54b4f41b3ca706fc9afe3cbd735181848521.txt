autocomplete [nfc]: Simplify and clarify docs on comparator methods

The details of negative vs. positive vs. zero return values are part
of the interface of comparators in general.  The details of 1 vs. any
other positive value, or -1 vs. any other negative value, are
implementation details of the methods -- callers should only care
about negative vs. positive vs. zero.
