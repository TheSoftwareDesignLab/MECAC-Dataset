content: Remove TextBaseline.alphabetic from plain-paragraph style

I'm not sure if this actually improves how we show non-alphabetic
text in any cases at all (so I'm not sure if it's NFC), but anyway,
hard-coding this attribute here or anywhere has a smell of being
counterproductive for i18n; remove it.
