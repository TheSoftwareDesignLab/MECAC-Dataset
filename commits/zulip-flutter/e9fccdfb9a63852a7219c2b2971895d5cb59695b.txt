login [nfc]: Pull username-password form into separate widget

To make room for web-auth buttons on the same page.

For now, we'll plan to put the username/password form and all the
web-auth buttons together on the same page. We don't have to keep it
this way forever, but it has some advantages:
- My feeling is that most web apps do this, and I don't see an
  obvious reason to deviate from that pattern here, probably
  because:
- In the common case of username/password authentication, users
  won't need to tap a "Sign in with password" button and then
  context-switch to a new page. The form is just there, right after
  your realm URL has been accepted.
