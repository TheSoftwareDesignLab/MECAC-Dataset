scroll: Keep short list pinned at bottom of viewport, not past bottom

This is NFC as to the real message list, because so far the bottom
sliver there always has height 0.

Before this change, the user could always scroll up (moving the
content down) so that the bottom sliver was entirely off the bottom
of the viewport, even if that exposed blank space at the top of the
viewport because the top sliver was shorter than the viewport.
After this change, it's never in bounds to have part of the viewport
be blank for lack of content while there's content scrolled out of
the viewport at the other end.

This is a step toward letting us move part of the message list into
the bottom sliver, because it fixes a bug that would otherwise create
in the case where the top sliver fits entirely on the screen.
