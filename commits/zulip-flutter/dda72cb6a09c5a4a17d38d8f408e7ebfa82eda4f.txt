content test: Remove test that's redundant with testContentSmoke test

In the 'inline math' group just above this, we have the following test:

  testContentSmoke(ContentExample.mathInline);

Looks like the behavior of that test differs from this one, just in
not passing `findRichText: true`. But that didn't stop it from
finding the expected text and passing, so, shrug.
