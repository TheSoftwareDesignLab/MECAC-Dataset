test: Add integration test of _UnreadMarker animation

Added an initial integration test to capture render
performance of _UnreadMarker animation. This method was
helpful for comparing across different implementations
of the marker to see if any method was more efficient
than others.

The test driver `integration_test/perf_driver.dart` is
derived from BSD licensed example code in Flutter
documentation about integration tests profiling, see:
  https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/profiling#3-save-the-results-to-disk

Also added a `docs/integration_tests.md` to capture
notes on the process of gathering performance metrics
on physical devices.
