We don't currently write any Kotlin code, so on a quick skim
I don't see anything there that would affect us.

This does, though, resolve a number of warnings that `flutter run`
has been emitting recently when building for Android, each of them
with this message (wrapped for readability):

  Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin.
  The binary version of its metadata is 1.8.0, expected version is 1.6.0.

For example, two of the 14 warnings were:
