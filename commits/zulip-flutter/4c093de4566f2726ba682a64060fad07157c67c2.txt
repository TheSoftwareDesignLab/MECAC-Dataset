compose: Show a Refresh/Subscribe banner when unsubscribed and can't send

This fixes part of the "second buggy behavior" that I described
in #1789: specifically, it fixes that behavior when the self-user
doesn't have permission to send messages in the channel.

Later, for the case where there *is* permission to send messages, we
should use a different banner label, like "Replies to your messages
will not appear automatically." I think it's smoothest not to touch
that case until we've fixed the "first" and "third" parts of #1798,
because those are bugs in the send-message experience.
