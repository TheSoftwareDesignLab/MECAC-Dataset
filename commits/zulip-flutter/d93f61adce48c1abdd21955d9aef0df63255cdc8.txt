muted-users: Say "Muted user" to replace a user's name, where applicable

(Done by adding an is-muted condition in store.userDisplayName and
store.senderDisplayName, with an opt-out param.)

If Chris is muted, we'll now show "Muted user" where before we would
show "Chris Bobbe", in the following places:

- Message-list page:
  - DM-narrow app bar.
  - DM recipient headers.
  - The sender row on messages. This and message content will get
    more treatment in a separate commit.
  - Emoji-reaction chips on messages.
  - Typing indicators ("Muted user is typing…"), but we'll be
    excluding muted users, coming up in a separate commit.
  - Voter names in poll messages.
- DM items in the Inbox page. (Messages from muted users are
  automatically marked as read, but they can end up in the inbox if
  you un-mark them as read.)
- The new-DM sheet, but we'll be excluding muted users, coming up in
  a separate commit.
- @-mention autocomplete, but we'll be excluding muted users, coming
  up in a separate commit.
- Items in the Direct messages ("recent DMs") page. We'll be
  excluding DMs where everyone is muted, coming up in a separate
  commit.
- User items in custom profile fields.

We *don't* do this replacement in the following places, i.e., we'll
still show "Chris Bobbe" if Chris is muted:

- Sender name in the header of the lightbox page. (This follows
  web.)
- The "hint text" for the compose box in a DM narrow: it will still
  say "Message @Chris Bobbe", not "Message @Muted user". (This
  follows web.)
- The user's name at the top of the Profile page.
- We won't generate malformed @-mention syntax like
  @_**Muted user|13313**.
