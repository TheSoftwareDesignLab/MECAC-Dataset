compose: Show error dialog on failure of edit-message request

I'm not finding the discussion where we said we wanted this (for
consistency with the send-message UX), but I think we did.

Error-feedback logic copied from the tap-"Send" button
(_SendButtonState._send) modulo the error dialog's title, "Message
not saved" vs. "Message not sent".
