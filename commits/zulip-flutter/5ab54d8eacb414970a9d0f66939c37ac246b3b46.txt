scroll: Add CustomPaintOrderScrollView

This lets us control the paint order between the slivers, so that
the top sliver is able to overflow over the bottom sliver when a
sticky header calls for that.

I've sent a PR upstream to add the same feature to CustomScrollView
itself:
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/164818

That PR has been delayed by infra issues in Google testing, though.
So doing this in our tree lets us move ahead without waiting.

(I actually wrote this version first, then adapted it to produce the
upstream PR.  So landing this version isn't significant extra work.)
