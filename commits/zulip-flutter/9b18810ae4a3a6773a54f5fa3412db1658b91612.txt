action_sheet [nfc]: Avoid passing footgun context to onPressed methods

The usual Flutter idiom, which we use across the rest of the app,
would call for using the parameter called `context` wherever a
BuildContext is required: for getting the store or localizations,
or passing to a method like showErrorDialog, and so on.

That idiom doesn't work here, because that context belongs to the
action sheet itself, which gets dismissed at the start of the method.
Worse, it will sometimes seem to work, nondeterministically: the
context only gets unmounted after the animation to dismiss the action
sheet is complete, which takes something like 200ms.  So the
temptation to use it has been a recurring source of small bugs.

Fix the problem by not passing the action sheet's context to these
methods at all.
