theme: Replace `colorMessageHeaderIconInteractive` with `title`

The `colorMessageHeaderIconInteractive` giving color to follow/mute
icons beside topic names have been replaced to a lighter and darker
versions in dark and light themes respectively, using the `title`
variable of `DesignVariables`.

This specific UI doesn't appear in the Figma design, but we use `title`
because it's used there for the color of a dropdown icon that also
appears next to topics.
