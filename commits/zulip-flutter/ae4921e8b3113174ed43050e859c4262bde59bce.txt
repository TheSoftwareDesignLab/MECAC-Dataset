compose [nfc]: Rename and document a helper

_ComposeBoxContainer also supports an error banner that doesn't
replace the text inputs. We don't use that feature yet (the Figma
has some examples where it'll be helpful:
  https://www.figma.com/design/1JTNtYo9memgW7vV6d0ygq/Zulip-Mobile?node-id=4031-16992&m=dev
and we used it in a draft toward #720 that wasn't merged:
  https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/issues/720#issuecomment-2529905664
) but it seems helpful anyway to nail down this helper like this.
