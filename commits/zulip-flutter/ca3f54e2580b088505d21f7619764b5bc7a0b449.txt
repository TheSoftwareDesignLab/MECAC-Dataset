action_sheet [nfc]: Make BottomSheetHeaderPlainText more flexible; rename

Before, this widget supported just one plain-styled multiline UI
string:

In addition to that feature, it now also supports:

- Richer text for that string, such as TextWithLink, which we'll use
  for read-receipts:
    https://www.figma.com/design/1JTNtYo9memgW7vV6d0ygq/Zulip-Mobile?node-id=11367-20898&m=dev
- A "title" line above that string, which is bigger and bolder;
  we'll also use that for read-receipts.
- The header may appear with
  - a title and subtitle (as in the normal read-receipts case), or
  - just a title (as in read-receipts when loading or when nobody
    has read the message), or
  - just a message, as in the current caller in the view-reactions
    sheet
- (The title may be richly styled too; we can use this when showing
  the channel name in the channel action sheet header, #1533, which
  calls for showing the channel privacy icon.)
