text [nfc]: Don't force any callers to specify wghtIfPlatformRequestsBold

In particular, remove this assert:

  assert((wght != null) == (wghtIfPlatformRequestsBold != null));

and default the effective `wghtIfPlatformRequestsBold`, when absent,
to a consistent formula that gives the same result for all the
callers so far. (Including callers that haven't been passing either
`wght` or `wghtIfPlatformRequestsBold`: those have been getting
[FontWeight.normal.value] / [FontWeight.bold.value], which is 400 /
700; and our new helper gives 700 for 400.)
