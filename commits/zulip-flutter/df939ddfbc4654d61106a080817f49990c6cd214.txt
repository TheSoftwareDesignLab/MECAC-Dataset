deps: Bump json_annotation lower bound to latest, 4.8.1

Otherwise we get the following warning when running build_runner
(wrapped here for readability):

    [WARNING] json_serializable on lib/api/route/users.dart:
    The version constraint "^4.8.0" on json_annotation
    allows versions before 4.8.1 which is not allowed.

I believe that warning was introduced with the json_serializable
upgrade from 6.6.2 to 6.7.0 in f28dd0bfc / #137.
