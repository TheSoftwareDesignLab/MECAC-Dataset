button [nfc]: Have ZulipWebUiKitButton support an icon

For muted-users, coming up.

This is consistent with the ad hoc design for muted-users, but also
consistent with the component in "Zulip Web UI Kit". (Modulo the
TODO for changing icon-to-label gap from 8px to 6px; that's tricky
with the Material widget we're working with.)
