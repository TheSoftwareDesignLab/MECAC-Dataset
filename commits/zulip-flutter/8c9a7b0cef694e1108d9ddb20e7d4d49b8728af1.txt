content test [nfc]: Drop skipped duplicate KaTeX font-size ratio test

This skipped test is a duplicate of the one above it, but
incorrectly has the description of the one below it. Probably a
result of conflict-resolution error in b073c6b26 which introduced
this duplicate, or another in the chain of cherry-picks that led to
that commit.
