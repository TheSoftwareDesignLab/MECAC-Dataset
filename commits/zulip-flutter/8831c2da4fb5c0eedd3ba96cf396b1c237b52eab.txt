msglist test: Make double-fetch-glitch test robust to layout changes

Since adding this test, we've repeatedly seen it break upon
changes that affect how tall the messages are:

In particular, the length of this pump for the fling-scroll has
needed adjustments.  Automate that by just finding out empirically
how far is far enough to trigger the fetch, and proceeding from there.
