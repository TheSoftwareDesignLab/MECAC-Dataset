ui: Set letter spacing to 1% in buttons

TextTheme.labelLarge is the default label style in all the various
Material buttons; see:

  [ElevatedButton.defaultStyleOf], [FilledButton.defaultStyleOf],
  [MenuItemButton.defaultStyleOf], [MenuItemButton.defaultStyleOf],
  [OutlinedButton.defaultStyleOf], `defaults` in [SegmentedButton.build],
  [TextButton.defaultStyleOf]

. Since our buttons are all Material buttons, changing this will
effectively "set letter spacing to 1% in buttons", which is #548.

(...Actually, I guess there's one kind of button that's not a
Material button: reaction chips in the message list. So, adjust
those separately, also in this commit.)

Greg mentioned, when suggesting this approach,

> In principle that has a slightly broader effect than specified in

Which makes sense and works for me.

Fixes: #548
