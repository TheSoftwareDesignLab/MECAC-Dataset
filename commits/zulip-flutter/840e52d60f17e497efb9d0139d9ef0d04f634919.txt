inbox: Fix bug where channel unread badge text color was slightly wrong

UnreadCountBadge has a needlessly loose API for specifying a
background color, with three options:

1. Channel-colorized: callers are supposed to pass a
   ChannelColorSwatch and the implementation picks
   `unreadCountBadgeBackground` off of that.
2. Any other Color. (ChannelColorSwatch is a Color.)
3. A default color, chosen by the implementation, if `null` is
   passed.

We don't actually have any use for option 2, at least currently, so
we'll remove it next.

The buggy caller here was using option 2 when it should have used
option 1: it wanted a channel-colored background, but it itself
picked `unreadCountBadgeBackground` off of the swatch instead of
passing the whole swatch to UnreadCountBadge for it to do that. That
would have been fine except that the channel-colorized case has its
own associated *text* color, and that's conditioned on whether the
passed background color is a ChannelColorSwatch.
