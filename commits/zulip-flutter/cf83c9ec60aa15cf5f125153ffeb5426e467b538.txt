channel: Add selfHasContentAccess, using canSubscribeGroup et al

Fixes #814.
Fixes part of #1786.

The general implementation of group-based permissions (#814)
was added in the commits leading up to this one.  This commit
demonstrates implementing a given such permission.

Then we also use the new permission in one place where we already
want to use it, toward #1786.  (There's another part of #1786 which
calls for a variation: determining whether the user would be able
to re-subscribe to a channel if they unsubscribe.  We'll leave that
for a follow-up.)  We'll also be adding a more prominent bit of UI
that wants this permission soon: the list of channels, #188.

To exercise this method on real data, I added some debugging prints
that printed a list of the channels where this returned true, and a
list of the channels where it returned false.  I also manually tested
the change for #1786, by visiting an unsubscribed private channel
(via the link in a #-mention), long-pressing the app bar to get the
channel action sheet, and then (as another user, on web) adding and
removing permission for the test user to subscribe themself.
