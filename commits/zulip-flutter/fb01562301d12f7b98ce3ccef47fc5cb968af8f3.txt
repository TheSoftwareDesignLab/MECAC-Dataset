content [nfc]: Add ContentTheme.colorGlobalTimeBorder

The dark and light values come from the web app.

This completes the sweep through message-content colors for #95 dark
theme. They are all either in ContentTheme with light/dark variants,
or still inline but with a comment explaining that they don't need
light/dark variants.
