nav [nfc]: Use MaterialAccountWidgetRoute more comprehensively

Now PerAccountStoreWidget has just two constructor call sites
in the app.  There's one for the flight shuttle in LightboxHero,
a rare example of a widget not belonging to any page; and then
the one in AccountPageRouteMixin covers every page in the app
that needs a per-account store.
