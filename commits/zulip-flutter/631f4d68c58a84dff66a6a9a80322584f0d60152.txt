api: Add getMessageCompat helper, for servers with and without FL 120

We can use this to get raw Markdown content for quote-and-reply
(#116) and for the "Share" option on a message. For those, we only
care about the raw Markdown content and so could just as well have
used the `raw_content` field on the get-single-message response, for
servers pre-120. But...

We can also use this for #73, "Handle Zulip-internal links by
navigation", to follow /near/<id> links through topic/stream moves
(see implementation in zulip-mobile). For that, we'll need more than
just the message's raw Markdown.
