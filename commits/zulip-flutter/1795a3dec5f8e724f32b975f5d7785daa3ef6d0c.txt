content: Consolidate plain-paragraph style in `baseContentTextStyle`

For non-paragraph content that wants to inherit its font size and
line height attributes, it seems at least as natural to inherit them
from our plain paragraph style, as from...hmm...
TextTheme.bodyMedium, as is happening currently. Doing so should
make the content styles more self-contained and decrease the need
for nonlocal reasoning when reading the code.

These are the elements that inherit both their font-size and
line-height attributes:
- line breaks (i.e., <br> in a block context; `LineBreakNode`)
- list-item markers (e.g., "1." in a numbered list)

Instead of font-size 14 and line-height 1.43x, from
TextTheme.bodyMedium, those now have font-size 17 and line-height
~1.29x (i.e., 22 / 17). Since the list-item markers change is
somewhat conspicuous, I filed #697 ("content: Markers on list items
are smaller than list-item text"), which this commit fixes.

Code blocks (and our simplified math blocks) set their own font
size, but they do inherit their line height. So those now also have
a line height of ~1.29x instead of 1.43x. As it happens, web sets a
line height of 1.4x for code blocks, which we should probably follow
(intentionally). I'll make that adjustment next, but now hopefully
this is a helpful structure for our content implementations.

Fixes: #697
