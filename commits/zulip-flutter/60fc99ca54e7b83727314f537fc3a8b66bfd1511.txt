Say "DM"/"direct message" instead of "PM"/"private message", in UI and code

There was only one occurrence in the UI, in [DmRecipientHeader].

The remaining few places we refer to the old names are in the
context of the server API.  We have issue #146 open to start using
the new names there where possible.

Fixes: #145
