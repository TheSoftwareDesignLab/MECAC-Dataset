compose [nfc]: s/_ComposeBoxLayout/_ComposeBoxBody/

This widget is already doing more than layout (sizing and
positioning its inputs on the screen): it creates the attachment
buttons and styles their touch feedback, and it defeats an unwanted
border that its `topicInput` and `contentInput` params might
otherwise create.

I chose the name "body" to distinguish this from some other elements
that will need to share the compose-box surface, for the UI part of
issue #720: an error banner and a linear progress indicator.

Then also add "body" to the names _StreamComposeBox and
_FixedDestinationComposeBox. Since the recent commits that
simplified those, they're really just thin, stateless wrappers that
configure a _ComposeBoxBody.
