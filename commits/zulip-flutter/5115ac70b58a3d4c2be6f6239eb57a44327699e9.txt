content: Remove TextStyle merge in rendering bold spans

Fixes #1817.

Similar reasoning as in the previous commit; see there. The bold
span-node was clobbering the strikethrough attribute when that is
set by an ancestor strikethrough node.

(This is bolderWghtTextStyle's only caller, so it's simple to change
its interface this way.)
