code_block: Fix null-check `!` errors during hot reloads

On hot-reload, `lerp` is triggered even when the theme has not
changed. Discussion:

I considered just going ahead with placing the web app's current
light-theme styles for code blocks (#754), but pretty soon I
realized there would still be some nulls in there after doing so,
and those would need to be treated like we're treating the nulls
here.
