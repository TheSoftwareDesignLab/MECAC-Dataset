recent dms [nfc]: Handle bottom insets explicitly in recent DMs page

This reverts part of 742320ce7 for RecentDmConversationsPageBody,
and also handles bottom insets for the new DMs button.

As this widget is planned to be used outside the context of home
page, specifically for the upcoming share page.
