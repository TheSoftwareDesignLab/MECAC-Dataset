theme [nfc]: Replace `dateSeparator` with `foreground`

The variable giving color to divider lines in the Message List UI
i.e. `dateSeparator` has been replaced with the `foreground` variable
of `DesignVariables`, according to the Figma design.
There isn't any change in the values of color from the previous one i.e.
`dateSeparator`.
