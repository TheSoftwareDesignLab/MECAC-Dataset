read_receipts: Improve UX by making the sheet draggable-scrollable

The Figma asks that the sheet be expandable to fill the screen:
  https://www.figma.com/design/1JTNtYo9memgW7vV6d0ygq/Zulip-Mobile?node-id=11367-21131&m=dev
and that's implemented here.

Compare f8ddff2f3, where we removed an earlier implementation. I
hadn't tried to bring that back yet because I wanted to support
triggering resize from a drag handle at the top, and I couldn't
figure out how to do that. IIRC I could only get the drag handle to
respond to drag-down gestures (via `enableDrag: true`) by shifting
the sheet's position downward. That worked as a way to dismiss the
sheet, but it was frustratingly different from the gesture handling
on the scrollable list:
- The slide-to-dismiss looked different from the shrink-and-dismiss,
  an awkward inconsistency
- The list would respond to upward drags, too (by growing and
  showing more content)
I've managed it here, modulo with a header instead of a drag handle,
by making sure the scrollable area extends through the top of the
sheet. (Done with a CustomScrollView, pinning the header to the
viewport top.)
