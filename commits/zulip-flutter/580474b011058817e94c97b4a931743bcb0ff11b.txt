test [nfc]: Make globalSettings optional on TestGlobalStore

This has a natural default, at least in tests, because most tests
don't care about the specific value of the global settings.

(By contrast most tests that interact with the store at all will
care what set of accounts exist, so there isn't as natural a default
for `accounts`.)
