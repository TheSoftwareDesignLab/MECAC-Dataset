deps: Upgrade Flutter to latest main, 3.18.0-7.0.pre.55

And update Flutter's supporting libraries to match.

Also remove now-unnecessary imports of `dart:ui`. Upstream Flutter
(in flutter/flutter@c6741614041 ) changed `flutter/painting.dart`
and others to additionally export several more types from
`dart:ui`. This caused a lot of our imports to trigger an
analysis warning of `unnecessary_import`.
