settings: Add easy settings page using (adaptive) Material widgets

This will use generic Material-style controls on Android, and
generic iOS-style controls on iOS.

This does not aim to fully implement the draft design for the settings
page.  We offer it mainly to test settings, so the implementation is
kept as simple as possible.

Draft design for reference:
