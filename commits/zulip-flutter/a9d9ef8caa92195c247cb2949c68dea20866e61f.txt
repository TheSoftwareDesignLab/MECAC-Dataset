ui: Extract ZulipAppBar for loading indicator.

Ideally we may have test to exhaustively ensure that all pages
specific to a single PerAccountStore use ZulipAppBar.

Some pages with `AppBar`s are skipped, such as AboutZulip (no
PerAccountStore access) and lightboxes (progress indicator is occupied
for other purposes, and the AppBar can be hidden).

Fixes #465.
