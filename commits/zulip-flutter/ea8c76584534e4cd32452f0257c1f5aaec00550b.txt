deps: Upgrade video_player_android to 2.7.3

Changelog:
  https://pub.dev/packages/video_player_android/changelog

This update migrates the plugin to use newer API recommended
to support Impeller:

Without this migration, the videos do play but they look
pixelated, resulting in a bad UX.

Additionally updates the underlying Media3-ExoPlayer
library to version 1.4.1:
