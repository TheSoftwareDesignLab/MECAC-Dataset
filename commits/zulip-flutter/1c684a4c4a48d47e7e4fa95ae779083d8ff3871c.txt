home: Stop assuming account existence from loading page

We could pass realmUrl when initializing the `_LoadingPlaceholderPage`,
but that will still require a check for the existence of the account.

The loading page will be blank when the account does not exist. The user
can't easily reach this page because they can only logout from
`ChooseAccountPage`, until we start invalidating API keys. Even then,
they will only see the blank page briefly before getting navigated, so
we should not show any text at all.

Fixes: #1219
