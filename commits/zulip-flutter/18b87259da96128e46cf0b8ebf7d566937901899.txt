theme: Replace `dateSeparatorText` & `messageTimestamp` with `labelTime`

The `dateSeparatorText` and `messageTimestamp`, which define the color
of the date and time stamps on messages and message headers, have been
replaced with a lower-contrast version in both dark and light themes.
This is done using a new `labelTime` variable in `MessageListTheme`,
aligning with the Figma Design.
