notif: Use associated account as initial account, if opened from background

Previously, when two accounts (Account-1 and Account-2) were
logged in, the app always defaulted to showing the home page
of Account-1 on launch. If the app was closed and the user
opened a notification from Account-2, the navigation stack
would be:
  HomePage(Account-1) -> MessageListPage(Account-2)

This commit fixes that behaviour, now when a notification is
opened while the app is closed, the home page will correspond
to the account associated with the notification's conversation.

This addresses #1210 for background notifications.
