theme: Replace `streamMessageBgDefault` with `bgMessageRegular`

The `streamMessageBgDefault` giving colors to the background of both
Stream messages and DMs UI, has been changed to a darker version for the
dark theme, using a new `bgMessageRegular` variable in the
`MessageListTheme`, according to the Figma design. It's just a refactor
of variable for the light theme.
