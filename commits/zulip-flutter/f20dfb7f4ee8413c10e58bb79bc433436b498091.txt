scroll: Stay at end once there

This is NFC as to the real message list, because so far the bottom
sliver there always has height 0, so that both maxScrollExtent and
this.maxScrollExtent are always 0.

This is a step toward letting us move part of the message list into
the bottom sliver, because it means that doing so would preserve the
list's current behavior of remaining scrolled to the end once there
as e.g. new messages arrive.
