logo: Switch from Inkscape to rsvg-convert / librsvg

This SVG implementation is more convenient than Inkscape's for
several reasons:

 * It's faster -- the runtime for the whole script goes from about
   5.5s down to 1.5s.

 * It doesn't include a redundant alpha layer (of a constant 0xff)
   in the output.  That makes all the PNG outputs smaller, and
   better yet lets us cut out the mess of ImageMagick `convert`
   we'd been using for stripping that layer in the one file where
   Apple forbids it.

 * Most concretely: it supports the `transform` CSS property.
   That will come in very handy in the next commit, to help us
   stitch together different pieces of the new icon design.

   For a useful table of which SVG implementations support which
   features, see this page from resvg:
     https://linebender.org/resvg-test-suite/svg-support-table.html
   (At the moment resvg isn't in Debian stable, though -- presumably
   because Rust packaging is somewhat hard -- so resvg itself was
   less convenient for me to use.)

Just like with the last couple of commits, this produces a visually
imperceptible change in the output files.  Examining with `sng`
shows some pixels did change slightly, and also that some metadata
got simpler.  Here's from Icon-20x20@2x.png:

     IHDR {
         width: 40; height: 40; bitdepth: 8;
    -    using color alpha;
    -}
    -pHYs {xpixels: 6299; ypixels: 6299; per: meter;}  # (160 dpi)
    -tEXt {
    -    keyword: "Software";
    -    text: "www.inkscape.org";
    +    using color;
     }
    +bKGD {red: 255;  green: 255;  blue: 255;}

Others are similar but with width, height, xpixels, ypixels, and
the DPI figure all scaled up; and in Icon-1024x1024@1x.png the old
version had no "alpha" but did have sections cHRM and gAMA.

Like with a couple of previous commits in this series, we leave
those changes out for now, in order to bundle them with
substantive changes coming next.
