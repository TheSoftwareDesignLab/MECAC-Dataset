api: Don't allow connecting to servers <4.0

From the README:

https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter?tab=readme-ov-file#server-compatibility
> We support Zulip Server 4.0 and later.

This implementation isn't ideal because it logs you out, instead of
just taking down the account's UI as we discussed:

But it was simpler this way since programmatically logging out is
already an action we handle.

Fixes: #267
