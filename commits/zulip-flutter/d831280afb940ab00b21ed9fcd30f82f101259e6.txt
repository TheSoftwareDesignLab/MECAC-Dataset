msglist [nfc]: Say we'll show "loading" even when fetch is at other end

This is NFC ultimately because we currently only ever fetch, or
show loading indicators, at one end of the message list, namely
the start.

When we do start supporting a message list in the middle of history,
though (#82), and consequently loading newer as well as older
messages, my conclusion after thinking it through is that we'll want
a "busy fetching" state at one end to mean we show a loading
indicator at the other end too, if it still has more to be fetched.

This would look weird if the user actually saw both at the same time
-- but that shouldn't happen, because if both ends (or even either
end) is still open then the original fetch should have found plenty of
messages to separate them, many screenfuls' worth.

And conversely, if the user does kick off a fetch at one end and then
scroll swiftly to the other end and witness how that appears, we want
to show them a "loading" sign.  The situation is exactly like if
they'd had a fetch attempt on that same end and we were backing off
from failure: there's no fetch right now, but even though a fetch is
needed (because the user is looking at the incomplete end of the
known history), the app will hold off from starting one right now.
Declining to start a fetch when one is needed means effectively that
the loading is busy.
