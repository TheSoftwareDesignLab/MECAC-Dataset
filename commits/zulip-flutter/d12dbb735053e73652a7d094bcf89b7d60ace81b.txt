msglist [nfc]: Remove a TODO for finding some dark-theme colors

For the background color, the unread-marker color seems like a very
reasonable starting point, since that's what we're using in light
theme.

White seems reasonable for dark theme, just like in light theme.
There shouldn't be an issue with contrast; I expect the background
will be darker, if anything, in dark theme.

We can always refine these styles later.
