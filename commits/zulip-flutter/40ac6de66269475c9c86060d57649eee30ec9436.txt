sticky_header [nfc]: Cut redundant assert on header size

It's already a fact that the header's size in each dimension is
non-negative and finite; the framework asserts that in the `layout`
implementation (via debugAssertDoesMeetConstraints).

So that includes `headerExtent`; and then `paintedHeaderSize` is
bounded to between zero and that value.
