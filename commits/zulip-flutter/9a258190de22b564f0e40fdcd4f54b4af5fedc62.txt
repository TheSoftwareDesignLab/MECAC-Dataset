content test [nfc]: Use prepareContentBare, not ad hoc tester.pumpWidget

It should now be easy to drop in natural dependencies of our content
widgets, such as a ThemeExtension for custom light- and dark-theme
colors, for all the tests of our Zulip content widgets. To do that,
we can just add unconditional code to this function.

After this change, some ad-hoc `tester.pumpWidget` calls do remain
in this file; see tests of RealmContentNetworkImage and AvatarImage.
But those aren't "Zulip content widgets" in the same sense as most
of the widgets in lib/widgets/content.dart, which are used
exclusively to render parsed Zulip Markdown. (There isn't even any
Zulip Markdown that would produce an AvatarImage.) So, leave them
be. Perhaps these widgets belong in some other file.
