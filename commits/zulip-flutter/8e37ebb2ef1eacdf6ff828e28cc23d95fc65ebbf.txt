ui: Prevent app-bar color change on scrolled-under state, again

We successfully prevented this color change in 82eb41ee6, but an
upstream Flutter change reintroduced a color change. Specifically,
flutter/flutter@a2c7ed95d introduced ColorScheme.surfaceContainer
and started using it for the scrolled-under state, in the case where
the app bar hasn't been given a backgroundColor directly or by
theme.
