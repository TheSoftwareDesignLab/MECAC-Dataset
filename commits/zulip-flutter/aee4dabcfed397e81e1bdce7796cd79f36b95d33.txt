model: Cache stream-color swatch on Subscription object

As mentioned in a TODO, I'm not sure it makes sense to deal with
package:flutter/painting.dart from within our lib/api/model/ code.
We might end up factoring that out somewhere else.

Next, we'll have our UnreadCountBadge widget optionally consume one
of these swatches.
