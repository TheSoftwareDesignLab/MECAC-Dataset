deps: Update Flutter to latest 3.21.0-12.0.pre.26, and intl to match

Recent Flutter versions from main pin a newer version of package:intl,
making them incompatible with our current pubspec constraints
and causing CI to fail (#575).  So we need to upgrade `intl`.

That in turn would break things on older Flutter, so we bump the
minimum Flutter version at the same time.  This also conveniently
ensures that we have flutter/flutter@01fc13d9f, a nice upstream
improvement from our contributor VatsalBhesaniya.

The Flutter bump comes with a small tweak to respond to an
API deprecation.

The `intl` changelog identifies no potentially breaking changes:

Fixes: #575
