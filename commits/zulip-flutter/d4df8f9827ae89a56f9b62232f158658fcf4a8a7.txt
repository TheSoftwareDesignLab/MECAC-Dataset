set-status: Remove the status-suggestion items touch feedback

As Chris mentioned in #1769 description:
  "Remove the InkWell touch feedback on status-suggestion items.
   I usually like touch feedback, but the Figma doesn't specify it here,
   and it's not clear if we'd want it to extend through the device
   insets or not. Thankfully there's no network request so it should
   always be immediately clear that a tap was detected (the inputs
   will change)."
