msglist: Move white background color to MessageItem, from whole list

This lets `colorScheme.background` (which we matched to the Figma in
21dbae120) come through in the area with the "Mark X messages as
read" button, following a Figma frame:
  https://www.figma.com/file/1JTNtYo9memgW7vV6d0ygq/Zulip-Mobile?node-id=147%3A9133&mode=dev
(There's a different Figma frame that shows a stream-specific color
there; more on that in the next commit.)

The background color (`colorScheme.background`) will now also come
through in these areas:

- in the area with the "No earlier messages" text, when scrolled to
  the earliest messages
- in the new blank space we added after the most recent message,
  earlier in this series of commits.

Fixes: #401
