check: Use --text when potentially diffing generated files

The diffs generated from running `tools/check build_runner` were not
detected.  See comment:
https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/pull/904#discussion_r1762083210

We normally exclude diffs from generated files through our
`.gitattributes` configurations.  This happens to `git --quiet --
[<path>...]` too.  -a/--text allows us to include those files
regardless.
