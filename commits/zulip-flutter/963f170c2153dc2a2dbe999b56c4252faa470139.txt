share: Support sharing content received from other apps on Android

Enables the app to receive arbitrary content from other apps via
advertising Android Intent filters in AndroidManifest. It allows
the OS to list our app in the platform share sheet.

Adds handlers for the two Intent actions, namely SEND and
SEND_MULTIPLE. Handling all three possible combinations:

  - Receiving only a text
  - Receiving only a file (or multiple files in case of SEND_MULTIPLE)
  - Receiving both the file (or multiple) and the accompanying
    text.

The Android side Kotlin implementation is adapted from the legacy
app's implementation, with only difference being that the legacy app
didn't handle the 3rd case mentioned above, see:

To allow sending Android Intent events from Kotlin to Dart,
Pigeon's EventChannelApi is used. For which the registration
happens in `MainActivity.configureFlutterEngine`, this bit of code
was adapted from Pigeon's Android example, see:
