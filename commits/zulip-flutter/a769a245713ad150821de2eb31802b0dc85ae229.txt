content: Fix **`bold code`** rendering with regular weight

Our experience with variable-weight fonts is that, whenever we use
such a font, we need to specify a "wght" value, even if we want the
text to appear in the boring, regular weight. If we don't specify a
"wght", the text will appear in an extremely light weight.

We use a variable-weight font (Source Code Pro) for rendering inline
code spans, so that's why we were using weightVariableTextStyle
here. As an unfortunate result, when a code span appears inside a
bold ("strong") span, the outer span's bold-weight style has been
getting clobbered, and the code span appears in regular weight.

Fortunately, removing the `weightVariableTextStyle` from the inline
code style doesn't actually cause any inline spans to appear at
minimum weight. This is a relief, and it follows from the presence
of a `weightVariableTextStyle` applied widely across the app; see
zulipTypography and 6784ef9ca. We apply it widely across the app
because we apply Source Sans 3 widely across the app, and that is
also a variable-weight font. Moreover, Source Code Pro and Source
Sans 3 seem closely related (and were designed by the same person),
so it's likely that their "wght" axes are identical.
