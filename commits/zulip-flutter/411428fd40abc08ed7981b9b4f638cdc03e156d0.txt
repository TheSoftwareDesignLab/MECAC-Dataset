text [nfc]: Edit slightly misleading comment on kMonospaceTextStyle

We don't actually use DefaultTextStyle to set a different
variable-weight font, and the old comment text might make a reader
go hunting for where we do that. (What we do is set
kDefaultFontFamily in zulipTypography, which feeds into
[TextTheme].)
