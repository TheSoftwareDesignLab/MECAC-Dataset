compose: Redesign error banner that replaces the compose box

This cherry-picks (with some adjustments) UI changes from Zixuan's
current revision of PR #924 (for issue #720):

  compose: Support error banner redesign for replacing the compose box

See the Figma:

The new design is meant to put the banner at the very top of the
compose-box surface, with no margin. So #1089, where the old
banner's top margin disappeared, looking buggy, is resolved.

The surface (but not content) of the redesigned banner seems like it
should extend through any left/right device insets to those edges of
the screen. By taking the banner as param separate from `body`,
_ComposeBoxContainer lets the banner do that -- without dropping its
responsibility for keeping the body (inputs, compose buttons, and
send button) out of the insets. The body doesn't need to consume the
insets itself and it's already complicated enough without needing
its own SafeAreas.

It also seems like the banner should pad the bottom inset when it's
meant to replace the body, so we do that and make the expectation
clear in the `errorBanner` dartdoc.
