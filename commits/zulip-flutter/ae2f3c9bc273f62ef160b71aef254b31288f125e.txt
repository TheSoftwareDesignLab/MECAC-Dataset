content: Stop accidentally dropping paragraph text style in user mentions

In c7be9c34d we specified some text style properties to follow web
(including using the Source Sans 3 font). That didn't get applied to
user mentions, so those were conspicuously different from
surrounding text. Fixed now.

Fixes: #430
