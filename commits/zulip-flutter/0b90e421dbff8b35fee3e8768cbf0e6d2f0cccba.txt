lightbox: Add user's avatar on the lightbox app bar

This change updates the lightbox to display the message author's avatar
alongside their name and the date in the app bar. The avatar is
positioned in the "start" direction (left for LTR layouts, right for
RTL layouts) to align with the behavior in the React Native app.

Fixes: #41
