autocomplete: Identify when the user intends an emoji autocomplete

The "forbid preceding ':'" wrinkle is one I discovered because of
writing tests: I wrote down the '::^' test, was surprised to find
that it failed, and then went back and extended the regexp to
make it pass.

For this commit we temporarily intercept the query at the
AutocompleteField widget, to avoid invoking the widgets that are
still unimplemented.  That lets us defer those widgets' logic to a
separate later commit.
