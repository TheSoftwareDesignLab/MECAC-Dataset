compose: Implement most of compose box redesign

- We drop `_sendButtonSize` and `_inputVerticalPadding` because we no
  longer need them for setting the button's minHeight, along with
  `ButtonStyle` for the send button that was added in #399, which is
  irrelevant to the new design.

- `ClipRect`'s size is determined by the `ConstrainedBox`.  This is
  mainly for showing the content through the `contentPadding` of the
  `TextField`, so that our `InsetShadowBox` can fade it smoothly there.
  The shadow is always there, but it is only visible when the
  `TextField` is long enough to be scrollable. Discussion here:
    https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/pull/928#issuecomment-2335042432

- For `InputDecorationTheme` on `_ComposeBoxLayout`, we zero out
  `contentPadding` while keeping `isDense` as `true`, to explicitly
  remove paddings on the input widgets.

- The height of the compose buttons is 42px in the Figma design, but
  44px in the implementation.  We change that to match the minimum
  button size per the accessibility recommendation from Apple.

- Note that we use `withFadedAlpha` on `designVariables.textInput` because
  the color is already transparent in dark mode, and the helper allows us
  to multiply, instead of to override, the alpha channel of the color with
  a factor.  Discussion here:
    https://github.com/zulip/zulip-flutter/pull/928#discussion_r1815661095

- DesignVariables.icon's value has been updated to match the current
  design.  This would affect the appearance of the
  ChooseAccountPageOverflowButton on the choose account page, which is
  intentional.

This is "most of" the redesign because the new button feedback is
supported later.
