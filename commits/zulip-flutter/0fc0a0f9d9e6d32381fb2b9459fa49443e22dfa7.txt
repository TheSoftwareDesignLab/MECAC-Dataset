notif: Handle opening of notification on Android using data URL intents

Replaces the notification-open handling provided by
`package:flutter_local_notifications` with a custom Intent data
URL-based approach. Notifications will now be created with a
`PendingIntent` containing a `zulip://notification…` URL.

When a notification is opened, the Android intent's data URL is
passed through Flutter's platform-navigation system, triggering a
route. If the app is already in the foreground, the `ZulipApp`
widget's overridden `didPushRouteInformation` function handles the
route. If the app is not running, the intent data URL becomes the
initial route, read from
`WidgetsBinding.instance.platformDispatcher.defaultRouteName` in
the `ZulipApp` widget.

In both cases, the intent data URL is then passed to
`NotificationDisplayManager.navigateForNotification`, where it is
parsed and used to generate the route to the `MessageListPage` for
the relevant conversation.
