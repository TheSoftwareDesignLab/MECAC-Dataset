logo: Use new design, and support fancy Android features

Fixes #415.
Fixes #1254.
Fixes #1401.
Fixes #1402.

Thanks to Vlad for developing the new design through several
iterations.  Changes from the old version include:

  * The background gradient is more saturated.  (#1254)

  * The "BETA" label is cleaner, and has a more balanced layout
    relative to the main "Z" of the logo.  (#415)

  * The icon is "adaptive" using the API introduced in Android 8,
    which lets it be handled more nicely by Android launchers /
    home screens that want to put the app icon in a circle (like
    on Pixel) or an iOS-style squircle (like on Samsung devices).
    In particular this should avoid it getting shrunk and placed on
    a bed of white padding.  (#1402, originally filed on zulip-mobile
    in 2020.)

  * The assets include a monochrome foreground icon, which makes
    the app work with the "themed icons" introduced in Android 13,
    for users who choose to enable that.  (#1401, originally filed
    on zulip-mobile by a user report last year.)

This commit continues to use "BETA" versions of the logo for the
actual app, but also adds the corresponding non-beta versions of
the source SVGs so that we can smoothly switch to those when it
comes time to launch the app.

The relevant area in Figma is around here:

but the exact story of these source files is somewhat complicated,
because there are a number of technical requirements and it's taken
several rounds of iteration between design and engineering to get to
this result.

Specifically:

  * zulip-white-z-beta-on-transparent.svg was "beta-foreground.svg"
    from Vlad here:
      https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/530-mobile-design/topic/updated.20app.20icon/near/2072480

  * zulip-white-z-on-transparent.svg and zulip-gradient.svg were
    from Vlad in this message (as code blocks):
      https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/530-mobile-design/topic/updated.20app.20icon/near/2038233

  * Then zulip-combined.svg was "app_icon_1.svg" here:
      https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/530-mobile-design/topic/updated.20app.20icon/near/2030417

    which I produced as described in that message from "app_icon.svg"
    here:
      https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/channel/530-mobile-design/topic/updated.20app.20icon/near/2030569

  * And zulip-beta-combined.svg I assembled myself, in a text
    editor, out of those pieces.

  * I also wrote ic_launcher.xml.
