content: Use weightVariableTextStyle for bold spans in code blocks

Now, as the added test confirms, bold spans are getting a `wght`
value of 700, instead of 400 from the ambient style.

render bolder than surrounding text, but in a way that doesn't match
what we get for Source Code Pro with `wght` 700. I think this is
