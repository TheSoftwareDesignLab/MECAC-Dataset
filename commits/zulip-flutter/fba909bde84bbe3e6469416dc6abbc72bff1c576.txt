ui: Provide [StreamColorSwatch]es via DesignVariables, not api/model/

Instead of putting them in Subscription model objects.

This helps toward #95 by bundling this with our other
ThemeExtensions that will switch together between light and dark
variants when the theme changes. It's also just nicer to separate
this very UI-focused code out of api/model/ (#393).

Not marking [nfc] just because of differences in caching logic,
although I don't expect a user-visible perf effect.
