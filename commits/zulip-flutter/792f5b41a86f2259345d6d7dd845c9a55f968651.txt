text [nfc]: Mention min/max in bolderWght's dartdoc

It's reasonable to expect callers to avoid passing around
out-of-bounds "wght" values. If we're at the point of passing an
out-of-bounds value to this function, chances are we're also
rendering some text with that same value, and we shouldn't do that.
