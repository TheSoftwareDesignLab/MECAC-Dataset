compose: Prepare some leafward widgets to support a disabled state

In the upcoming edit-message feature, the edit-message compose box
will have a "Preparing..." state after you tap "Edit message" in the
action sheet, while we're fetching the raw message content. The
edit-message compose box shouldn't be interactable in this state.
