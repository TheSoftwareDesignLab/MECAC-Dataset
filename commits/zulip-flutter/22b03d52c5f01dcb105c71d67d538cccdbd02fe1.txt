unread_count_badge [nfc]: Remove extra API for specific background color

Previously, this widget had three options for the background color:

1. Colorized for a channel: callers could pass a ChannelColorSwatch,
   and the implementation would pick `unreadCountBadgeBackground` off
   of that.
2. Any `Color`.
3. A default, chosen by the implementation.

One caller was using option 2 when option 1 would be a better fit:
it wanted a channel-colored background, but it was picking
`unreadCountBadgeBackground` itself from the ChannelColorSwatch
instead of letting the implementation do that.

After changing that caller to just pass the ChannelColorSwatch
(option 1), no more callers use option 2, so we remove it. Now
UnreadCountBadge has a tighter interface.

Next we'll encapsulate finding the channel color swatch itself, so
callers only need to have a channel ID if they want a
channel-colored background.
