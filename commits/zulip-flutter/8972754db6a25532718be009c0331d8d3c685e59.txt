color [nfc]: Add ColorExtension.withFadedAlpha

And use it everywhere we were using `.withValues(alpha:`
to fade a color variable, except for one place in
`lib/widgets/emoji_reaction.dart` where the variable is
semi-transparent in dark mode to begin with.
We'll do that as a non-NFC change in a later commit.
