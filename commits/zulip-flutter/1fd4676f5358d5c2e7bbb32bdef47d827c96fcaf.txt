msglist: Make date-separator text color match recipient-header dates

I removed the TODO(design), because now this element's color matches
the corresponding element in the web app, and that seems like a fine
way to settle the question. I didn't find a date-separator example
in the Figma (and Greg didn't either, when implementing them
in #469.)
