content: Filter negative margin styles if present on a vlist row

This fixes a bug where if negative margin on a vlist row is present
the widget side code would hit an assert. Displaying the error
(red screen) in debug mode, but in release mode the negative padding
would be applied twice, once by `_KatexNegativeMargin` and another by
`Padding` widget.
