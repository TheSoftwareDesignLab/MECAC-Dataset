    deps: Pin video_player to 2.9.5

    The latest version (2.10.0) makes significant changes internally
    and to the test API, which would require us to investigate and
    update our FakeVideoPlayerPlatform mock for tests.

    So, pin to the currently used version for now.

Upon investigating, the changes to the public API seem mostly
small, namely some deprecations in the platform interface class.
Which is only used in our tests, specifically by
FakeVideoPlayerPlatform. Otherwise, no behaviour change observed
while testing, as we are using the default options, i.e not using
Flutter platform view.
