content: Follow web app in using Source Sans 3, size 14, height 17

Values obtained by looking at the "Computed" tab in the Chrome
DevTools element inspector, on CZO at 8.0-dev-2850-gef1c1ce05f.

Technically the web app has a computed `line-height` of 16.996px,
but that seems like a rounding error.

One reason for doing this now is to opt out of a default that would
take effect with the upcoming migration to Material 3. The text
would otherwise get a line height of 1.43 times the font size, and
we want it to be denser than that. We briefly explored how to
preserve the line height exactly, across the M3 migration, but the
solutions we found seemed more awkward than just taking care of
this now:
