model: Add TypingNotifier

The debugEnable setup is borrowed from
debugEnableRegisterNotificationToken. This acts as a hook to
temporarily disable typing notices in later widget tests.

The documentation and implementation are based on the web app:

  https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/52a9846cdf4abfbe937a94559690d508e95f4065/web/shared/src/typing_status.ts

We do not expose Futures with keystroke/stopComposing.  Because the
caller shouldn't need to wait for the underlying API request to
finish.

Perhaps one nice thing we can do is defining a TypingNotifier mixin
and add that to both PerAccountStore and TypingNotifier, similar to
ChannelStore.  But TypingNotifier is not complicated enough for that
to be worthwhile.
