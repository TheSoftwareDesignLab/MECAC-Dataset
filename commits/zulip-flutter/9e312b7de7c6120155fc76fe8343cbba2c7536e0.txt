text: Bundle 'Source Code Pro' font into the app

Assets and license downloaded from
  https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/tree/d3f1a5962
, so it's version 2.042 for upright, and version 1.062 for italic.

We'll probably want to bundle more fonts into the app, like Source
Sans 3, which we use for most text in Zulip web.

But now at least we can see the process works! :)

Fixes: #64
