notif ios: Navigate when app launched from notification

Introduces a new Pigeon API file, and adds the corresponding
bindings in Swift. Unlike the `pigeon/android_notifications.dart`
API this doesn't use the ZulipPlugin hack, as that is
only needed when we want the Pigeon functions to be available
inside a background isolate (see doc in `zulip_plugin/pubspec.yaml`).

Since the notification tap will trigger an app launch first
(if not running already) anyway, we can be sure that these new
functions won't be running on a Dart background isolate, thus not
needing the ZulipPlugin hack.
