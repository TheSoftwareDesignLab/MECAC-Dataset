emoji: Fix bottom padding of emoji picker

Previously, the body of the bottom sheet was wrapped in `SafeArea`. This
pads the bottom unconditionally, shifting the bottom of the list view
above the device bottom padding.

This is undesirable, because the area beneath the bottom padding is still
visible, and the list view should extend to the bottom regardless of the
bottom inset.

By just removing the `SafeArea`, the list view extends to the bottom.
However, if the bottom padding is more than 8px, we can't scroll past the
last entry in the list view.  Essentially, we want the behavior of
`SilverSafeArea.minimum` — the bottom edge of the list entries should
always be padded by at least 8px, so that we can scroll past the shadow;
and if the bottom padding is more than 8px, use that as the padding
instead.
