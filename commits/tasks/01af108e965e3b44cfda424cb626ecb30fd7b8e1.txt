Fixed sync issues:

  - no more double-synchronizing, which gives "Service invocation failed" error
  - better logging
  - notes are now pushed to RTM if they don't already exist. this is a small hack
  - auto synchronization option
  - hacky screen gesture animations. they're really terrible, but kinda cool
  - completed tasks are marked as done on RTM, not deleted
  - tag-to-list conversion is now case insensitive

  Also, restored full tabs, and added animation xml's.
