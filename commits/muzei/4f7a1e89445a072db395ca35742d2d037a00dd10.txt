Remove Gallery XML theme and colors

This commit removes the XML-based theme (`Theme.Gallery` in `styles.xml`) and all associated color resources (`colors.xml`) for the Gallery source. These are no longer needed as the UI is now fully implemented in Compose, which defines its own theme.

The `GallerySettingsActivity` now extends `ComponentActivity` instead of `AppCompatActivity` and manually controls the status bar appearance to match the Compose theme's dark/light state. The `enableEdgeToEdge()` call has been replaced with `WindowCompat.enableEdgeToEdge()`.

This change also removes several now-unused View-related library dependencies from `build.gradle`, including `appcompat`, `material`, `fragment`, `recyclerView`, and `constraintLayout`.
