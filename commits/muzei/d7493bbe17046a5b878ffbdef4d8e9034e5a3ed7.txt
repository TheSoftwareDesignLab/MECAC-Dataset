Fix logic for setting a dark navigation bar

The unary logic needed to remove the `SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LIGHT_NAVIGATION_BAR` needs to always unset that flag when moving to a dark theme, rather than only updating the flag to its opposite value (which can sometimes swap it from its default dark background to a light theme - the exact opposite of what we wanted).

Fixes #763
