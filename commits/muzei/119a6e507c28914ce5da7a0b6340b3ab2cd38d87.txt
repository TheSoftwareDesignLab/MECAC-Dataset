Move static methods in ProviderContract.Artwork to ProviderClient

Instead of keeping a duplicate of each static method in ProviderClient (one using a Class and another using an authority String), create a new interface called ProviderClient that encapsulates all of the static methods.

MuzeiArtProvider itself implements ProviderClient, while instances can be created from new static methods on ProviderContract.
