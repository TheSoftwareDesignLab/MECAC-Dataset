Refactor: Rewrite Effects screen in Compose

This commit rewrites the `EffectsScreenFragment` from using Android Views with XML layouts to Jetpack Compose.

The previous View-based implementation, which used `SeekBar` and `ConstraintLayout` across multiple XML files, has been entirely replaced by a new `EffectsScreen.kt` Composable. This new Composable uses `Slider` to control the blur, dim, and grey values.

Key changes include:
- A new `EffectsScreen.kt` file containing the Compose UI for the effects settings.
- The `EffectsScreenFragment` now uses `content {}` to set its Compose UI.
- State management for the sliders has been refactored to use a `PreferenceSourcedValue` class, which uses `produceState` and `callbackFlow` to react to `SharedPreferences` changes while also handling user input.
- All associated XML layouts (`effects_screen_fragment.xml`, `effects_screen_fragment_include_content.xml`), drawable resources for the old `SeekBar` styling (`scrubber_*.xml`, `scrubber_*.png`), and related styles and dimensions have been removed.
