Fix: Correctly order graphicsLayer modifier for logo animation

This commit reorders the `graphicsLayer` and `drawWithContent` modifiers on the subtitle `Box` within the `AnimatedMuzeiLogo` composable.

The `graphicsLayer` modifier, which controls the `alpha` of the subtitle text, was previously applied before the `drawWithContent` modifier that handles the vertical translation. This incorrect ordering caused the alpha animation to be applied to the layout space *before* the translation, resulting in visual artifacts where the text would appear outside its intended animated bounds.

By moving `graphicsLayer` to after `drawWithContent`, the alpha modification is correctly applied to the translated content, ensuring the fade animation works as intended within the animated composition.
