Refactor: Migrate Effects screen to Compose

This commit refactors the "Effects" screen from a legacy Fragment-based implementation using `ViewPager2` and XML layouts to a fully declarative UI built with Jetpack Compose.

The `EffectsFragment` has been rewritten to use the `content` extension, hosting a new `EffectsSettings` Composable. This new Composable centralizes the UI and logic, replacing `Toolbar`, `TabLayout`, `ViewPager2`, and the associated `FragmentStateAdapter`. It now uses `Scaffold`, `TopAppBar`, `SecondaryTabRow`, and `HorizontalPager` to achieve the same layout.

Key changes include:

- A new `EffectsSettings.kt` file containing the main Composable for the screen.
- The `EffectsScreenFragment` has been removed, and its logic for managing `SharedPreferences` has been generalized into a new `rememberPreferenceSourcedValue` Composable function and moved to a new `SharedPreferences.kt` file. This new function handles observing preference changes and debouncing updates.
- The logic for linking/unlinking home and lock screen effects and resetting defaults has been moved into the `EffectsSettings` Composable.
- All related XML layouts (`effects_fragment.xml`), menus (`effects_fragment.xml`), and style/dimension resources have been deleted.
- The `viewpager2` dependency has been removed from `build.gradle` and `libs.versions.toml` as it is no longer needed.
