Set light navigation bars in dark theme

This commit ensures that the navigation bar icons and buttons are light-colored when the system is in dark theme, matching the behavior of the status bar.

This is done by setting `isAppearanceLightNavigationBars` to false when the dark theme is active within the `GallerySettingsActivity` Composable.
