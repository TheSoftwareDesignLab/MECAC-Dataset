Rewrite Gallery TopAppBar in Compose

This commit refactors the `Toolbar` in `GallerySettingsActivity` from an XML layout and `MenuProvider`-based implementation to a new `GalleryTopAppBar` Composable.

The new `GalleryTopAppBar` Composable is integrated within a `Scaffold` and manages the display of actions like "Import photos" and "Clear photos" in an overflow menu. The logic for showing the correct "Import" action text based on the number of available provider apps is now self-contained within the Composable.

This change simplifies `GallerySettingsActivity` by removing the `MenuProvider` implementation, `setSupportActionBar`, and related menu-handling logic.

Additionally:
- `gallery_activity.xml` is updated to remove the `AppBarLayout` and `Toolbar`.
- The `gallery_activity.xml` menu resource is deleted as it's no longer used.
- A `Scaffold` is introduced to structure the main screen layout in Compose.
