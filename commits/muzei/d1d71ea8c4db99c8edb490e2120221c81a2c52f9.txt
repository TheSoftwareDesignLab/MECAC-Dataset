Refactor GalleryAdd animations to use AnimatedContent

This commit refactors the `GalleryAdd` composable to use `AnimatedContent` for managing transitions between its different states (FAB, Toolbar, or None). This replaces the previous implementation which used manual `LaunchedEffect` animations with `Animatable`, `SeekableTransitionState`, and `AnimatedVisibility`.

By leveraging `AnimatedContent`, the animation logic is simplified and more declarative. The new implementation defines `enter` and `exit` transitions based on the `initialState` and `targetState`, automatically handling animations for showing and hiding the FAB and the reveal toolbar. This also removes the now-unnecessary custom `drawWithContent` modifier that was used for the circular reveal animation.
