Adds example-contract-widget to show usage of Muzei ContentProvider

This example implements a simple full screen widget such as that requested in #58 as a separate example app by utilizing the Content Provider and ACTION_ARTWORK_CHANGED broadcast to get callbacks on when the artwork changes and read the information without the need for any permissions (such as INTERNET to download the artwork).
