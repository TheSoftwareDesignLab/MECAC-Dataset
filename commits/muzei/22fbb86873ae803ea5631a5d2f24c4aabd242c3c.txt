Adopt predictive back for Gallery Composable transitions

This commit updates the `GalleryAdd` and `GallerySelectionToolbar` Composables to support predictive back gestures.

`BackHandler` has been replaced with `PredictiveBackHandler` in both `GalleryAdd.kt` and `GallerySelectionToolbar.kt`. This allows the UI to animate along with the user's back gesture, providing a smoother and more intuitive experience.

To support this, the animation logic has been refactored:
- In `GalleryAdd`, the `AnimatedContent` transition is now driven by a `SeekableTransitionState`.
- In `GallerySelectionToolbar`, `AnimatedVisibility` has been replaced by a `SeekableTransitionState` and `rememberTransition` to manually control the animation progress during the back gesture.

Finally, `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"` has been added to the `GallerySettingsActivity` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` to enable the predictive back functionality.
