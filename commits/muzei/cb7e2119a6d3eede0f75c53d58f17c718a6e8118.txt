Rewrite GallerySettingsActivity entirely in Compose

This commit refactors `GallerySettingsActivity` to be a fully Compose-based Activity, eliminating the need for XML layouts and multiple `ComposeView`s.

The `gallery_activity.xml` layout file has been removed. All UI, including the photo grid, empty state, "add" FAB/toolbar, and selection toolbar, is now managed within a single `setContent` block. This is enabled by using `androidx.activity.compose.setContent` and `enableEdgeToEdge`.

Key changes:
- `GallerySettingsActivity` no longer inflates an XML layout.
- The separate `ComposeView`s for the photo grid, empty state, add controls, and selection toolbar have been consolidated into a single Composable hierarchy.
- Logic now conditionally displays `GalleryChosenPhotoGrid` or `GalleryEmpty` based on the number of photos.
- `Snackbar`s are now shown using a `SnackbarHost` and `SnackbarHostState` within the `Scaffold`, replacing the previous View-based implementation.
- The `GallerySelectionToolbar` no longer needs to manage its own `safeDrawing` window insets, as this is now handled at the top-level `Scaffold`.
