Rewrite Gallery Import Photos Dialog in Compose

This commit replaces the `GalleryImportPhotosDialogFragment` with a new Composable function, `GalleryImportPhotosDialog`. This dialog is shown when there are multiple apps available to import photos from.

The new `GalleryImportPhotosDialog` is a stateless Composable, with its visibility managed by a `rememberSaveable` state boolean within `GallerySettingsActivity`. This refactoring eliminates the need for the `DialogFragment` subclass and its associated listener interface, simplifying the activity's implementation.

Specifically:
- The `GalleryImportPhotosDialogFragment.kt` file has been deleted.
- A new `GalleryImportPhotosDialog.kt` file has been added, containing the `@Composable` dialog.
- `GallerySettingsActivity` no longer implements `OnRequestContentListener` and now directly manages the state and display of the new Composable dialog.
