Refactor: Convert Choose Provider item to Compose

This commit refactors the UI for displaying individual provider items in the "Choose Provider" screen from an XML layout (`choose_provider_item.xml`) to a Jetpack Compose Composable, `ChooseProviderItem`.

The new `ChooseProviderItem.kt` file defines a stateless Composable that takes a `ProviderInfo` object and displays the provider's icon, title, artwork, description, and action buttons. The layout is built with `Card`, `Row`, and `Column`, and uses `AnimatedContent` to smoothly transition between different states (e.g., showing/hiding the selected icon or action buttons).

To support this refactoring:
- `choose_provider_item.xml` and the associated `ic_source_selected.xml` drawable have been deleted.
- A `rememberDrawablePainter` utility has been added in `util/DrawablePainter.kt` to allow rendering Android `Drawable`s (like provider icons) within Compose, correctly handling animated drawables.
- `ChooseProviderFragment` has been updated to use a `ComposeView` within its `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`. The `ListAdapter` now simply provides the `ProviderInfo` data to the `ChooseProviderItem` Composable, which handles all rendering logic. This significantly simplifies the `ViewHolder` and removes the need for manual view binding and partial update payloads.
