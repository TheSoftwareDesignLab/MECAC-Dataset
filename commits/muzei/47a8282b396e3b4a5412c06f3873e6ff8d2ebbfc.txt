Improve the workflow for importing photos with GET_CONTENT

The previous workflow for importing photos had a number of downsides:
- The warning dialog felt punitive towards the user even though it wasn't their choice that the app they want to use only supports GET_CONTENT
- The standard Storage Access Framework UI allowed users to import photos that they should really be adding via ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT

Since we can query the exact activities supporting GET_CONTENT, we can improve the workflow by:
- Handling only one app by directly starting that Activity
- Handling more than one app by having the user choose which app they want to import photos from

This has the side benefit that there is no need for a scary dialog anymore and photos cannot be imported if adding them directly is an option
