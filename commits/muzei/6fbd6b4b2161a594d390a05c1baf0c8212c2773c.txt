Rewrite Gallery Add FAB/Toolbar in Compose

This commit rewrites the Floating Action Button and reveal toolbar for adding photos and folders in `GallerySettingsActivity` from a traditional View-based implementation to a new Composable function, `GalleryAdd`.

The new `GalleryAdd` Composable manages its state (FAB, toolbar, or none) and animations between states. This simplifies `GallerySettingsActivity` by removing the manual animation logic, `OnBackPressedCallback`, and related View handling.

State is preserved across configuration changes using `saved` from `androidx.savedstate.serialization`. The serialization plugin has been added to support this.

Additionally:
- The `gallery_ic_add.xml` drawable is removed as it is replaced by a Material Icon in Compose.
- The `gallery_activity.xml` layout is updated to replace the FAB and `add_toolbar` LinearLayout with a `ComposeView`.
