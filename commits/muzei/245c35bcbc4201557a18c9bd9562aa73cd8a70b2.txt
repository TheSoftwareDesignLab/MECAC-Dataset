Rewrite BrowseProviderFragment in Compose

This commit rewrites the `BrowseProviderFragment` using Jetpack Compose, replacing the previous XML layouts and RecyclerView adapter.

Key changes include:
- `BrowseProviderFragment.kt`: Rewritten to use `content` to host the new `BrowseProvider` Composable.
- `BrowseProvider.kt`: New Composable function that handles the UI for browsing artwork from a provider. It includes a `TopAppBar`, a `PullToRefreshBox` for refreshing content, and a `LazyVerticalGrid` to display artwork. It also handles artwork clicks and custom actions.
- Deleted XML layouts: `browse_provider_fragment.xml`, `browse_provider_item.xml`, and `browse_provider_fragment.xml` (menu).
- Removed related integer resources: `browse_provider_span_count`.
- Added new string resources for navigation and menu overflow.
- Updated `main_navigation.xml` to remove the `tools:layout` attribute from the `browse_provider` fragment definition.
