Declare Activity configuration changes in Manifest

This commit updates the `AndroidManifest.xml` to declare that `GallerySetupActivity`, `GallerySettingsActivity`, and `GalleryAddPhotosActivity` will handle all configuration changes themselves.

This is achieved by adding `android:configChanges` with a comprehensive list of configuration types to each activity's definition. This prevents the system from recreating these activities on configuration changes like orientation, screen size, or theme changes, improving performance and state retention.
