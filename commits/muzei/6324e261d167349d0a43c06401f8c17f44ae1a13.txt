Move Gradle, build tools, and compile/target SDK values to main build.gradle

In order to not touch every build.gradle file every time either the gradle plugin updates or the build tools updates or the newest SDK comes out, we can move all of these values to the main build.gradle file as suggested here: http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/tips

This update also updates the gradle plugin 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 and build tools 21.1.1 to 21.1.2
