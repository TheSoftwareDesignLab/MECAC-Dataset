Rewrite GalleryChosenPhotoItem in Compose

This commit rewrites the `gallery_chosen_photo_item.xml` layout and its corresponding ViewHolder logic in `GallerySettingsActivity` into a new Composable function, `GalleryChosenPhotoItem`.

The new Composable function handles the display of single images and multiple images (up to four in a 2x2 grid) for folder URIs. It also includes the checkmark overlay animation previously handled by `ViewAnimationUtils`.

The following resources are no longer needed and have been removed:
- `layout/gallery_chosen_photo_item.xml`
- `drawable/gallery_ic_folder.xml`
- `drawable-xxhdpi/gallery_chosen_photo_selected.png`
- `dimen/gallery_chosen_photo_folder_padding`
- `id/gallery_viewtag_position`
- `color/gallery_chosen_photo_placeholder`

The `GallerySettingsActivity` has been updated to use `ComposeView` in its `PhotoViewHolder` and calls the new `GalleryChosenPhotoItem` Composable. The logic for loading images and handling touch events for the selection animation has been moved into the Composable and its parameters.
