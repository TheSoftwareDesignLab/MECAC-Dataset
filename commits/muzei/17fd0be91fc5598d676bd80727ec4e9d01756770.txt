Refactor: Migrate Gestures screen to Compose

This commit refactors the Gestures settings screen from XML and Fragments to Jetpack Compose.

The legacy `gestures_fragment.xml` layout and its corresponding `GesturesFragment.kt` implementation, which used data binding and traditional Android Views, have been removed.

A new `GestureSettings.kt` file has been created, containing a reusable `@Composable` function for the entire screen. The logic within `GesturesFragment` has been updated to use the `content` block to host this new Composable, handle state management with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`, and interact with `SharedPreferences` for persistence.

The unused `ThemeOverlay.Muzei.AccentPrimary` style has also been removed from `styles.xml`.
