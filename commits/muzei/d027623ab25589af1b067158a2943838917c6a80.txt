Fix Watch Face crash while scaling bitmap

On activating the Muzei Watch Face, occationally `onDraw()` will be called between when a background is set (`mBackgroundBitmap != null`) and when the scaled bitmap is created (`mBackgroundScaledBitmap != null`) which led to it attempting to draw a null scaled background. Change `onDraw()` to also check against `mBackgroundScaledBitmap` to prevent crashes.
