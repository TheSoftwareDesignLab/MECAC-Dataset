Rewrite Gallery selection toolbar in Compose

This commit rewrites the selection toolbar in `GallerySettingsActivity` from a traditional View-based implementation to a new Composable function, `GallerySelectionToolbar`.

The new `GallerySelectionToolbar` Composable is state-driven, showing itself with an animation when the selection count is greater than zero. It also handles the back press to clear the selection. This simplifies `GallerySettingsActivity` by removing the manual animation logic and other View-based handling for the selection state. The title of the toolbar now intelligently displays the name of the selected folder if a single folder is selected.

This refactoring also simplifies `MultiSelectionController` by removing the `OnBackPressedCallback`, selection count logic, and its custom callbacks interface.

Additionally:
- `gallery_activity.xml` is updated to replace the `selection_toolbar_container` with a `ComposeView`.
- Unused resources related to the old implementation are removed:
    - `res/menu/gallery_selection.xml`
    - `res/values/dimens.xml`
    - `res/values/ids.xml`
    - `drawable/gallery_ic_action_remove.png`
    - `gallery_theme` and `gallery_theme_dark` colors.
