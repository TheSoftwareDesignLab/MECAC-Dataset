Update to Fragment 1.2.0-beta02

Replace all remaining instances of the <fragment> tag in layout XML. Since creating the child fragment's view happens after the parent's View finishes being created, switch to getting the NavController directly from the NavHostFragment rather than going through container.findNavController().
