Refactor ViewModel initialization in Compose

This commit refactors `GallerySettingsActivity` to initialize the `GallerySettingsViewModel` directly within the Compose hierarchy using the `viewModel()` composable function from `androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel.compose`.

Previously, the ViewModel was retrieved using the `by viewModels()` Kotlin property delegate at the Activity level. This change aligns the ViewModel's scope more closely with its usage within the UI.

The `lifecycle-common` dependency is replaced with `lifecycle-viewmodel` in `build.gradle` to support this new initialization method.
