Refactor: Migrate Tutorial screen to Compose

This commit replaces the legacy XML-based `TutorialFragment` with a new `Tutorial` Composable. The entire UI and its animations are now implemented in Compose, resulting in more modern, declarative, and maintainable code.

The following legacy files have been removed:
- `tutorial_content.xml`
- `tutorial_fragment.xml`
- `tutorial_icon_on_overlay.xml`
- `tutorial_icon_overlay_state_list.xml`
- Associated `dimens` and drawable resources.

Key changes:
- `TutorialFragment` has been refactored to use `content` to host the new `Tutorial` Composable.
- The new `Tutorial` Composable replicates the original animations using Compose's animation APIs (`updateTransition`, `animateFloat`). This includes staggered fade-ins and translation effects for the text and icon.
- A custom `Layout` is used to precisely position the icon and title, similar to the original `RelativeLayout`.
- The click affordance is now handled with a `clickable` modifier and `collectIsPressedAsState` to show a visual tint.
- The `compose-animation-graphics` library has been added to support animated vector drawables in Compose.
