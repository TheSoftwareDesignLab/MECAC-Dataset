Refactor: Convert AnimatedMuzeiLogo to a Composable

This commit refactors the animated Muzei logo from a custom View (`AnimatedMuzeiLogoView`) and Fragment (`AnimatedMuzeiLogoFragment`) implementation into a pure Composable function, `AnimatedMuzeiLogo`.

The new `AnimatedMuzeiLogo` Composable replaces the legacy View-based system, including its XML layout, and is now used in both the `IntroFragment` and the `AboutActivity`. This removes the need for `FragmentContainerView` and `AndroidFragment` and simplifies the animation logic by leveraging Compose's animation APIs like `updateTransition` and `animateFloat`.

Key changes include:
- A new `AnimatedMuzeiLogo.kt` file containing the `AnimatedMuzeiLogo` Composable.
- Deletion of `AnimatedMuzeiLogoView.kt`, `AnimatedMuzeiLogoFragment.kt`, and their associated XML layout `animated_logo_fragment.xml`.
- The logo's subtitle is now a `Text` Composable, and the `logo_subtitle.png` drawable has been removed.
- `IntroFragment` and `AboutActivity` have been updated to use the new `AnimatedMuzeiLogo` Composable, replacing the previous Fragment-based implementation.
- Layout files `intro_fragment.xml` and `layout-land/intro_fragment.xml` now use `ComposeView` instead of `FragmentContainerView`.
