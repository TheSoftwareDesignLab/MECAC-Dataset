Allow multi-window on MuzeiActivity

Instead of using `android:resizeableActivity="false"`, change ArtDetailFragment to support multi-window.

This involved:
1) Adding a SubsamplingScaleImageView to show the image within the multi-window area (as if we used the wallpaper background as in full screen, you wouldn't be able to see the full image. We actually use twof these to ensure we can transition between them without any flickering.
2) Separate the tap gesture to hide the chrome to not rely on system ui visibility in multi-window (since that doesn't work). Note that the bottom app bar is still always visible in multi-window.
