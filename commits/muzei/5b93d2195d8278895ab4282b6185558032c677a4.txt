Refactor: Convert IntroFragment to Compose

This commit refactors the `IntroFragment` to be a fully Compose-based screen, eliminating the need for its corresponding XML layouts and associated resources.

The entire UI, previously defined in `intro_fragment.xml` and `layout-land/intro_fragment.xml`, has been rebuilt as a new `Intro` Composable. This new composable manages its own layout logic, handling both portrait and landscape orientations by using a custom `Layout` to position the animated logo and the "Activate" button.

Key changes include:
- `IntroFragment` now uses `fragment-compose`'s `content` builder to set its view, calling the new `Intro` composable.
- The logic for animating the "Activate" button's appearance is now handled within the `Intro` composable using `LaunchedEffect` and `animateFloatAsState`, replacing the previous implementation that used `binding.activateMuzei.animate()`.
- The "Activate" `Button` has been replaced with a `LargeFloatingActionButton`.

As a result of this refactor, the following files have been deleted:
- `intro_fragment.xml`
- `layout-land/intro_fragment.xml`
- `grey_selectable_item_background_circle.xml`
- `intro_background_protection.xml`
- `white_circle_button.xml`

Additionally, unused styles (`Widget.Muzei.IntroButton`) and dimension resources (`intro_activate_button_size`) related to the old XML layouts have been removed.
