Style: Auto-size FAB text in Intro screen

This commit updates the "Activate" `Text` within the `LargeFloatingActionButton` on the intro screen to use auto-sizing.

By replacing the fixed `fontSize` with `TextAutoSize.StepBased` and adding horizontal padding, the text can now shrink to fit on smaller screens or with larger font scaling settings, preventing it from being truncated.
