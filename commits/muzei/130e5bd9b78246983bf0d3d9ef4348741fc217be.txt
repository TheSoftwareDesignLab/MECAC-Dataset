Rewrite Gallery empty state in Compose

This change rewrites the empty state view in `GallerySettingsActivity` from a traditional Android View-based layout to a new Composable function, `GalleryEmpty`.

The new `GalleryEmpty` Composable centralizes the logic for displaying different empty states based on storage permission status (granted, partially granted, or denied). It is state-driven, observing a `StateFlow` of the permission status.

This refactoring removes the `ViewAnimator` and related Views from `gallery_activity.xml` and replaces them with a single `ComposeView`.

A new `only()` extension function for `PaddingValues` has been added to selectively apply padding to specific sides.
