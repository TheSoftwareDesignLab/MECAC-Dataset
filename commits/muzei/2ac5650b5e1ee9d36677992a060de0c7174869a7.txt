Update Jetpack libraries for July 2nd release

- AppCompat 1.1.0-rc01
- ExifInterface 1.1.0-beta01
- Fragment 1.2.0-alpha01
- Lifecycle 2.2.0-alpha02
- Navigation 2.1.0-alpha06
- Preference 1.1.0-rc01
- RecyclerView 1.1.0-beta01

With this, we can remove explicit dependencies on lifecycle-runtime-ktx and lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx when using fragment-ktx:1.2.0-alpha01 as they are now pulled in as a transitive dependency via activity-ktx.

We also can remove calls to ViewCompat.requestApplyInsets(view) in onViewCreated() since that is done for us by FragmentManager.
