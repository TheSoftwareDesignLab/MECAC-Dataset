fix_4/#90 - better space management and code readability for SearchResult

Impacted files:
* `openfoodfacts.dart`: removed any reference to translated fields, that are now automatically computed
* `Product.dart`: automatically computed the translated categories and labels
* `ProductHelper.dart`: deprecated the method to translate fields, which is automatic now
* `SearchResult.dart`: removed the confusing and space-consuming raw `jsonProducts` field; let the `fromJson` method point to the json annotation generated method
* `SearchResult.g.dart`: removed the confusing and space-consuming raw `jsonProducts` field
