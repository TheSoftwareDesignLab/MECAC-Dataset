feat: #566 - refactored Nutriments as Map with new Nutrient class (#570)

Deleted file:
* `Nutriments.g.dart`

New file:
* `Nutrient.dart`: Nutrient
* `OffTagged`: Interface about OFF code unification.
* `PerSize.dart`: Used for nutrient values: for which size of the product?

Impacted files:
* `api_getProduct_test.dart`: refactored
* `api_getProductRaw_test.dart`: refactored
* `api_getRobotoff_test.dart`: unrelated test fix
* `api_saveProduct_test.dart`: refactored
* `api_searchProducts_test.dart`: unrelated test fix; refactored
* `Nutriments.dart`: heavy refactoring - now we use a simple Map, and most of the fields are deprecated
* `NutrimentsHelper.dart`: refactored
* `Product.dart`: removed `const`s that are now in `PerSize`
* `pubspec.yaml`: upgraded dart version to 2.17
