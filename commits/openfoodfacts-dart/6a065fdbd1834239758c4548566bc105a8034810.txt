feat: Support for source fields in the Knowledge panel API (#409)

* Support for source fields (source_language, source_lc, source_text & source_url) that may be available in text elements within a knowledge panel

* Add trailing comma to the `KnowledgePanelTextElement` constructor
+ remove my awful test method… 🤦‍♂️

* Add a unit test to test if all `source_*` fields from a text element with a knowledge panel  are well parsed

* A `dart format` later 😇
