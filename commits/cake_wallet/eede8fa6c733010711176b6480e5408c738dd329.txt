CW-959: Swap Status on Transaction Screen (#2247)

* feat(swap-status-monitor): add real-time swap status monitoring and UI updates

- Introduce SwapManager for automatic tracking of active-wallet swaps.
- Automatically queues new or updated trades from the Hive box.
- Periodically fetch and persist swap statuses via the corresponding trade provider.
- Implement start(wallet, providers), stop(), and dispose() for lifecycle control.
- Apply user's ExchangeApiMode(disabled, tor-only, enabled) when fetching updates.
- Remove swaps from the watchlist on any final state (completed, expired, failed).
- Dispose SwapManager in AppState.dispose() to cancel polling and the Hive subscription.

* refactor(swap-status): replace SwapManager with TradeMonitor for improved trade monitoring.

This change improves the flow by simplifying the trade monitoring logic.

- Removes SwapManager class and replace with TradeMonitor implementation
- Update di and Appstate to register and dispose TradeMonitor
- Modify DashboardViewModel to use TradeMonitor instead of SwapManager

* fix: Modify trade monitoring logic to ensure trade timers are properly disposed when wallet switching occurs

* fix(swap-status): Fix receive amount for exchanges showing as .00 because of null values
