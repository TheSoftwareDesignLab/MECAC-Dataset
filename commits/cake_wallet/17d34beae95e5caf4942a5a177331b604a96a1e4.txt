CW-782: Show error report popup without cooldown (#1739)

* improve exception throwing on broken wallets
- put _lastOpenedWallet to avoid issues on windows (file is currently open by)
- don't throw corruptedWalletsSeed - instead store it inside of secureStorage
- await ExceptionHandler.onError calls where possible to makse sure that popup won't be canceled by some UI element
- adjust BaseAlertDialog to be scrollable if the text is too long
- add ExceptionHandler.resetLastPopupDate - that can be called when we want to show error report screen (bypassing cooldown)

* fix: HiveError: Box has already been closed.

* await the alerts to be sure that each one of them is being shown
fix typo in secure storage

* Update lib/core/backup_service.dart
