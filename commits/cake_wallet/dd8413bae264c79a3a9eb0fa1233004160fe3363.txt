CW 818: Improve Passphrase Discoverability When Restoring (#2224)

- Switches the main CTA for the page to "Add Passphrase" when the checkbox is checked
- Pops up a bottomsheet with input fields for the passphrase when the "Add Passphrase" button is pressed
- Completes the flow and restores the wallet with the passphrase when the "Restore" button on the bottomsheet is pressed
- Hides the passphrase input fields in AdvancedSettings page when its a restore flow.
