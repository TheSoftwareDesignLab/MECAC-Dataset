* feat: Migrate to Material 3 Theming

Foundation, Theme Data Refactor, and First Extension Cleanup Batch.

This commit completes the first major phase of migrating to Material 3 theming by setting up the foundations for material 3 integration and begins the initial migration, removing custom theme extensions, updating theme data, and refactoring all relevant widget and page theming to use Material 3’s built-in color and typography tokens.

These changes:
- Lays the groundwork for Material 3 theming by restructuring the app’s theme configuration to use Material 3’s ColorScheme and TextTheme as the primary sources of color and typography throughout the app.
- Refactors the core theme config files by removing legacy custom color roles ensuring all color definitions now map directly to Material 3’s role.
- Begins the first batch migration of custom theme extensions (InfoTheme, PlaceholderTheme, KeyboardTheme, PinCodeTheme) and updates all affected widgets and pages to use Material 3 color and typography tokens instead of the custom properties.
- Cleans up the codebase by deleting the files of the initial set of migrated extensions and eliminating all related imports and usages.

- Updates the themes README.md file to reflect the current structure and give more information based on the first major phase that was completed.
