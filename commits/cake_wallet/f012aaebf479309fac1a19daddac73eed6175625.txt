Cw 363 back button on receive screen in bright theme is white (#910)

* feat: Add missing title on wallet_list_page.dart

* feat: add bool lightTitleColor value when theme needs lighter color title, instead of hardcoding to Colors.white

- Light color theme taken from Share button from receive page

* fix: revert changes & use currentTheme.type to use proper theme style

* fix: use share button color logic also on overriden leading Widget on address_page

* refactor: remove unnecessary titleColor
