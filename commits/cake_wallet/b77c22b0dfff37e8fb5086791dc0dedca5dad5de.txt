Update Theme Setup (#2300)

* refactor(theme-setup-update): Move didChangePlatformBrightness lifecycle method to Root widget instead of AppState. We already have an active WidgetsBindingObserver in Root widget.

* fix(theme): Add workaround for flutter iOS didChangePlatformBrightness issue causing unneeded rebuilds.
