Handle Network Connection Errors (#2213)

* fix(moralis-nft-errors): guard against concurrent NFT fetches and adjusts the message being presented to the user.

Previously multiple calls to get NFTs for the currently opened wallet could overlap and queue the error bottom sheet multiple times.

This change:
- Registers the NFTViewModel as a lazySingleton so its isLoading flag persists.
- Adds an early return in the call to fetch the wallet NFTs when isLoading is already true.
- Cleans up the error message being displayed to the user when there is an error.

* feat(moralis-nft-error): localize error message in NFTViewModel

* feat(nft/wc-bottom-sheet): Revamped the flow, service, theme, and UI for smoother UX

Revamps bottom‑sheet handling end‑to‑end to deliver a much more smoother experience.

This change:
- Refactors the BottomSheetService queueing logic to prevent races and ensure strict sequencing
- Update theme extensions and styling for the bottom‑sheet components
- Adds the option to either auto dismiss or allow user manually dismiss the bottomsheet

* fix: Context clash when entering the wallets on airplane mode. The flushbar clashes with the bottomSheet and results in it blocking entry to the selected wallet.

This change:
- Moves the logic for fetching nft to the listing  page, no need fetching if the user does not route to the page,
- Routes to balance page when entering from wallet list page
- Adds a fade transition when entering the dashboard
- Reverts nftViewModel registeration to be a factory

* fix: Revert animation for now, prior to when the UX overhaul for the app is done

* fix: Remove duplicate registration
