* disable exchange_flow_test.dart [run tests] [skip slack]

* Run tests on linux always (since nobody ever used [run tests])

* fix tests after ui updates

* [skip slack] tests update

* Fixing tests WIP

* Fix create wallet integraiton test flow

* Update and fix Exchange flow test flow

* Switch printV to printToConsole

* Adjustments to the the flows on Send and Exchange

* feat: Modify Exchange and send tests to fit new flow

* fix:
- Pause screenshots for now, results in a super large json response file
- Fix delay on send bottomsheet because of pumpAndSettle animation
- Fix issue with integration test runner script

* fix(integration-tests): Fix issues relating to send flow integration tests.

This change:
- Handles the slider during the send confirmation flow during the send integration test
- Adds the missing seeds for the restore flow to the relevant workflow files

* feat: Enhance Send flow Automation Integration Test Flow

This change:
- Updates test wallet address in CommonTestConstants.
- Modifies startAppFlow to accept a dynamic key.
- Improves waitForSendPage and checkIfSendPageIsVisible methods for better page visibility handling.
- Adds validateWalletBalance method to ensure sufficient funds before sending.
- Enhances transaction success flow handling in SendPageRobot.

* refactor: Update SendPageRobot for improved transaction state handling

This change:
- Adds support for the TransactionCommitted state in the SendPageRobot.
- Removes the handleSendResult method to streamline the send flow.
- Enhances checks for successful transaction completion by verifying navigation to the DashboardPage.
- Improves visibility handling for the contact addition dialog in the transaction success flow.

* chore: Update automated integration test workflow

This change:
- Updates apkl file naming to use sanitized branch names for better consistency.
- Adds a step to output system environment information to aid in troubleshooting.
- Enhances KVM setup with checks to see if device exists and there is proper permission.
- Adjusts working directory references for Android emulator setup.

* chore: Enhance automated integration test workflow

This change:
- Adds cleanup steps for existing emulator processes to ensure fresh environment.
- Updates APK file naming to use sanitized branch names for consistency.
- Enhances debug output for APK file creation and searching, improving visibility during the workflow.

* chore: Modify apk file renaming step in workflow

* chore: Enhance automated integration test workflow

This change:
- Increases timeout for integration tests to 60 minutes.
- Adds a timeout of 90 minutes for the automated integration test job.
- Improves KVM setup with detailed checks and outputs for existing device, permissions, and functionality.
- Adds system resource checks to provide information on memory, disk space, and CPU cores during the workflow.
- Implements error handling for the integration test runner to ensure graceful failure reporting.

* chore: Enhance AVD configuration and emulator management in integration test workflow

* refactor: Improve transaction history flow tests and item visibility checks

This change:
- Enhances the scrolling logic in the CommonTestCases to check for item visibility before scrolling.
- Adds error handling and logging for transaction history checks in TransactionsPageRobot.
- Adds comprehensive item checks and scrolling for more reliable tests.

* refactor: Modify integration test runner for improved error handling and logging

This change:
- Implements error handling and logging throughout the integration test runner.
- Introduces a cleanup function for data directories and signal handling.
- Enhances test execution with retry logic and detailed duration tracking.
- Provides a comprehensive summary of test results, including passed and failed tests with their durations.

* refactor: Update error handling in transaction history flow tests

* refactor: Remove manual emulator startup logic from integration test workflow

This change simplifies the automated integration test workflow by removing the manual emulator startup process, which was previously included to handle cases where no emulator was running. The workflow now focuses on checking the emulator status and gathering device information without attempting to start an emulator manually.

* refactor: Enhance integration test workflow and error handling

* feat: Add emulator readiness checks and enhance send flow tests

This change:
- Modifies the send flow test to send $1 worth of any of the wallet currencies
- Set up switching between test wallet in case there's zero balance in any of the wallets when the test is run
- Add a mini script to check emulator readiness for the tests

* fix: More CI workflow errors for the tests

* refactor: Update emulator readiness checks and error handling in CI workflow

* fix: Readiness check successful but broken pipe when accessing settings service, plus some syntax errors in the workflow

* refactor: Enhance integration tests with improved visibility checks and timing adjustments

This change:
- Adds visibility checks for widgets before interaction in various test flows.
- Introduces consistent pump and settle durations to ensure UI stability during tests.
- Refines scrolling logic to confirm wallet types are visible before selection.
- Updates tap actions to include warnings for missed taps, improving test reliability.

* fix: Issues with confirm seeds and keys Automated test

* fix: Add missing await for tap calls

* fix: Temporarily disable CI workflow and minor cleanup to testflows

* fix: Add missing keys to CI workflow

* chore: Temporarily disable Automation CI

* chore: Cleanup
