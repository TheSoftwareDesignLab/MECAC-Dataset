feat: Introduce "One Seed - Multiple Wallets" for BIP39

Implements the shared seed functionality, allowing users to create multiple wallets from a single BIP39 mnemonic phrase.

Key changes include:
- Create new wallets (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, BitcoinCash, Nano) using an existing BIP39 seed.
- Group and manage related wallets, with options to name and organize these groups.
- Significant UI/UX adjustments, refactors, and bug fixes across the application to support the new multi-wallet and grouping features, based on extensive review and QA feedback.
