Feature: Reordering of downloaded sessions

Reordering feature:
- Added new functionality to long press a downloaded session to drag it
into a new order of choice

Downloads widget:
- Refactored the _getDownloadList method to return a ReorderableListView
which provides the onReorder property
- This callback is called once a list item has been reordered and executes
logic to adjust the index of the reordered item
- Furthermore a method to save the new order is called

- Even though a .builder constructor is available for the ReorderableListView
widget, using it caused the Dismissible functionality of the list items to
not work anymore, thus the default constructor is used
- Therefore the itemBuilder prop has been replaced with the children prop
where the download list is mapped to a list of corresponding sliding items

- Added a ValueKey based on the MediaItems id to the outer InkWell of
the Widget returned by the _getSlidingItem method, so that the
ReorderableListView can distinguish between different list items

Downloads Bloc:
- Added a new method to save a given List of MediaItems
- This method is required to save the update order of downloaded sessions
