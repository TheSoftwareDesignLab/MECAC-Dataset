Fix: Context aware pick narrator/duration text

String constants:
- Adjusted the name of the string for picking a narrator and duration
and adjusted its content to not be upper case (like the other strings)
- Added new string to display when only a duration is has to be picked

Sessions options screen:
- Added a boolean to the buildOptionsPanel method which is true, if the
VoiceItems to display contains atleast one narrator, so if the headerValue
on atleast one of the VoiceItems is not empty
- If no narrator is contained in the items, the boolean value is false
- The boolean is used to display the according text strng above the
narrator/duration section
