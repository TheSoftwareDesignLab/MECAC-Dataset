refactor: Wrap ViewPosts AsyncTask post-execution in UI thread

The `onPostExecute` method of `getRecentPostsTask` in `ViewPosts.java` is now explicitly executed on the main UI thread using `getActivity().runOnUiThread()`. This provides an additional guarantee for UI-related operations, such as showing alerts and refreshing the post list, to prevent potential threading issues.

Includes extensive code reformatting in `ViewPosts.java` for improved readability.
Removes unused imports (`WPAlertDialogFragment`, `FragmentTransaction`) from `Dashboard.java`.
