refactor: Use SP units for text sizes and update stats cell
This change standardizes text size units from `dp` (density-independent pixels) to `sp` (scale-independent pixels) across various layouts and styles. Using `sp` units ensures text scales according to user font preferences, improving accessibility.

Affected files include:
*   `home_row.xml`
*   `WordPress/src/main/res/values-sw720dp/styles.xml`
*   `WordPress/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml`

Additionally, the `textSize` dimension reference for the avatar view in `stats_list_cell.xml` was updated to `@dimen/text_sz_double_extra_large` for proper display.
