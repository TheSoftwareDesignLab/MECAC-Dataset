refactor: Unify post list layout toggle menu UI state

Refactors the management of the post list view layout toggle menu item.
The menu item's icon and title are now encapsulated within a
`PostListViewLayoutTypeMenuUiState` sealed class.

This change:
- Centralizes the UI representation (icon and descriptive title) for
  each layout type (Standard/Compact).
- The ViewModel now exposes a single `UiState` object, simplifying the
  Activity's observation and rendering logic.
- Introduces new string resources for clearer menu titles.
