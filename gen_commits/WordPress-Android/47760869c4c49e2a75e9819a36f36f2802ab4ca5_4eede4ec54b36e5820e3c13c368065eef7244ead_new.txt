feat: Support clickable links and bold text in Stats Guide Cards

Refactor `ListItemGuideCard` to use `SpannableString` for dynamic text formatting,
replacing HTML parsing for improved control over styling and interactions.

- The "Total Likes" guide card now includes a clickable link to the latest post
  and bolds the like count, with navigation and analytics tracking on tap.
- The "Total Followers" guide card is now displayed conditionally when the
  total followers count is zero or negative.
- Updates `GuideCardViewHolder` to handle `SpannableString` content.
- Adjusts string resources by removing inline HTML tags, as formatting is
  now handled programmatically.
