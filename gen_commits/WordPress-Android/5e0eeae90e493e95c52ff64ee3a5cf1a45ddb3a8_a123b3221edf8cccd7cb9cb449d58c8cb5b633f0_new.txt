refactor: Unify ReaderTagsFeed states for better granularity

Refactors the ReaderTagsFeed UI state management to allow for more granular control over individual tag chips and their associated post lists.

Previously, the UI used distinct top-level UiStates (e.g., LoadedTagsLoadingPosts) which managed the overall loading sequence. This meant the entire feed was in a single, broad loading state.

The new structure introduces nested sealed classes (TagChip and PostList) within a unified UiState.Loaded. This enables the UI to:
- Display loading indicators for specific tags or post lists independently.
- Show a mix of loaded, loading, and error states for different sections of the feed simultaneously, improving perceived performance and user experience during partial data availability.
