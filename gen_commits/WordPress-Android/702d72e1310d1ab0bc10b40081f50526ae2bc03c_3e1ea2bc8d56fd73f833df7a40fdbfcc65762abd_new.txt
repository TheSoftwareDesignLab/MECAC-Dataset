feat: Implement unified login flow for email entry screen

This commit introduces a new unified login experience, controlled by a `UNIFIED_LOGIN_AVAILABLE` flag.

Key changes include:
- Refactored `LoginEmailFragment` to display a new UI when unified login is enabled.
- Replaces the old "Log in with Google" button and "Alternatively" label with a new "Continue" button for email and a "Continue with Google" button.
- Updates associated Terms of Service links for the new flow.
- Modifies the toolbar to display "Get Started" as the title and includes a new toolbar icon.
- Adds new string resources, color, drawable, and layout files to support the unified UI.
- Updates styling for menu icons.
