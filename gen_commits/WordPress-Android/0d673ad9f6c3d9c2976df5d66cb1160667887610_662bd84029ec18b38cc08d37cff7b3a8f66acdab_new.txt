refactor(layout): Migrate ImageViews to srcCompat and simplify layout

Replaced `app:icon` with `app:srcCompat` for ImageView components in
`switch_to_jetpack_menu.xml` to ensure correct vector drawable rendering.
Removed the unused `guideline2` and refactored the Jetpack icon's layout
attributes for clarity and explicit control, including renaming its ID.
