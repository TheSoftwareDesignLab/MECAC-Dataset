refactor(resources): Remove deprecated Stories and add notification strings

Removed a large number of string resources related to the Stories feature, which has been deprecated or removed. Also cleaned up a few other minor unused Gutenberg Native and Jetpack strings.

Added `notifications_unread_content_description` and `notifications_action_mark_all_as_read` to support enhancements in the notifications section.
