refactor: Simplify post list header layout

Removed the author selection spinner and the associated fading edge view from the post list activity header. This simplifies the UI by removing these components and their related layout constraints.

Also added `android:importantForAccessibility="no"` to the `TabLayout` and `ViewPager` (`postPager`) as their content is typically managed visually and announcing them directly may be redundant for accessibility services.
