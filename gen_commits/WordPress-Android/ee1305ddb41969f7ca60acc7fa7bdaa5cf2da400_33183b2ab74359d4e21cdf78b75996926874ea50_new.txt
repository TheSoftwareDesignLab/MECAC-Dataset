refactor: Rename CampaignListingUiState properties and make error button optional

Renamed properties like `loadingImage` to `image`, `errorTitle` to `title`, and `buttonTitle` to `text` for improved clarity and conciseness within the CampaignListingUiState.
The error button in the Error state is now nullable, allowing for error messages that do not require user interaction.
