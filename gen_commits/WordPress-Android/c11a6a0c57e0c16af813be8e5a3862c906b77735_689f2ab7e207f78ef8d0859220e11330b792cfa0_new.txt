refactor: Move media URL replacement logic to AztecEditorFragment

Extracts Aztec-specific logic for replacing local media IDs with remote
URLs after successful uploads. This code was moved from
MediaUploadReadyProcessor to a new static helper method
`replaceMediaFileWithUrl` in AztecEditorFragment.

This improves modularity and co-locates Aztec content manipulation
within its dedicated editor component.
