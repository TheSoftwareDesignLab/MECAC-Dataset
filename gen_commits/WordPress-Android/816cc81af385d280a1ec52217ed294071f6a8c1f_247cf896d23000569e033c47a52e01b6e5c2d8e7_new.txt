refactor: ReaderFilterChipGroup animations and state management

Revamped the animation logic for the Reader filter chips. Replaced
`AnimatedContent` with `AnimatedVisibility` and used fine-grained
animation APIs (`animateContentSize`, `animateColorAsState`, etc.)
for smoother transitions. Also simplified the filter data model.
