refactor: Handle prepublishing item colors via UiState

Moves the responsibility of determining text colors for prepublishing home items
from the `PrepublishingHomeViewHolder` to the `PrepublishingHomeItemUiState`.

Previously, the ViewHolder would implicitly set colors (e.g., gray_20 for disabled)
based on the `actionEnabled` flag. This change introduces `actionTypeColor` and
`actionResultColor` properties to `HomeUiState`.

The `PrepublishingHomeViewModel` now explicitly sets these color resources
(e.g., R.color.gray_20 for private posts) when constructing the UiState.
The ViewHolder then directly applies the provided colors, leading to a clearer
separation of concerns between view logic and UI state presentation.
