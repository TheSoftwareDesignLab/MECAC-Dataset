feat: Auto-retry failed media uploads on connection status change

Renamed `onMediaRetryAllClicked` to `onMediaRetryAll` in `EditorFragmentListener` and its implementations.
Automatically retries all pending failed media uploads when the network connection status changes, ensuring uploads resume once connectivity is restored.
The list of failed media IDs is cleared after initiating the retry.
