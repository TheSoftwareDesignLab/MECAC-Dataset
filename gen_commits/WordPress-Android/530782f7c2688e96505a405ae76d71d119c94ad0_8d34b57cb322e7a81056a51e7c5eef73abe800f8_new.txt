fix: Address Android 5 dialog title and refactor category layout

* Apply `windowNoTitle` and `windowActionBar` to `WordPress.Dialog` style
  to fix title styling issues on Android 5.
* Refactor `add_category.xml` layout:
    * Replaced `fill_parent` with `match_parent`.
    * Switched to `@dimen/margin_large` for padding.
    * Restructured `OK` and `Cancel` buttons into a `LinearLayout`
      with weighted children for consistent sizing.
