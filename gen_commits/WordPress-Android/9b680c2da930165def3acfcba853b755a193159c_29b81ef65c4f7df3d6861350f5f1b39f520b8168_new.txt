refactor: Introduce Button data class for text styling

The `ImageButton` component previously accepted a `UiString` for its text and applied some fixed styling.
This commit introduces a new `Button` data class that encapsulates the `UiString` along with a comprehensive set of text styling properties (e.g., color, font size, font weight).
By passing an instance of `Button` to the `ImageButton`, consumers can now customize the button's text appearance directly, making the `ImageButton` more flexible and reusable across different UI contexts.
Updates `BlazeOverlayFragment` to utilize this new `Button` component structure.
