feat: Auto-open privacy settings via intent

Introduces functionality to automatically navigate to the privacy settings screen when the AppSettingsFragment is launched with a specific intent extra.
The fragment now checks for `EXTRA_SHOW_PRIVACY_SETTINGS`. If true, it programmatically opens the privacy settings preference and tracks an analytics event.
A new helper method `openPreference` was added to encapsulate the logic for finding and simulating a click on a preference item within the screen.
