feat: Enhance featured image upload experience

Introduce `FeaturedImageHelper` to encapsulate featured image upload and display logic, moving it out of `EditPostSettingsFragment`.
Display dedicated progress and retry/failure overlays with options to retry, cancel, or remove featured image uploads from the post settings screen.
Integrate `FeaturedImageHelper` into `EditPostActivity` for canceling failed uploads.
