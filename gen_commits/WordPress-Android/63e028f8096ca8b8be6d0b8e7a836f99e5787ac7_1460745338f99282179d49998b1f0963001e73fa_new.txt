fix: Limit hardware layer type workaround to KitKat

The hardware layer type was previously set unconditionally for a rotation
animation to prevent drawable fading on Android 4.4.3 (KitKat).
This change ensures the workaround is only applied on KitKat devices,
avoiding potential overhead on newer Android versions where the issue
is resolved or handled differently.
