feat: Improve theme browser empty state handling

Enhance user experience by distinguishing between an initial empty state
(e.g., no themes fetched, network error) and a "no results found" state
after filtering.

A new `getUnfilteredCount()` method is used to determine if any themes
have ever been loaded. The display is dynamically updated via a
`DataSetObserver` registered on the adapter.
