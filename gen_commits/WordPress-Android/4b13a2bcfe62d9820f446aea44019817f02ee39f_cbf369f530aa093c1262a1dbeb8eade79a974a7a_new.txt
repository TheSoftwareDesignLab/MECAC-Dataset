feat: Revamp Quick Start guidance for pages and homepage

Removed the 'Browse Theme', 'Customize Site', and 'Create New Page' quick start tasks.
Introduced 'Review Pages' and 'Edit Homepage' tasks to guide users through site content management.
The MySite and Pages sections now feature updated prompts and focus points relevant to these new tasks, specifically highlighting the homepage for editing.
Analytics tracking, string resources, and quick start task definitions have been updated accordingly.
