refactor: Introduce new UI model and ViewHolder for post list items

Introduces a dedicated `PostListItemUiModel` to encapsulate all display data
for a post list item, separating UI state from domain models.
A new `PostListItemViewHolder` is added to bind this model to the
`post_list_item.xml` layout. The `PostListAdapter` is updated to utilize
these new components, improving maintainability and testability of the
post list display. Also simplifies featured image dimensions.
