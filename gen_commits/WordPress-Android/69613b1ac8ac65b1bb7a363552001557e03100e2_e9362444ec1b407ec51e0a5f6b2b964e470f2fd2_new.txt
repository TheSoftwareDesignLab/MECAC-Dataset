feat: Implement two-pane notification view on tablets

Introduces new layout files for `large-mdpi` and `sw720dp` screens, enabling a
side-by-side master-detail view for notifications.

Updates `NotificationsActivity` to conditionally add fragment transactions to
the back stack. This prevents incorrect back navigation behavior when
replacing only the detail pane in the new two-pane layouts, as the list
view remains visible and is not replaced.
