refactor: Update custom views for AppCompat compatibility

- AutoResizeTextView now extends AppCompatTextView for improved
  compatibility and modern Android features.
- Added @SuppressLint("AppCompatCustomView") to WPEditText to suppress
  lint warning, acknowledging its direct EditText extension in a
  deprecated component.
