refactor: Consolidate and standardize UI background colors

Moved specific layout backgrounds (e.g., calypso_blue_light, background_grey) to a global `android:windowBackground` theme attribute. Standardized other layout backgrounds to `@color/white`. This improves consistency and centralizes UI background management.
