refactor: Update UI after successful post publish settings save

Ensure the UI model is refreshed only upon successful completion of the post settings update. Moved `updateUiModel` into the `onSuccess` callback of `editPostRepository.updateAsync`.
Also, `onPostStatusChanged` LiveData now uses `postValue` for updates.
