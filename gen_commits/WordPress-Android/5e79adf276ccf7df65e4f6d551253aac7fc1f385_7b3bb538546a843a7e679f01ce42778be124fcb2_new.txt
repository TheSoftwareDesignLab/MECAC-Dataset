refactor(reader): Refine photo card text length calculation

Improved logic for determining PHOTO card type based on post text length.
The previous check could be inaccurate due to HTML in the excerpt.

New logic first checks raw text lengths for quick exit. If needed, it strips
HTML to accurately measure content and confirm minimal text for a PHOTO card,
optimizing performance by avoiding expensive HTML stripping when possible.
