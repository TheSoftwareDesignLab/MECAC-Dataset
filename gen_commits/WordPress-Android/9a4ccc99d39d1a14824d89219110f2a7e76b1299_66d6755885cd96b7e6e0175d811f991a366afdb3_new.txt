feat: Animate dropdown button content and adjust spacing

Adds `animateContentSize` modifier to the dropdown menu button's inner row
for smoother transitions when content, such as icons, changes size or
visibility. Introduces vertical padding to the text component for better
visual alignment and spacing within the button.
