fix: Reinitialize PullToRefresh on configuration changes

The PullToRefreshLayout can be destroyed during configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation), breaking its functionality. This commit re-initializes the PullToRefreshHelper in onConfigurationChanged for NotificationsListFragment and PostsListFragment, preserving the refreshing state. The initialization logic was extracted into a dedicated helper method.
