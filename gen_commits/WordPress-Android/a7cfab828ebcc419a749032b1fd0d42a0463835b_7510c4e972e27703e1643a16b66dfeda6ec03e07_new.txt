- Defining `BotConversation` and `BotMessage` data models.
- Creating `AIBotSupportViewModel` for managing UI state and interactions.
- Integrating the new activity into `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- Adding necessary string resources for the UI.
- Updating `AppThemeM3` to allow app-specific theming for Compose screens.
