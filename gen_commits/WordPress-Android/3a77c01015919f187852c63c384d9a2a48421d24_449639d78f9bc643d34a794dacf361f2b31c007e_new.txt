feat: Add AutoResizeTextView and refactor AppLog output

Introduce a new AutoResizeTextView component to automatically adjust text size
to fit within view bounds, with optional ellipsis for overflow.

Refactor AppLog to return log entries as an ArrayList<String> rather than
a single HTML string, allowing for more flexible display handling.
Add HEADER_LINE_COUNT constant for log processing.

Update WordPressUtils version to 1.2.0.
Add a top-level README.md and relocate the WordPressUtils README.md.
