feat: Add Jetpack Move screen for Stats feature

Introduces `JetpackMoveFragment` and `JetpackMoveViewModel` to handle the flow for moving Jetpack features. The fragment is built with Jetpack Compose, showing a loading state and then content based on the provided data. This initial implementation supports displaying a feature name, exemplified by 'Stats', to prepare for Jetpack feature migration.
