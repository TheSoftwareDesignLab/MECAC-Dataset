fix: Restrict RTL support to Android API 18+

The `android:supportsRtl` attribute in `AndroidManifest.xml` is now conditionally enabled
using a new boolean resource (`@bool/min_sdk_18`). This ensures that Right-to-Left (RTL)
layout support is active only on Android API level 18 (Jelly Bean MR2) and higher.
This change prevents potential compatibility issues or unexpected behavior of RTL
layouts on older Android versions that may not fully support the feature.
