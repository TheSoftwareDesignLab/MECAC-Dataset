feat: Add strings for comment editing and domains UI

This commit introduces a collection of new and updated strings to support
several UI enhancements:

- **Comment Editing**: Added strings for a new comment editing flow,
  including field labels ("Done", "Name", "Comment", "Web address",
  "Email address"), validation errors, and a discard changes dialog.
- **Domains Management**: Implemented strings to improve the domains
  section, covering:
    - Primary site address details and options.
    - Display of domain expiration dates, including a "soon-to-expire" state.
    - New strings for domain suggestions pricing (free/paid).
    - Refined descriptions for redirected domains and plan-specific claims.
- **Other UI**:
    - Renamed debug cookie "domain" hint to "host" hint for clarity.
    - Added "Help & Support" label.
    - Included a new Gutenberg block string `gutenberg_native_s_link`.
