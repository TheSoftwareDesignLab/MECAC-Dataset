feat: Prevent duplicate display of featured images in reader

Introduces FeaturedImageUtils to detect if a post's featured image is already
present within its content. The ReaderPostRenderer now uses this utility
to avoid rendering the featured image at the top of a post if it appears
naturally in the post body, improving content presentation.
