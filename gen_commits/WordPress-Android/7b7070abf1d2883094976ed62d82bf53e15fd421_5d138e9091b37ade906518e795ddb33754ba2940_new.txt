- Wrapped the site URL input and suffix text in a new RelativeLayout.
- Added 'android:textAlignment="viewStart"' and 'android:gravity="start"'
  to title and site URL input fields for proper text alignment.
- Adjusted the leading icon's position in the site URL section.
- Set '.wordpress.com' suffix text to not be focusable.
