refactor: Delegate page list scrolling to ViewModel

Moves the responsibility of finding the scroll position for a specific page and handling cases where the page is not found from PageListFragment to PageListViewModel.

Introduces a `SingleLiveEvent` in PageListViewModel to communicate scroll requests to the PageListFragment. Error handling for a missing page now uses `AppLog.e` instead of a user-facing toast. Consolidates intent handling in PagesActivity into a private method.
