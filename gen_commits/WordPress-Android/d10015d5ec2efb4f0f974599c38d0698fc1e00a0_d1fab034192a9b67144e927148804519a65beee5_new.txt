feat: Show glow animation on My Site for edited posts/pages

Introduce a pulsating glow animation on the "Posts" or "Pages" sections of
the My Site screen. This provides visual feedback when a user
successfully creates or edits a post or page and returns to the dashboard.

Changes include:
- `ActivityLauncher` now starts `EditPostActivity` with `startActivityForResult`.
- `EditPostActivity` returns whether the edited item was a post or a page.
- `MySiteFragment` handles the activity result, triggers the animation,
  and saves/restores the glow state across configuration changes.
- New `View` elements added to `fragment_my_site.xml` for the glow effect.
- Tapping on the glowing section dismisses the animation.
