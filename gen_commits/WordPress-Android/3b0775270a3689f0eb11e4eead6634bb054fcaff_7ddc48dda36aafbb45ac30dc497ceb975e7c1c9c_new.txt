refactor: Move MediaPicker to its own package

Relocates the entire MediaPicker component from `ui.photopicker.mediapicker`
to `ui.mediapicker` for better modularity and organization.
Updates all relevant references, including AndroidManifest, Dagger modules,
and deprecation warnings in the old photopicker classes.
