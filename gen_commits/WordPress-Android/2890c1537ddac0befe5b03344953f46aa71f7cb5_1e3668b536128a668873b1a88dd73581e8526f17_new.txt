feat: Enhance two-step verification footer UI

Separated the two-step verification footer message into a distinct label and a dedicated "Send code via text message" button. This improves clarity and user interaction during sign-in.
Refactored the footer layout from RelativeLayout to LinearLayout to support the new structure.
