fix(notes): Initialize ViewHolder in bindView

The custom newView method was removed, which previously handled
NoteViewHolder creation and tagging. This change ensures that
the ViewHolder is initialized within bindView if it's not already
present, preventing NullPointerExceptions when views are inflated
or recycled by the parent ResourceCursorAdapter.
