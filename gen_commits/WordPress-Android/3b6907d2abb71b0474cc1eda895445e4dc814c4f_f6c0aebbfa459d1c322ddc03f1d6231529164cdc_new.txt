feat(suggestions): Improve empty and loading view states

- Dynamically show/hide the empty view based on active suggestions.
- Display "Loading" initially and "No matching users" when results are empty.
- Refactor `updateEmptyView` to use the adapter's full suggestion list.
- Ensure state updates on data set changes and invalidation.
