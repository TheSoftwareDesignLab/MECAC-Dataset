refactor(quickstart): Streamline completed tasks header layout

Removed nested RelativeLayout in `quick_start_completed_tasks_list_header.xml` to simplify the hierarchy.
Introduced `quick_start_complete_tasks_header_height` dimension and applied it as `minHeight`
to ensure consistent sizing of the header elements.
