feat: Indicate primary domain with a chip in dashboard list

Introduces a visual 'Primary site address' chip to domain entries in the
Domains Dashboard. This helps users quickly identify their primary domain.

The `isPrimary` flag was added to domain models and used to conditionally
display the chip in the PrimaryDomain and SiteDomains view holders.
