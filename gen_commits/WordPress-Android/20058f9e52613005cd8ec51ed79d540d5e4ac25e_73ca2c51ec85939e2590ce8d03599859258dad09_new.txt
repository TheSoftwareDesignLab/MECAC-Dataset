refactor: Simplify activity log progress item layout

Flattened the XML layout by changing the root from FrameLayout to RelativeLayout and removing an unnecessary nested RelativeLayout. This reduces layout depth.
Updated the background to use `?attr/selectableItemBackground` for standard clickable item feedback.
