fix: Adjust MySite row TextView widths and clean up styles

The `MySiteListRowTextView` style was updated to use `match_parent` for width. The `my_site_plan_text_view` was explicitly set to `wrap_content` to override this for its specific layout. Removed redundant `android:textAlignment` and `android:gravity` attributes from `MeListSectionTitleTextView`.
