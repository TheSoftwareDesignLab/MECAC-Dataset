feat(account-closure): Show ineligible dialog for Atomic sites

Introduces a specific dialog (`IneligibleClosureDialog`) for Atomic accounts
when attempting to close an account. This allows for differentiated UI
feedback for users with Atomic sites who may not be able to close their
account through the standard flow.
