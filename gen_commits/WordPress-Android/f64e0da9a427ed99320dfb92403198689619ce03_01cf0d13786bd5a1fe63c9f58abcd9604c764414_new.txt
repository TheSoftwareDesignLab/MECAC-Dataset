feat: Add custom animation for opening notification details

Introduces a custom transition animation when opening a notification from the list view on phones.
The clicked list item animates out by sliding up and fading, while the detail fragment animates in by sliding down from the originating Y position and fading in.
The detail header also includes a subtle overshoot animation for a more dynamic visual effect.
Tablet devices continue to use a standard fade transition.
