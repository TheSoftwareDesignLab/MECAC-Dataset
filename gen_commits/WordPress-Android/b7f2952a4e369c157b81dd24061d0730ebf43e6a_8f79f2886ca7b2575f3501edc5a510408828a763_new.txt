refactor: Use ViewStub for post location settings layout

Extracts the post location settings UI from fragment_edit_post_settings.xml
into a new dedicated layout file, post_location_settings.xml.

The location section is now loaded via a ViewStub, deferring its inflation
until location functionality is actually enabled and displayed.
This improves initial layout performance and promotes modularity.
