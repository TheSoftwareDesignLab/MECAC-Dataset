fix: Wrap Dashboard UI updates in runOnUiThread

Moves calls to `titleBar.stopRotatingRefreshIcon()` and `titleBar.updateCommentBadge()` from
direct execution within `refreshBlogContentTask.onPostExecute()` into a `Runnable`
posted to the UI thread via `runOnUiThread()`.

This ensures these UI operations are explicitly queued and executed on the main thread,
potentially mitigating subtle threading issues or race conditions that could lead
to intermittent UI glitches or crashes during post-execution updates.
