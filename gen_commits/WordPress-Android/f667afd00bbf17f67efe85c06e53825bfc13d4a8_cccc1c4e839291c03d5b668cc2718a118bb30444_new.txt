refactor: Consolidate save button text logic

Extracts duplicated logic for determining the 'Save' button text into a new
private helper method `handleDefaultForSaveButtonText()`. This improves
code readability and maintainability by centralizing the logic previously
present across multiple `switch` cases within `getSaveButtonText()`.
