refactor: Differentiate post publish and update actions

Introduced `MainAction` enum to clearly define the primary action for a post.
Refactored logic to show distinct confirmation dialogs for publishing a new post/draft and updating an already published post.
Renamed `publishPost()` to `uploadPost()` to reflect its broader responsibility across all post statuses.
