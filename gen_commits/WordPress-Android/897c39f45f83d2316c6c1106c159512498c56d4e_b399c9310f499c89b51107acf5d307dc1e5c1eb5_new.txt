perf: Optimize img_promo_stats_widget vector path data

Splits a single large vector path into multiple smaller ones, addressing the
'VectorPath' lint error and improving rendering performance.
Also updates the background color from `blue_200` to `hot_blue_200`
and changes the `tools:ignore` attribute.
