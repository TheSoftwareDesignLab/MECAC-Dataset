feat: Enhance input fields with Material OutlinedBox style

Migrated category name input and a tag input to use `TextInputLayout` with the `OutlinedBox` style. Refactored `add_category.xml` from `RelativeLayout` to `LinearLayout` to accommodate the new input design and improve layout structure. Removed redundant title `MaterialTextViews` as the `TextInputLayout` now provides a floating hint. Replaced hardcoded paddings with dimension resources.
