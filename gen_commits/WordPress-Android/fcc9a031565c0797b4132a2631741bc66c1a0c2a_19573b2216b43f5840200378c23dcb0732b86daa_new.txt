feat: Introduce new 'Use Domain' screen

This commit adds a new 'Use Domain' screen, built with Jetpack Compose, allowing users to select between buying a new domain or connecting an existing domain to a WordPress.com site.

It includes:
- `UseDomainActivity` and `UseDomainScreen` composable.
- UI elements for selecting domain options and displaying relevant information.
- New strings for the screen content.
- Enhances `MainTopAppBar` to support dynamic elevation, utilized by this screen.
