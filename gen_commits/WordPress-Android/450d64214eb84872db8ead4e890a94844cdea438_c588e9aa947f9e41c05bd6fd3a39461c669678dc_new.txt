fix(prefs): Synchronize DetailListPreference with data changes

Ensure the list adapter's content in DetailListPreference accurately
reflects changes in the underlying 'mDetails' array. The 'refreshAdapter'
method now explicitly clears and re-adds items when data size or content
differs, preventing stale UI.

- DetailListAdapter is now initialized with an ArrayList to support dynamic updates.
- Added getItems() to DetailListAdapter for comparing adapter contents with source data.
- Removed selectedIndex field from SavedState for simplification.
