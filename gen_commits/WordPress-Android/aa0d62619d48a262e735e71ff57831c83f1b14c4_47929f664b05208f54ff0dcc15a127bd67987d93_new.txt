feat: Add Block Editor check for Modal Layout Picker visibility

The Modal Layout Picker (MLP) should only be displayed if the Block Editor is enabled for the currently selected site. This change introduces a `canShowModalLayoutPicker()` check to ensure the MLP is only presented when the site is configured to use the Block Editor for new posts, preventing an inappropriate UI flow.
