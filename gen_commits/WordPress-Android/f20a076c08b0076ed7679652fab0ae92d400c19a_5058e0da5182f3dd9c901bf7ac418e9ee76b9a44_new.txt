fix(fluxc): Prevent UserAgent crash on WebView init failure

In some environments, initializing WebView can throw a RuntimeException, leading to an app crash when creating the UserAgent string.
This change wraps the WebView instantiation in a try-catch block, providing a fallback hardcoded User-Agent string to ensure the application continues to function.
