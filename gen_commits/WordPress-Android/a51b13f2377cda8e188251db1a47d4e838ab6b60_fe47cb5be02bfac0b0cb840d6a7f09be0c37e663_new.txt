feat: Build Android APK for translation review builds

The `translation-review-build` job in CircleCI has been completely reworked
to build an actual Android APK using the `android/default` executor.

Key changes include:
- Transition from a Ruby-based placeholder to a full Android build environment.
- Introduction of `translation_review_lang_id` parameter to customize the APK version prefix.
- Integration of Android-specific steps like Gradle caching, Gutenberg submodule checkout, and APK assembly.
- The generated APK is now stored as a build artifact.
