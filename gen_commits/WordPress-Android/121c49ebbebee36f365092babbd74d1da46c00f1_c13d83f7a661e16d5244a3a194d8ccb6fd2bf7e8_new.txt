refactor: Remove DeleteOnly state from local migration flow

The `DeleteOnly` state has been removed from `LocalMigrationState` and the `LocalMigrationOrchestrator`.
The `JetpackMigrationViewModel` now directly manages the display of the 'Delete' UI based on its
`showDeleteState` property, simplifying the migration state machine and improving separation of concerns.
