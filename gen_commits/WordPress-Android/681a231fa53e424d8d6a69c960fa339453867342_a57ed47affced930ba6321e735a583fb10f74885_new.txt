refactor(suggestions): Use explicit param for exit tracking

Refactors `finishWithValue` to use an explicit `withSuggestion`
boolean parameter instead of an implicit check on the `value`
argument. This clarifies the intent of `viewModel.trackExit` calls
and improves code readability, especially when exiting without
selecting a suggestion.
