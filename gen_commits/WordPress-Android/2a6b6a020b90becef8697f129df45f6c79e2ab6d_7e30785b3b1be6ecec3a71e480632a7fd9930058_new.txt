feat: Display upload progress bar on post and page items

Introduces a progress bar to post and page list items in `PostsListAdapter`.
The progress bar becomes visible when a post is detected as uploading or queued.
Currently sets a hardcoded progress value (90%), with a `ToDo` for future integration of actual upload progress from the service.
Includes UI updates in `post_cardview.xml`, `page_item.xml`, and styling in `styles.xml`.
