refactor: Standardize UI backgrounds and spacing

This refactors the application's UI styling. Replaces `.9.png` assets with new XML drawables (`content_bg.xml`, `content_bg_header.xml`) for consistent content block and header backgrounds. Standardizes layout spacing using explicit margins/paddings in layout files and programmatically. Converts `dip` units to `dp` for improved consistency.
