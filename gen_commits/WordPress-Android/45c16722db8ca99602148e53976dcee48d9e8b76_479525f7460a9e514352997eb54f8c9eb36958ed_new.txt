refactor: Remove explicit item animator setup for Reader RecyclerView

The DefaultItemAnimator is the default for RecyclerView. Explicitly instantiating and
setting it, especially when `setSupportsChangeAnimations(true)` is its default
behavior, is redundant. This change simplifies the initialization by relying
on the RecyclerView's default behavior.
