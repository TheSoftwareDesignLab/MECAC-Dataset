refactor(activity-card): Simplify item layout hierarchy

Removes an unnecessary nested ConstraintLayout from `my_site_activity_card_item.xml`.
The text views are now directly constrained within the root ConstraintLayout,
simplifying the layout hierarchy and potentially improving rendering performance.
