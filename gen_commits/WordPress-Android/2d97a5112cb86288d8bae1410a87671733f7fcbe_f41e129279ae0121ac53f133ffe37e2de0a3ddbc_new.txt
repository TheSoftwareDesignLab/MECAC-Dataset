refactor: Simplify post list buttons visibility and interaction

Removes the `ObjectAnimator` based animation for toggling between button rows
in the posts list. The `post_cardview.xml` layout is flattened, removing
nested `LinearLayout`s for button rows. Button visibility is now toggled
directly via `View.GONE` and `View.VISIBLE` when the "more" or "back"
buttons are tapped, simplifying the interaction logic.
