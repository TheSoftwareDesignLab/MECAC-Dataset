fix: Fallback custom font loading on Android N and older

Implement a fallback to `FontFamily.Serif` for the `EBGaramond` font
on Android 7 (Nougat) and earlier versions. This addresses an issue
where custom font loading can fail on older devices (e.g., Huawei
running Android 7), leading to incorrect text rendering.
