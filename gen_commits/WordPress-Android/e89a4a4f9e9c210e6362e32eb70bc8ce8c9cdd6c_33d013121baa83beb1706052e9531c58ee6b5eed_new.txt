feat: Enhance passcode activities with Sherlock Action Bar

Integrates Action Bar Sherlock into passcode management activities
(PasscodePreferencesActivity, PasscodeUnlockActivity, PasscodeManagePasswordActivity).
This migration to SherlockFragmentActivity provides a modern UI and
standardizes the user experience across these screens.

- Locks all passcode activities to portrait orientation.
- Sets windowSoftInputMode to `stateHidden` for consistent keyboard behavior.
- Adds an Action Bar title to PasscodePreferencesActivity.
- Updates the background color of the passcode preferences layout.
