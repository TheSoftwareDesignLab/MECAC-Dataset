feat: Add page title and template to new page creation flow

Enhances the new page creation and preview flow to support passing a
specific page title and a selected layout template.

Key changes include:
* Updating ActivityLauncher methods to accept 'title' and 'template'.
* Modifying EditPostActivity to receive and apply these new extras,
  especially pre-filling the title for Gutenberg editor, and logging
  template selection.
* Updating ModalLayoutPickerViewModel to emit PageRequest objects
  containing title, content, and template.
* Adjusting analytics tracking in EditPostActivity and PostEditorAnalyticsSession
  to correctly differentiate between actual page creation/editing and template
  preview, suppressing some events during preview mode.
