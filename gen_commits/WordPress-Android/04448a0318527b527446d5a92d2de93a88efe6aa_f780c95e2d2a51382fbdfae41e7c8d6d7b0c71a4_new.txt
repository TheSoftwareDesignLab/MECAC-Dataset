feat: Activate comment batch moderation UI and confirmation dialogs

The previously commented-out logic for displaying the comment batch moderation UI has been enabled.
This change activates the Contextual Action Bar (CAB) when multiple comments are selected, allowing users to perform bulk moderation actions. Additionally, confirmation dialogs for 'delete' and 'trash' actions are now shown.
