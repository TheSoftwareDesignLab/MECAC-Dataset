refactor: Use RelativeLayout for main action list item

Converted `main_action_list_item.xml` from `LinearLayout` to `RelativeLayout` for improved layout flexibility.
This involved updating layout attributes in the XML and associated styles (`MainBottomSheetRowIcon`, `MainBottomSheetRowTextView`). Also replaced `TextView` with `MaterialTextView`.
