fix: Use getChildAdapterPosition for smooth scrolling

Using getChildAdapterPosition ensures the current item's position
is retrieved from the adapter's data set, providing a more reliable
reference for distance calculations compared to getChildLayoutPosition,
which can diverge in certain RecyclerView states (e.g., filtering).
