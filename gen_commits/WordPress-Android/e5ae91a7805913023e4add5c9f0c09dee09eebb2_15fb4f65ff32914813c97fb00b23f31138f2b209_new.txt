refactor: Redefine Theme model; rename old to Theme2

The `Theme.java` class has been rewritten with a simplified structure,
parsing a new set of JSON fields (id, author, screenshot, etc.).
The previous, more complex Theme model has been moved to `Theme2.java`
to maintain existing functionality that relies on its original schema.
