feat: Extract no sites view and add account settings

Refactors the My Site fragment's empty state view into a dedicated `my_site_fragment_no_sites_view.xml`. This new layout includes the previous actionable empty view and introduces a new section displaying the user's avatar, display name, and a link to account settings.
