feat: Implement side navigation menu drawer

Integrates the `android-menudrawer` library to provide a consistent side navigation experience across major application activities. This replaces previous top-level navigation with a sliding drawer, accessible via the action bar home button.

Key changes include:
- Addition of the `android-menudrawer` library dependency.
- New layout (`menu_drawer.xml`) and associated styles and drawables for the drawer.
- Integration into the `WPActionBarActivity` base class, with `createMenuDrawer` replacing `setContentView` in `Dashboard`, `Posts`, `Comments`, `Settings`, and `ViewWebStats`.
- Dynamic visibility for the Reader menu item based on the current blog type.
- Handling of `android.R.id.home` to toggle the drawer.
