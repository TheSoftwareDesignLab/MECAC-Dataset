feat: PhotoPicker: Dynamically hide edit button for videos

Ensures the 'Edit' button in the PhotoPicker's insert/edit bar is only visible when an image is selected, as editing is not applicable to videos. The UI now reacts dynamically to the type of the selected item, showing or hiding the edit option accordingly. The video status of the selected item is also persisted across state changes.
