fix: Prevent NPE when editor theme is not initialized

Adds a null check for `editorTheme` before accessing its properties. This prevents a potential NullPointerException if `getEditorThemeForSite` returns null, which can happen before the theme is initialized (e.g., on first app run).
When `editorTheme` is null, the `unstableGalleryWithImageBlocks` analytics property will not be reported.
