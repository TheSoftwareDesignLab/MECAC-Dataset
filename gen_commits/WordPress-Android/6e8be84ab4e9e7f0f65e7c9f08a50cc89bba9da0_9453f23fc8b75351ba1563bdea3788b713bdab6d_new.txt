feat: Add search-specific layout update to ActionableEmptyView

Introduce `updateLayoutForSearch` to dynamically adjust the view's
layout parameters, including top margin and visibility of the image and
button, based on whether the view is used in a search context. This
enables a distinct empty state UI tailored for search results.
