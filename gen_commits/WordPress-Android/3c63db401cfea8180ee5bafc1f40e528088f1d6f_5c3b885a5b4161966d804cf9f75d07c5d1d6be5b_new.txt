fix: Prevent image removal on Android API 19 and below

The `setFocusAfterElement` call, used after tapping an image, caused the image
to be unexpectedly removed on Android API levels 19 and below. This change
conditionally applies the focus adjustment only for API levels above 19,
resolving the removal issue while maintaining the fix for unwanted scrolling
on newer devices when the keyboard appears.
