refactor: Improve Reader mshot image viewer launch and UI

- Refines ReaderActivityLauncher photo viewer API by removing an overloaded method and adding a context null check.
- Enhances ReaderBlogInfoView to pass the source view and its coordinates when launching the photo viewer for mshot images, enabling better visual transitions.
- Removes a redundant mMshotWidth field from ReaderBlogInfoView.
- Updates reader_blog_info_view.xml to allow blog names on two lines, improve follower count text display, and adjust mshot image margin.
