refactor: Decouple Quick Start focus point logic from views

The `addOrRemoveQuickStartFocusPoint` method was refactored to use
`QuickStartMySitePrompts` for retrieving parent and target view IDs.
This makes the focus point display logic more generic and extensible
for various quick start tasks at the activity level in WPMainActivity.
