refactor: Rename comment author UI elements and refactor date styles

Renamed `text_comment_title` to `text_comment_author` across layouts, styles, and adapter code to improve semantic correctness. The field displays the comment's author.
Updated the `ReaderTextView.Comment.Title` style to `ReaderTextView.Comment.Author` and adjusted its text color.
Removed the deprecated `ReaderTextView.Source` and `ReaderTextView.Source.Large` styles.
Introduced `ReaderTextView.Date.Large` for displaying dates, providing a more specific and organized style definition, which is now used in `comment_detail_fragment.xml`.
