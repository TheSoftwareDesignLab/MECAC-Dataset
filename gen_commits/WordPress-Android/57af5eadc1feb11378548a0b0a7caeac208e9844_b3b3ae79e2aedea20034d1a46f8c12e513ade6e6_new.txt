refactor: Remove TabLayout from FilteredRecyclerView

This commit removes the `TabLayout` filtering option from `FilteredRecyclerView`, along with all related code, XML layouts, and API calls. The `FilteredRecyclerView` will now exclusively use a `Spinner` for filter selection, simplifying the component and removing an unused UI alternative.
