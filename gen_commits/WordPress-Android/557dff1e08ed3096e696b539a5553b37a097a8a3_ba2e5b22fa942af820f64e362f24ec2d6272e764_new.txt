fix: Prevent premature return in Reader post list onDataLoaded

The previous logic in onDataLoaded could prematurely exit when new, non-empty data was received, due to checking mHasUpdatedPosts independently of isEmpty. This change ensures that the fragment proceeds with UI updates when data is not empty, even if mHasUpdatedPosts is false.

Also removes redundant parentheses in a conditional.
