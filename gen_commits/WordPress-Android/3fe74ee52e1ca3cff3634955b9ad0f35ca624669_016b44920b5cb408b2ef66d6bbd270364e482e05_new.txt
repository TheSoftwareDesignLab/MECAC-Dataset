feat: Show user avatar and name in My Site empty state

Display the current user's Gravatar and account name in the "No Sites" empty state of the My Site fragment. Tapping the user avatar now navigates to Account Settings.

Includes refactoring `actionableEmptyView` into a new `noSitesView` binding.
