refactor: ReaderPhotoView to use XML layout for components

Refactors the `ReaderPhotoView` custom component to inflate its child views (image, progress bar, error text) from an XML layout file (`reader_photo_view.xml`) instead of creating and configuring them programmatically in Java.

This change improves readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns by moving UI layout definition from code to XML.
