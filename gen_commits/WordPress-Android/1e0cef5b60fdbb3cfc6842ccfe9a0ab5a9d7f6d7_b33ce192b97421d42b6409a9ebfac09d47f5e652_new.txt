refactor: Extract single stats activity block layout

The RecyclerView displaying activity items and its corresponding label TextView were extracted into a new reusable layout `stats_block_single_activity.xml`. The main `stats_block_activity_item.xml` now includes this layout, and `ActivityViewHolder` is updated to reflect these changes.
