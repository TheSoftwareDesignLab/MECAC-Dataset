refactor: Introduce dedicated ThemeModel constructors

Refactor ThemeModel to provide specific constructors for creating WP.com and Jetpack theme instances. This improves object creation by enforcing required fields at instantiation time, reducing reliance on setters for initial setup.

The no-argument constructor is deprecated, and ThemeRestClient has been updated to use the new type-specific constructors.
