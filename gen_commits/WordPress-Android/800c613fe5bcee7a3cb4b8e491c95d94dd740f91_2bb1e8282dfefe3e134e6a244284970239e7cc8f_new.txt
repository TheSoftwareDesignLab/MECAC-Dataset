feat: Enhance site creation result states and domain checkout

Refactor `SiteCreationResult` by introducing a `Created` sealed interface.
`NotInLocalDb` is now a variant of `Created`.
Add a new `Created.InCart` state to represent sites created but pending domain registration purchase.

Update site creation and domain checkout flows to leverage these new states:
- Improve `onCheckoutResult` handling, including a check for null events.
- Enhance `SiteCreationProgressViewModel` to detect and reuse existing `InCart` sites when returning to the progress screen.

Rename `DomainRegistered` to `DomainRegistrationPurchased` for clarity.
