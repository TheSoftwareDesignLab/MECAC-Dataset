fix: Disable swipe-to-refresh during pages pager interaction

Prevents the swipe-to-refresh mechanism from triggering when a user is interacting with (e.g., swiping horizontally on) the pages pager. The swipe-to-refresh helper is temporarily disabled on touch down and re-enabled on touch up to avoid accidental refreshes.
