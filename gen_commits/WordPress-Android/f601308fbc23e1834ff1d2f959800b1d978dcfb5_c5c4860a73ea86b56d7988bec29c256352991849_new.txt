refactor: Centralize and abstract layout retrieval

Introduces a `getLayout` helper method in `LayoutPickerViewModel` to
standardize fetching layouts by slug. This allows subclasses,
specifically `ModalLayoutPickerViewModel`, to override the default
behavior and retrieve layouts from a specialized source (e.g., `siteStore`).
All existing direct lookups via `layouts.firstOrNull` are replaced
with calls to the new `getLayout` method.
