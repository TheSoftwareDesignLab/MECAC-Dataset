refactor(coroutines): Deprecate ThreadModule scopes and constants

Deprecate `UI_SCOPE`, `DEFAULT_SCOPE` constants and `provideBackgroundScope` function. This encourages implementing `CoroutineScope` directly within components (e.g., ViewModels, Activities) to manage coroutine lifecycles more effectively, ensuring coroutines are cancelled in `onCleared` or `onDestroy`.
