refactor: Streamline Stats list item navigation

Introduces a `NavigationAction` wrapper to centralize click and navigation events for Stats list items. This improves consistency and testability by dispatching `NavigationTarget` events via a `MutableLiveData`.

- Adds `NavigationTarget.ViewPost` for direct post viewing.
- Updates `NavigationTarget.ViewPostDetailStats` to use `postId: Long` directly.
- Replaces direct lambda callbacks with `NavigationAction` in `BlockListItem` and its consumers.
