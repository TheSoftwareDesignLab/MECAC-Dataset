fix: Apply blur effect conditionally on login screen

The `blur` modifier is only supported on Android 12 (API 31/S) and above.
This change applies the blur effect only on supported API levels. For older
Android versions, an `alpha(0.5f)` fallback is used to maintain visual clarity
and ensure buttons remain distinct.
