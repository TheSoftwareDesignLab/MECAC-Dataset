refactor: Standardize UI dimensions and improve code style

Replaced hardcoded dimensions with `@dimen` resources in media layouts for
consistency and maintainability. Also applied minor code style improvements
by making a `ViewHolder` instantiation more concise and adding braces to
single-line `if`/`else` blocks.
