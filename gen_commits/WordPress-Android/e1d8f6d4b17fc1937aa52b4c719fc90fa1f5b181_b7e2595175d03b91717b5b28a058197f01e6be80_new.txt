fix: Improve state management for WPLoginInputRow

The `WPLoginInputRow` component faced challenges with retaining its state, particularly when multiple instances were used in a single layout. The previous approach involved dynamically reassigning view IDs to mitigate conflicts, which was complex and prone to issues.

This commit refactors the state management by:
- Disabling the default automatic state saving for child views within `WPLoginInputRow`.
- Implementing a custom `SavedState` mechanism to explicitly save and restore the internal `EditText`'s state.
- Removing the problematic ID re-assignment logic.

This ensures robust state preservation for all `WPLoginInputRow` instances across configuration changes.

Additionally, a right padding has been added to the `TextInputLayout` within the component's layout to improve visual alignment.
