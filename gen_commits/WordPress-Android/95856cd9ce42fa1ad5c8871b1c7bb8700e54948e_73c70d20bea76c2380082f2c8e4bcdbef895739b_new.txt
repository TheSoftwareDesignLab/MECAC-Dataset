perf: Optimize notification loading and list updates

Moves parsing of cached notifications to a background AsyncTask to
prevent UI freezes when loading existing notes.

Optimizes bulk additions to the notifications list by disabling
`notifyOnChange` during the `addAll` operation, reducing redundant
UI updates.

Includes minor comment clarification in GCMIntentService.
