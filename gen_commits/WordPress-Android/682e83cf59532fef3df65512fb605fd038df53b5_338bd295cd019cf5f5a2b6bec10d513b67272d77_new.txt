refactor: Split comment scrolling into distinct methods

The `scrollToCommentIdWithSmooth` method, which used a boolean parameter to control
smoothness, has been refactored into two distinct methods:
- `scrollToCommentId` for instant scrolling
- `smoothScrollToCommentId` for animated scrolling

This improves clarity and readability by providing explicit method names for
each type of scroll behavior.
