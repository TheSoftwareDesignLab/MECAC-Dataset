ci: Automate string export for translation during release

Introduces a new private Fastlane lane `send_strings_for_translation`.
This lane copies the main app's `strings.xml` to a dedicated
`fastlane/resources/values/` directory, commits this change, and pushes it.
This ensures the latest strings are available for translation platforms
as part of the release automation flow.
