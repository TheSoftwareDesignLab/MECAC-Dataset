style: Update text appearances in domain layouts

This commit migrates text styles in various domain-related layout files:
- Replaced `TextAppearance.AppCompat.Title` with `?attr/textAppearanceSubtitle1` for site address and domain display.
- Updated `TextAppearance.App.CollapsingToolbar.Expanded` to `BloggingRemindersText.Title` for the domain purchase title.
- Changed `?attr/textAppearanceHeadline6` to `?attr/textAppearanceSubtitle2` for the site domains header.
These changes standardize styling, moving towards Material Design attributes and unified custom styles.
