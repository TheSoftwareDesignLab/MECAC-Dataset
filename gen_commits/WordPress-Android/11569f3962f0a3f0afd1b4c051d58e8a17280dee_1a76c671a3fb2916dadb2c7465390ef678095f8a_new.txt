refactor: Decouple OAuth and WebAuthn authentication responses

Introduces `OauthResponse` interface and concrete `Token` and
`WebauthnResponse` classes to distinguish between standard OAuth tokens
and WebAuthn challenge data returned by the authentication endpoint.

This improves type safety and clarity by separating the handling of
these distinct response formats, which were previously conflated
within the `Token` class. The `Authenticator` now parses responses
into the appropriate type, and `AccountStore` handles them accordingly.
