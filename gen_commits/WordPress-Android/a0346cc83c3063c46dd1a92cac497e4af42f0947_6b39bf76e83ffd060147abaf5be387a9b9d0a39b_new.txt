refactor: Add nullability annotations to ThemeModel and related methods

Introduces `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` annotations to `ThemeModel` fields,
getters, and setters for improved null safety and static analysis.
Updates related methods in `ThemeRestClient`, `ThemeSqlUtils`, and `ThemeStore`
to reflect these nullability guarantees, removing redundant null checks
where appropriate. Adds `@SuppressWarnings` for uninitialized non-null fields.
