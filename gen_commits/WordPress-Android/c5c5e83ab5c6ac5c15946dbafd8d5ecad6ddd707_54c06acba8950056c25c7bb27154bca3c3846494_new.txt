feat: Add FluxC actions and events for themes

Introduces a new `ThemeAction` enum to define actions for fetching
different types of themes (WordPress, installed, purchased, and current).
Adds `OnCurrentThemeFetched` event to `ThemeStore` to notify listeners
when the current theme for a site has been successfully retrieved.
