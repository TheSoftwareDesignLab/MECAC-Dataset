refactor(fluxc): Make theme deletion site-specific

Refactored `ThemeSqlUtils.removeTheme` to `removeSiteTheme` to ensure themes are deleted based on a `SiteModel` and the theme's remote ID, instead of its local database ID. This provides more accurate deletion logic. Updated `ThemeStore` calls to reflect this change.
