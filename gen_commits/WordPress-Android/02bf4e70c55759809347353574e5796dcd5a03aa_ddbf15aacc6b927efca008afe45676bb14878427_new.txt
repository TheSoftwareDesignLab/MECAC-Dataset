feat: Improve Insights Management layout for wider screens

Introduces adaptive styling for the Insights Management fragment.
Extracts layout width and gravity properties into the `StatsInsightManagementList` style.
This ensures the content is centered and width-constrained on larger screen sizes
(e.g., 528dp and 720dp), enhancing tablet UI presentation.
