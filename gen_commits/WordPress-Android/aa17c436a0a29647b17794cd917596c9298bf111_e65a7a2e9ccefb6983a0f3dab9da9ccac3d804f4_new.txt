fix: Improve DetailListPreference layout and visibility

Ensure detail text is hidden when it is empty.
Adjust the layout of `DetailListPreference` to vertically center the main text and detail text alongside the radio button.
Remove the unused `loadLocalCategories` method from `SiteSettingsModel`.
Remove redundant detail array initialization in `SiteSettingsFragment` as it's no longer necessary.
