refactor: Make NotificationsLinkHandler conform to DeepLinkHandler

The NotificationsLinkHandler now implements the DeepLinkHandler interface.
This change involved:
- Renaming `isNotificationsUrl` to `shouldHandleUrl`.
- Modifying `buildNavigateAction` to accept a `UriWrapper` parameter.
- Adding the `stripUrl` method for consistent deep link handling.
- Updating `DeepLinkingIntentReceiverViewModel` and associated tests to reflect these API changes.
