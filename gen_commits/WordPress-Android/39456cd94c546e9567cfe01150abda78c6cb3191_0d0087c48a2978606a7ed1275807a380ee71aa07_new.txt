fix: Use state info color for auto-upload eligible post failures

Reclassifies posts with `UploadFailed` status that are `isEligibleForAutoUpload` from
`isProgressInfo` to `isStateInfo`. This ensures the status label
displays `STATE_INFO_COLOR` instead of `PROGRESS_INFO_COLOR`,
aligning with the semantic meaning of a post waiting for an automatic retry.
Updated corresponding test to reflect this change.
