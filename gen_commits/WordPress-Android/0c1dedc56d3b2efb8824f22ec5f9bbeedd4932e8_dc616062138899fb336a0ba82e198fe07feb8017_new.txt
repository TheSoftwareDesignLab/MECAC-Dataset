refactor(e2e): Improve ReaderViewPage element selectors and stability

Extracts UI resource IDs into constants for better maintainability.
Adds a wait for the "Swipe for more" overlay to disappear before
tapping the like button, enhancing test reliability.
Also renames mLikeCountSelector to mLikeCount for clarity.
