feat: Bidirectional scrolling for AutoScrollingLazyColumn

Enables the AutoScrollingLazyColumn to scroll items in both upward and
downward directions.

This is achieved by making the `scrollBy` parameter determine the scroll
direction. The `itemsListState` initialization, `reverseLayout` property,
and scroll offset calculations are now conditional based on the `scrollBy`
value.

The redundant `.reversed()` call in `LargeTexts.kt` was removed as the
AutoScrollingLazyColumn now handles conditional list reversal internally.
