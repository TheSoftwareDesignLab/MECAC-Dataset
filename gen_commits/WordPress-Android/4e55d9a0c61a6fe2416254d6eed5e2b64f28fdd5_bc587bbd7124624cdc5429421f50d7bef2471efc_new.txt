fix: Add null-safety for themes list in ThemeStore

Explicitly mark `themes` list in `FetchedSiteThemesPayload` as `@Nullable`.
Added a null check in `handleInstalledThemesFetched` to prevent
`NullPointerException` if `payload.themes` is null, logging a
warning instead of attempting to save null data.
Also added `@NonNull` annotations for `SiteModel` and `ThemeAction`
fields and constructor parameters.
