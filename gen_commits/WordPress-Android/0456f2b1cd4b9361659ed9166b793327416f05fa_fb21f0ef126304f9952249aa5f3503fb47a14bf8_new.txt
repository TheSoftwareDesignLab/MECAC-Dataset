refactor: Simplify layout attribute definitions

Removed redundant `android:layout_below` attributes from `location_wrapper` and `post` elements in `edit.xml` for large screen configurations.
Removed `android:layout_weight` from the `mainRL` element in `viewposts.xml`.
These attributes were likely no longer necessary and simplifying the layout structure.
