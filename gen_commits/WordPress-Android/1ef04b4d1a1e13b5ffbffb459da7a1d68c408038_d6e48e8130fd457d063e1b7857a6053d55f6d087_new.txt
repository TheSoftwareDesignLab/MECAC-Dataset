refactor(stats): Rework all-time insights item layout

Rewrites the `stats_insights_all_time_item.xml` layout to use a `LinearLayout`-based
grid structure instead of `RelativeLayout`s.

This improves:
- Visual clarity and alignment of stat items.
- Readability and maintainability of the layout code.
- Adds appropriate padding and updated text styling.
