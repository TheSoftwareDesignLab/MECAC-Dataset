feat: Update email login prompt based on signup availability

Adjusts the email login screen prompt to dynamically reflect whether
account creation (signup) is currently enabled from the login flow.
A new string resource is introduced for when signup is disabled,
ensuring the prompt accurately guides the user to log in without
offering a non-existent signup option.
