refactor(mlp): Migrate Modal Layout Picker to CoordinatorLayout

Migrates the Modal Layout Picker (MLP) UI from a custom RecyclerView setup with an ItemDecoration for sticky categories to a standard Android CoordinatorLayout, AppBarLayout, and CollapsingToolbarLayout architecture.

This refactoring:
- Replaces a single ModalLayoutPickerAdapter with dedicated CategoriesAdapter and LayoutCategoryAdapter.
- Integrates category buttons and initial header/title into the AppBarLayout for native collapsing and sticky behavior.
- Simplifies the ModalLayoutPickerViewModel by removing UI-specific logic related to header visibility and landscape mode.
- Improves overall UI structure and maintainability by adopting standard components.
