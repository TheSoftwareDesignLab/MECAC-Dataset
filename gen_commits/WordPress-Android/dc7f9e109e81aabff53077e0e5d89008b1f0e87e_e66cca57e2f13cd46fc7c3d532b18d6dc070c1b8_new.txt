feat: Use /themes/mine endpoint for current theme

Updates the current theme fetching logic to use the `sites/%s/themes/mine` API endpoint.
This involved:
- Modifying `RestClientUtils` to use the new path for `getCurrentTheme`.
- Introducing `Theme.fromJSONV1_1` to parse the updated JSON response structure, which differs in keys like `preview_url` and price extraction.
- Updating `ThemeBrowserActivity` to use the `V1_1` client and the new parsing method.
