refactor: Standardize notification XML layouts with theme resources

Replaced hardcoded dimensions (dp/sp) and hex colors with `@dimen` and `@color` resources across notification layouts for consistency and maintainability.
Also updated `fill_parent` to `match_parent` and adjusted layout_height with layout_weight for better responsiveness.
Includes minor code refactors: reordered `updateTitle()` call in `ReaderUserListActivity` and updated javadoc/type usage in `ReaderUserAdapter`.
