refactor: Convert showPostInWebView to accept Fragment param

The showPostInWebView function was refactored from an extension function
to a regular private function that explicitly takes a Fragment instance.
This ensures the correct Fragment context is passed to
PrivateAtCookieRefreshProgressDialog.showIfNecessary.
