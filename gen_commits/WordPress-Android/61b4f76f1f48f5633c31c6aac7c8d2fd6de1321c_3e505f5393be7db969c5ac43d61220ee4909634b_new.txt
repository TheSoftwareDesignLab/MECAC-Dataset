refactor(notifications): Simplify swipe to navigate hint

The swipe to navigate hint in the notification detail view has been simplified.
Removed the "OKAY" action button from the Snackbar, along with the associated analytics event.
The hint is now marked as shown and dismissed when the user actually performs a page swipe.
The Snackbar message string has also been slightly updated.
