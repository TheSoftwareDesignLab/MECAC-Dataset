refactor: Remove redundant mGridManager property

The `PhotoPickerFragment` no longer requires a dedicated `mGridManager` property to hold the `GridLayoutManager` instance.
The layout manager is now directly accessed via `recycler.layoutManager`, simplifying the fragment's state and improving code readability.
