- Integrate HomePagePickerViewModel with SiteCreationActivity for state management and action handling.
- Enable passing selected site design and segment ID from the picker to the site creation flow.
- Refactor HomePagePickerFragment to delegate state persistence to its ViewModel.
- Update UI for layout selection: use MaterialCardView stroke for selected items and a simpler checkmark icon.
- Adjust segmentId to be nullable in domain selection to support skipped design choices.
- Pass the chosen siteDesign to the CreateSiteUseCase.
- Update FluxC dependency.
