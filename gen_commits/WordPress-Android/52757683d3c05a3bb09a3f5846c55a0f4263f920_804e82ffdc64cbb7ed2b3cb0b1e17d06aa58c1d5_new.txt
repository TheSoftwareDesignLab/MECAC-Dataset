refactor: Add site/theme context to ActivateThemePayload errors

Ensure ActivateThemePayload always includes the SiteModel and ThemeModel, even in error states.
Previously, error payloads only contained the error, lacking context about the failed activation's site and theme.
This provides more informative error handling.
