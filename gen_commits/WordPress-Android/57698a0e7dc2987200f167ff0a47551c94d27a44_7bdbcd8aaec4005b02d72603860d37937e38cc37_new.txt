test: Remove Robolectric from EditorAsyncMediaTest

Converts EditorAsyncMediaTest to a plain JVM unit test by removing its
Robolectric dependency.

A minimal `android.text.TextUtils` stub is added to the test source
directory, providing the `isEmpty()` method required by the test. This
eliminates the need for the full Android framework or mocks, simplifying
the test setup and potentially improving test execution speed.
