refactor: Unify Jetpack Backup and Restore layout files

Consolidate various XML layouts used for Jetpack Backup download and Restore features into a set of shared, generically named layouts (e.g., `jetpack_backup_restore_activity.xml`, `jetpack_backup_restore_fragment.xml`). This refactoring reduces UI code duplication and simplifies maintenance by standardizing common visual structures across these related screens. All corresponding Kotlin files have been updated to reference these new, unified layout resources.
