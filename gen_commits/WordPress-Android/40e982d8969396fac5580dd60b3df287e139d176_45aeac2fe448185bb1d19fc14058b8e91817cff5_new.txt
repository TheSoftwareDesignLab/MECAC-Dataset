feat(compose): Add LargeText composable

Introduces a new `@Composable` function, `LargeText`, to display a single
text string with a predefined large style. This component ensures
consistent styling for prominent text elements, utilizing a 42.sp font size,
semi-bold weight, and specific letter/line spacing.
