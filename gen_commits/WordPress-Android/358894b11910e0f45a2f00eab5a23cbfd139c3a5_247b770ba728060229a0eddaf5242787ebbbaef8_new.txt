feat(reader): Redesign author and blog imagery display

Reworks the layout for author and blog avatars in Reader posts.
Moves to ConstraintLayout for precise positioning, allowing the author's
avatar to be offset from the blog's blavatar/site image.
Introduces a new drawable and color for the author avatar's border.
Also refines the avatar display logic to ensure an author avatar is
only shown and loaded if a valid URL is provided.
