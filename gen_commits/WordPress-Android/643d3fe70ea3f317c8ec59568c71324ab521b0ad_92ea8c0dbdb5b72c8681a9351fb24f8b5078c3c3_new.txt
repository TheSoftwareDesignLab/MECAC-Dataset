feat: Add large-tvdpi screen resource definitions

Adds new `dimens.xml` and `styles.xml` for `res/values-large-tvdpi` to
provide specific layout and text sizes for this screen configuration.

Improves error handling in `EditPost.java` by displaying a user-friendly
toast message and finishing the activity when the current blog cannot be found,
instead of just printing the stack trace.
