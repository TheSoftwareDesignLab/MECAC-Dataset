refactor: Introduce PopulatedList UI state for domains

Refactors the `UiState` in `DomainManagementViewModel` to better handle the loading state
of the domain list.

The `PopulatedList` sealed class is introduced, allowing `MyDomainsScreen` to differentiate
between an initial loading state and a state where domains are fully loaded. This enables
displaying placeholder cards while data is fetched, improving user experience.
