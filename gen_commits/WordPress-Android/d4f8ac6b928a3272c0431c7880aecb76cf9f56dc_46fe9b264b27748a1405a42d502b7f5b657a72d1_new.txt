fix: Hide comment options menu when no comment is active

The comment options menu is now hidden by default in the layout and its
visibility is explicitly controlled in the fragment. It will only be shown
when a `WordPress.currentComment` object is present, preventing the menu
from appearing out of context.

Additionally, corrected text size units from `dp` to `sp` for all buttons
within the comment options menu to ensure proper scaling with user font
preferences.
