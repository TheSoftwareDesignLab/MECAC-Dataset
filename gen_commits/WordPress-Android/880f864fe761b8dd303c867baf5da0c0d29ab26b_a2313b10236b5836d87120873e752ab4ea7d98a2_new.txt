refactor: Migrate layouts to swXXXdp for improved tablet support

- Migrates layout resources from legacy qualifiers (e.g., `large-mdpi`) to standard `sw600dp` and `sw720dp` for better screen size adaptation.
- Refactors Media Browser fragments to manage their own options menus and enhances `MediaGridFragment` with dynamic column counts.
- Adjusts layout dimensions, weights, and text sizes across various media and theme detail fragments.
- Cleans up menu items in `media_details.xml` and `media_edit.xml` and adds `isXHDPI` utility method.
- Includes minor fixes for `ThemeBrowserActivity` (NPE) and `MediaBrowserActivity` backstack handling.
