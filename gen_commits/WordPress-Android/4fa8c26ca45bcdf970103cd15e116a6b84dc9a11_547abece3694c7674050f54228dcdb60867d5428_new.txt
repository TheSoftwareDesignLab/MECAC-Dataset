feat: Reader: Enable edge-to-edge mode for post pager on Android 33+

The ReaderPostPagerActivity now utilizes the full screen by enabling edge-to-edge
display on Android 33 (Tiramisu) and newer, providing a more immersive reading
experience.

This was implemented by:
- Removing the `NoEdgeToEdge` theme override from the activity's manifest.
- Adding explicit full-screen logic in `onCreateView` for Android 33+, which
  sets `setDecorFitsSystemWindows(false)` and hides system bars.
- Excluding the activity from the global `excludedActivities` list in
  `BaseAppCompatActivity` as it now manages its own edge-to-edge behavior.
- Refactoring `reader_activity_post_pager.xml` to use ConstraintLayout to
  accommodate the new layout behavior.
