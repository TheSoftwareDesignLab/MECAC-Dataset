test: Refactor stats button click in screenshot test

Update `moveToStats` to click the stats button using `onView(withText(R.string.stats))`
instead of a specific view ID. This improves test robustness by targeting
elements based on visible text, making it less prone to failures from UI
changes that might alter view IDs.
