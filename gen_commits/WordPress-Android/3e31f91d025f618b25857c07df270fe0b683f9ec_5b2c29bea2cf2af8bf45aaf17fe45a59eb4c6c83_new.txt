refactor: Extract common button setup logic in WPDialogSnackbar

The `setNegativeButton`, `setNeutralButton`, and `setPositiveButton` methods in `WPDialogSnackbar` contained duplicated logic for handling button visibility, text, and click listeners.
This common logic has been extracted into a new private helper method `setButtonTextAndVisibility` to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
