feat: Add specific splash screen layout and UI adjustments

Introduced a new splash screen layout in `res/layout-large-notlong-port-hdpi-finger-keyssoft-qwerty-trackball-800x480/splashscreen.xml` to support specific large device configurations.

Refined existing UI elements:
*   Adjusted the default splash screen logo position by applying a negative top margin for better centering.
*   Updated avatar padding from `3px` to `4dip` in the comment row item (`res/layout/row.xml`) for improved density independence.
*   Adjusted vertical margins for various text fields (e.g., name, email, post title, comment) in the comment row item to optimize spacing.
