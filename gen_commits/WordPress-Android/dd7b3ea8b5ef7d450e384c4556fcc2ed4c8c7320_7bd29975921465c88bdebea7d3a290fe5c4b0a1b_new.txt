refactor: Simplify Reader post UI visibility management

Remove `ConstraintLayout.Group` for `frame_photo` and convert `layout_discover` from a `Group` to a standard `View`. This refactors how view visibility is managed within `ReaderPostViewHolder`, eliminating unnecessary `ConstraintLayout.Group` components and updating the visibility logic accordingly, specifically adding explicit control for `image_discover_avatar`.
