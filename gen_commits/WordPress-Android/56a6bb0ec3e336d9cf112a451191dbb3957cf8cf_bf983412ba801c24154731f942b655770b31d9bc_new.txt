fix(reader): Remove incorrect follow button selected state

The 'selected' state of the follow comments button was previously set based on whether the button was enabled or in a loading state. This was incorrect, as the selected state should reflect the actual follow status (e.g., actively following comments), not its current interactability or loading indicator.

This change ensures the button's selection state is no longer implicitly tied to its enabled/loading status, allowing its true follow state to be managed separately.

Also removes redundant casting for `findViewById` calls.
