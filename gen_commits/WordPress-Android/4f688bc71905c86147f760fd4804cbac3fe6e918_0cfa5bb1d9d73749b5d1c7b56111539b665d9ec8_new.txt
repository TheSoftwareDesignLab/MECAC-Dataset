feat: Conditionally display Quick Start focus points

Introduce logic to conditionally display focus points on Quick Actions and Quick Link Ribbon cards within My Site. Focus points are enabled based on the `defaultABExperimentTab` setting, allowing for A/B testing variations:
- Quick Actions card focus points are shown when the `defaultABExperimentTab` is not `DASHBOARD`.
- Quick Link Ribbon card focus points are shown when the `defaultABExperimentTab` is `DASHBOARD`.
