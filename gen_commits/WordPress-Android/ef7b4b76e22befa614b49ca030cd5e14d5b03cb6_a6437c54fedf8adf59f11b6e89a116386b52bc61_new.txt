feat(posts): Redesign list loading and display for posts/pages

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the posts and pages list architecture to improve maintainability, performance, and UI consistency.

Key changes include:
- Introduced `PostsListPost` lightweight data model for efficient UI display.
- Created `PostListAdapter` to manage list data, views, and pagination, replacing the old inner adapter and manual logic in `PostsListFragment`.
- Added `getPostsListPosts` method to `WordPressDB` for retrieving `PostsListPost` objects.
- Simplified `PostsListFragment` by delegating list management to the new adapter, removing complex manual data handling and the `ViewSwitcher`.
- Updated `row_post_page.xml` to use `WPTextView`, apply modern styles, implement title ellipsis for long titles, and refine status display layout.
- Streamlined post/page data loading and refresh mechanisms in `PostsActivity`.
