refactor: Relocate super.onPreviewChooseTapped() call

Move `super.onPreviewChooseTapped()` from `onPreviewChooseTapped()` to `onChooseTapped()`.
This ensures that the superclass's common choose logic, such as analytics tracking,
is triggered only when a specific layout is successfully selected and processed.
