perf: Remove delay for site title input focus

The 500ms delay for requesting focus on the site title input field
during new site creation has been removed. The keyboard will now appear
immediately when the screen loads, improving responsiveness.

This change also simplifies the `NewSiteCreationSiteInfoViewModel` by
removing the need for coroutine-based delay logic and its dependency
on `MAIN_DISPATCHER`.
