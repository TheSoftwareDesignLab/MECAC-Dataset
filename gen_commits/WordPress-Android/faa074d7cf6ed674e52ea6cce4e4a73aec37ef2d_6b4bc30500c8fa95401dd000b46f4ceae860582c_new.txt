style(ui): Customize SummaryEditTextPreference dialog appearance

Overrides `showDialog` to use an `AlertDialog.Builder` with the `Calypso_AlertDialog` theme, a custom title layout, and styled buttons.
Overrides `onBindDialogView` to ensure the `EditText` is correctly attached and styled with the appropriate typeface and color.
Adds `onDismiss` handling for proper dialog lifecycle management.
This change improves the visual consistency of preference dialogs with the overall app theme.
