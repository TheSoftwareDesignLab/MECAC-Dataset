refactor: PhotoPicker UI models become sealed classes

Converts PhotoListUiModel, ActionModeUiModel, and SoftAskViewUiModel from
nullable data classes to non-nullable sealed class hierarchies. This
improves type safety and clarifies UI state representation by
explicitly defining Visible/Data and Hidden/Empty states, reducing
reliance on null checks in the UI layer.
