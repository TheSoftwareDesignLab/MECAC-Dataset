feat: Add and apply text alignment to login input rows

The WPLoginInputRow custom view now supports the standard
`android:textAlignment` attribute, which is propagated to its internal
`EditText`. This enhancement allows developers to control text alignment
directly from XML for instances of this component.

This change also applies `android:textAlignment="viewStart"` and
`android:gravity="start"` to all login input fields and several
related TextViews. This ensures consistent start-aligned text
across the login flow, improving overall UI consistency and better
supporting Right-to-Left (RTL) languages.
