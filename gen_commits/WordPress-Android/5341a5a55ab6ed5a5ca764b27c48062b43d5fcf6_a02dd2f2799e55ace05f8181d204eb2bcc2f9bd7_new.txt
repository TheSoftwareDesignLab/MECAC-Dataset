feat: Add settings footer to menu drawer with slide animations

This commit introduces a dedicated "Settings" footer to the menu drawer,
replacing the previous list item for better accessibility.

Key changes include:
- Implemented slide-up and slide-down transition animations for PreferencesActivity.
- Refactored GCM token registration into a shared utility method in WordPress.
- Ensured GCM registration occurs immediately after successful WP.com account setup.
- Applied Sherlock Light theme to preference activities.
- Replaced various old animation files with new, specific slide animations.
