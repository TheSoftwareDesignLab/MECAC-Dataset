refactor: Address LayoutInflater InflateParams lint warnings

Added `//noinspection InflateParams` to suppress lint warnings for `LayoutInflater.inflate(..., null)`
calls throughout the codebase.

In `PeopleInviteFragment`, two instances were fixed by providing the parent `ViewGroup` and
explicitly setting `attachToRoot` to `false`. This also included a related layout adjustment
in `people_invite_error_view.xml` by removing an explicit top margin, allowing the parent
to manage its layout parameters.
