fix: Handle concurrent plugin state updates in detail view

Addresses race conditions where a plugin's state (active, auto-update) might diverge between the UI and database during a configuration network call.
If a discrepancy is detected upon receiving `OnSitePluginConfigured`, the UI state is prioritized, and another configuration action is dispatched.
This prevents premature plugin removal (`mIsRemovingPlugin`) until all configuration changes are fully reflected, ensuring state consistency.
