refactor: Streamline theme actions and simplify web flows

Renamed theme action methods (`onPreviewSelected`, `onDemoSelected`) and UI elements to `onTryAndCustomizeSelected` and `onViewSelected` for improved clarity. Consolidated 'Customize' functionality, removing `onCustomizeSelected` and `ThemeWebActivityType.CUSTOMIZE` to simplify web activity types and reduce redundancy. Updated strings and menu IDs accordingly.
