refactor: Implement PageParentViewModel for page list

Introduce `PageParentViewModel` to manage page data and actions. Update `PageParentFragment` to utilize this new ViewModel for setting up the page list `RecyclerView`, handling its lifecycle, and observing data changes.

This change promotes better separation of concerns by dedicating a ViewModel for page list management and ensures state restoration for the RecyclerView. `pages_parent_fragment.xml` has been replaced by `pages_list_fragment.xml`, which was updated to use `ConstraintLayout`.
