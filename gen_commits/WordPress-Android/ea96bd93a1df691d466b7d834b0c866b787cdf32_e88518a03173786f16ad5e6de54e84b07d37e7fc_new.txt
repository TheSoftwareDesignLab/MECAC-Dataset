refactor: Introduce NotificationsDetailFragment for tablet UI

Refactors the tablet landscape notifications UI by introducing `NotificationsDetailFragment` as a dedicated container for note detail fragments.

This change simplifies `NotificationsActivity` by delegating the management of specific note detail fragments (e.g., comment, like, general list) to the new `NotificationsDetailFragment`. It improves the modularity and robustness of the dual-pane layout and removes the unused `yPosition` parameter from note click handling.
