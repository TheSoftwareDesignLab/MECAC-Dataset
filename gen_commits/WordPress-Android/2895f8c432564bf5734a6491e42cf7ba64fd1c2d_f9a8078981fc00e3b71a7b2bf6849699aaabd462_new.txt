fix: Improve stats group chevron animation state handling

Ensure the chevron icon's visual state is correctly initialized before
starting the group expansion/collapse animation. The `setImageResource`
call sets the drawable to reflect the group's *prior* state, providing a
consistent starting point. This prevents potential visual glitches and
jumps, especially if the view was recycled or its state became
inconsistent. The animation angles were adjusted to work with this
pre-set initial image.
