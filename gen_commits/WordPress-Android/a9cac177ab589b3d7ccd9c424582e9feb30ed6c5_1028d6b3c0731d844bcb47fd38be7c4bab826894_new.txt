fix: Update Quick Start focus point vertical offset calculation

Adjusts the vertical offset calculation for the Quick Start focus
point. The previous calculation was -focusPointSize / 2; it now uses
(actionRowContainer.width - focusPointSize) / 2 to ensure correct
visual placement within the action row container.
