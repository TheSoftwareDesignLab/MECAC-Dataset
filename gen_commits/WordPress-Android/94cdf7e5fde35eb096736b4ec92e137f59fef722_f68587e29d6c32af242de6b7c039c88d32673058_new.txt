feat: Focus comment reply field for instant reply notes

Removes the unused `FROM_NOTIFICATION_EXTRA` intent flag.
Introduces a mechanism to automatically focus the comment reply input field
in `CommentDetailFragment` when an instant reply notification is triggered.
This improves the user experience by streamlining the workflow for quick responses.
The `NOTE_INSTANT_REPLY_EXTRA` now signals this behavior.
