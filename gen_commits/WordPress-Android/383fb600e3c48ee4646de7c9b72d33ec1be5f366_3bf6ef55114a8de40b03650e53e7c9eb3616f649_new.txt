feat: Implement responsive layouts for post-signup interstitial

Refactor the post-signup interstitial screen to support different screen sizes and orientations.
- Introduce `post_signup_interstitial_default.xml` and `post_signup_interstitial_landscape.xml` for modular layout definitions.
- Add specific layout includes for landscape (`layout-land`) and sw600dp (`layout-sw600dp`) configurations.
- Update `PostSignupInterstitialActivity` to utilize the new layout structure.
- Increase the maximum width for interstitial content from 360dp to 512dp.
