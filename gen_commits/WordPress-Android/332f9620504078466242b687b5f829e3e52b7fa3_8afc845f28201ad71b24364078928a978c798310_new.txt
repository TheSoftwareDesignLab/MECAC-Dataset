feat: Handle permanent permission denials in Story Composer

Integrates PermanentPermissionDenialDialogProvider to display user-friendly dialogs when essential permissions are permanently denied for the Story Composer. This guides users to app settings for re-enabling permissions.

The WPPermissionUtils.showPermissionAlwaysDeniedDialog method is now public, and a string resource for microphone permission has been added.
