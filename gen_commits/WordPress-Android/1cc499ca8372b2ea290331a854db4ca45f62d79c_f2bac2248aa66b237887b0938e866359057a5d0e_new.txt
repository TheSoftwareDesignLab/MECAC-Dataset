fix: Reset stats graph bar selection on tablet rotation

On 720DP tablets, the number of bars in the stats graph can change with
device orientation. Previously, this could lead to an invalid or
out-of-bounds selection for the highlighted bar after rotation.

This change introduces a mechanism to track the previous number of
graph bars. If the bar count changes upon rotation, the selected bar
index is reset to the last bar in the new dataset, ensuring a valid
selection is always shown.
