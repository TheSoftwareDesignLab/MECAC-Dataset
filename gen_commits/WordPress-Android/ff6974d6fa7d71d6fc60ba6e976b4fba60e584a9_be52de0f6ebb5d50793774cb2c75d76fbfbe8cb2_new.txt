perf: Optimize Reader post detail fragment lifecycle

The `showPost()` method in `onStart()` is now called conditionally, only if `!hasPost()`. This prevents unnecessary reprocessing or reloading of post content when the fragment resumes.

Additionally, curly braces were added to single-statement `if` blocks in `onPause()` and `onResume()` for `pauseWebView()` and `resumeWebView()`, enhancing code clarity and safety.
