refactor(site-creation): Move site fetch to preview ViewModel

Moves the responsibility of fetching newly created site details from the SiteCreationProgressViewModel to the SitePreviewViewModel.

Previously, the progress ViewModel would attempt to fetch the site from the remote when it received a 'NotInLocalDb' result. This logic is now handled by the preview ViewModel.

The SitePreviewViewModel now uses the injected Dispatcher, SiteStore, and FetchWpComSiteUseCase to transition a 'NotInLocalDb' result to a 'Completed' result upon initialization or on 'Ok' button tap.
