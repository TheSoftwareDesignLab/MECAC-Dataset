fix: Refresh posts list after successful post update

Ensure the posts list UI is updated when a post modification event
occurs without error. Previously, the list might not have
automatically refreshed, leading to stale data being displayed
after a post was successfully updated. This change calls
`loadPosts(LoadMode.IF_CHANGED)` to synchronize the UI with the
FluxC PostStore.
