refactor: Encapsulate MLP button UI state in ViewModel

Moves the logic for determining the visibility of action buttons (Create Blank Page, Create Page, Preview) in the Modal Layout Picker from the Fragment to the ViewModel.

Introduces a `ButtonsUiState` data class to hold the visibility flags and exposes this state via a LiveData object in the ViewModel. This improves separation of concerns and makes the button UI state management more robust and testable.
