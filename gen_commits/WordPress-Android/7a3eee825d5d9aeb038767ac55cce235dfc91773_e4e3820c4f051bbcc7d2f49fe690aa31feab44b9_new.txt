refactor(login): Simplify prologue scaling and remove unused assets

The scaling logic in `LoginProloguePageFragment` was simplified for the content area,
removing a potentially incorrect `+ 1` adjustment in the scale factor calculation.

Additionally, this commit removes:
- `login_prologue_first_asset_five.png` and its density variants, as the asset is no longer used.
- The unused `content_description_logo` string resource.
