- Wrapped title and label TextViews in focusable LinearLayouts for improved accessibility.
- Added `android:importantForAccessibility="no"` to RecyclerViews in domain and theme screens.
- Marked site category ImageViews as non-important for accessibility.
- Reordered XML attributes in several layout files for consistency.
- Added new string: `notification_site_creation_title_in_progress`.
