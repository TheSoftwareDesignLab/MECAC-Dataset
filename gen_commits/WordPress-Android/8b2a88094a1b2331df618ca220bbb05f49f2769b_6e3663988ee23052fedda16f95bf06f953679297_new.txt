feat: Implement animated checkmark for comment selection

Adds a visual animated checkmark that appears over the comment avatar when an item is selected. This improves feedback during multi-selection.
The checkmark animates in when selected and animates out when deselected.
Action mode now automatically finishes when all comments are deselected.
