refactor: Remove widgets_enabled string and usage

The 'widgets_enabled' string resource has been removed from string.xml files in both Jetpack and main modules. Its explicit usage to control the StatsViewsWidget's 'android:enabled' attribute in AndroidManifest.xml was also removed. This simplifies widget configuration as the 'android:enabled' attribute defaults to true, making the string resource redundant.
