refactor: Pass Photon capability status with page list data

The PageListViewModel now emits the site's Photon capability status
alongside the page list via a `LiveData<Pair<List<PageItem>, Boolean>>`.
This ensures the `isSitePhotonCapable` flag is always in sync with the
page data when received by the `PageListFragment`, improving consistency
and reactive data flow compared to accessing it as a separate ViewModel
property.
