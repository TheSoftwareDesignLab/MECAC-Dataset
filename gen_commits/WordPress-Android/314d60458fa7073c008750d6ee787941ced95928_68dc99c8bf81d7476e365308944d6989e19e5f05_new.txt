refactor(reader): Remove dynamic footer and toolbar visibility

Removed scroll-based logic that would hide the footer and toolbar in ReaderPostDetailFragment. This simplifies the UI interaction and ensures the footer is always visible.

The footer and error/sign-in views were also repositioned in `reader_fragment_post_detail.xml` to reflect these changes.
