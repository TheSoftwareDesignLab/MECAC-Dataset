feat: Animate Reader post pager exit on back press

Applies a custom animation when exiting the ReaderPostPagerActivity via
the back button. The current activity slides out to the right, while the
previous activity scales in and fades in. This transition is applied
when full-screen is supported.
Also adjusted the `toAlpha` value in `reader_activity_scale_out.xml`
from 0.75 to 0.5.
