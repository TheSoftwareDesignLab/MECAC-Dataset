refactor: Make PagesViewModel UI coroutine context injectable

Introduces `uiCoroutineContext` as an injectable dependency in `PagesViewModel`, defaulting to `UI`. This enhances testability by allowing a specific `CoroutineContext` to be passed during unit tests instead of relying on the global `UI` dispatcher.

Tests now initialize the ViewModel within each method, injecting the `coroutineContext` from `runBlocking` for controlled execution.
