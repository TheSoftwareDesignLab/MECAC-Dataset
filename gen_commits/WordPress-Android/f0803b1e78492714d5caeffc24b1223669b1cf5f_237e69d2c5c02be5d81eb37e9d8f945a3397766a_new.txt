feat: Animate Reader like and comment counts

Introduce animated count changes for likes and comments in Reader posts.
When counts update due to user interaction (liking, commenting), the count number will now scale in or out to provide visual feedback. This is controlled by an `animateChanges` parameter added to the `setCount` method in `ReaderIconCountView`.
