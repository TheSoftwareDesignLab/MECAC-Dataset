fix: Avoid applying stale image responses to recycled WPNetworkImageView

When WPNetworkImageView instances are used in recycled UI items, such as RecyclerView cells, an image request for a previous item might complete after the view has been reused for a new item with a different URL. This could lead to the wrong image being displayed.

This change introduces a WPNetworkImageListener that keeps track of the URL requested for its specific instance. Before applying an image response or error, it verifies that the current view's URL still matches the originally requested URL, preventing stale responses from being applied.
