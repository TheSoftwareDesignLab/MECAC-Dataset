feat: Implement fetching current theme and all WP.com themes

This commit introduces new functionality for retrieving theme data.

- Adds `fetchWpComSiteThemes` to `ThemeRestClient` for fetching all themes available to a WP.com site (via `v1.2/site/$siteId/themes`).
- Adds `fetchCurrentTheme` to `ThemeRestClient` for fetching the currently active theme for any site (via `v1.1/site/$siteId/themes/mine`).
- Integrates `fetchCurrentTheme` into `ThemeStore`, enabling the dispatcher to trigger the network request.
- Persists the fetched current theme into the local database upon successful retrieval.
