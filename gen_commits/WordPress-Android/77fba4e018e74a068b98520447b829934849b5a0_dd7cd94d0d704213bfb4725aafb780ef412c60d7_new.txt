feat: Add login check for Stats widget configuration

Prevents users from attempting to configure a Stats widget if they are not logged in to the WordPress app. A toast message is displayed instructing the user to log in if an access token is not present. This refactors the dialog opening mechanism using LiveData events for better UI/ViewModel separation.
