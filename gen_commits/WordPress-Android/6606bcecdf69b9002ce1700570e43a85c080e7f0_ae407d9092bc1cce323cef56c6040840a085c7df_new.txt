feat: Enable navigation from Foundation and add Colors screen

The `DesignSystemFoundationScreen` now accepts an `onButtonClicked` callback. This allows its parent, `DesignSystem`, to handle button taps and navigate to respective sub-screens (e.g., 'Colors', 'Components').

A new `DesignSystemScreen.Colors` entry and a corresponding `DesignSystemColorsScreen` route have been added to the Design System.
