feat: Add dynamic background to login prologue pages

Introduces a mechanism to specify and inflate a custom background layout for each login prologue page.

- Added `promoBackgroundId` to `LoginProloguePageFragment` and `LoginProloguePagerAdapter`.
- `login_intro_template_view.xml` was updated with a `promo_background_container` to host the background layout.
- Root padding was removed from `login_intro_template_view` and individual margins were applied to the title and content containers.
- This allows for more visually rich and unique backgrounds per prologue slide.
