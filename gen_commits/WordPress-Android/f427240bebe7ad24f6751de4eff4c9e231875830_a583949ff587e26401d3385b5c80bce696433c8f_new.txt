fix: Ensure refresh animation starts if themes are fetching

Previously, the refresh button animation would only start if `mFetchingThemes` was set to true *after* the options menu was created. This change ensures that if themes are already being fetched when `onCreateOptionsMenu` is called, the refresh button immediately shows its animation, providing correct visual feedback to the user.
