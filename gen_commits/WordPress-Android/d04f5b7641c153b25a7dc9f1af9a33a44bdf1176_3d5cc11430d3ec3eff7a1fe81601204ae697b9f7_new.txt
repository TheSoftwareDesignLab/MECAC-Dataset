refactor: Simplify EditPostActivityHook access in fragment

Removed the `mEditPostActivityHook` member variable and its management
in `onAttach`/`onDetach`. Introduced a `getHook()` helper method to
dynamically retrieve the `EditPostActivityHook` from the attached
activity when needed. This approach avoids holding a direct reference
to the hook as a member, improving fragment lifecycle management.
