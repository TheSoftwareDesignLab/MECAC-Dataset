refactor: Move AppBar and Toolbar setup to ReaderPostDetailFragment

This change refactors the Reader post detail screen by moving the AppBarLayout and Toolbar setup from `ReaderPostPagerActivity` to `ReaderPostDetailFragment`. This consolidates the responsibility for the post detail's AppBar and Toolbar within the fragment itself, improving modularity.

The `reader_fragment_post_detail.xml` now includes the AppBar and sets the `AppBarLayout.ScrollingViewBehavior` on the main scrollable content. `ReaderPostPagerActivity` is simplified, no longer managing these components directly or implementing `ScrollableViewInitializedListener`.
