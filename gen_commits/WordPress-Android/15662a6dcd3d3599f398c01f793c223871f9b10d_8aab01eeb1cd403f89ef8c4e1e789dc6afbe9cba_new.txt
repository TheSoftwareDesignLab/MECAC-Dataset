feat: Implement accelerometer-driven looping text animation

Replaces the static auto-scrolling text in the login prologue with a new physics-based animation. The looping text and frosted glass background now react to accelerometer data from a ViewModel.

- Introduces `AcceleratingLoopingText` composable to handle continuous, velocity-constrained movement.
- Adds `runtime-livedata` dependency for observing LiveData in Compose.
- Integrates ViewModel injection and observation to pass accelerometer data to the UI.
