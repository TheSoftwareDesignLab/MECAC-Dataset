fix: Secure post deletion and refine discard logic

Refactor `WordPressDB.java` to use parameterized queries in `deletePost` to prevent SQL injection and simplify return logic.
Adjust `EditPostActivity.java` discard logic to correctly handle new autosaved posts, preventing `mOriginalPost.update()` from being called unnecessarily for new posts.
