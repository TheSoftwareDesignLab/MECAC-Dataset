feat: Add new dark mode style for Reader follow button

Introduce a dedicated style for the Reader follow button in dark mode.
This includes new drawables for the button's background, color states,
and ripple effect, ensuring a consistent and appropriate appearance
when using the dark theme. The `followButtonStyle` attribute is
updated to reference this new style.
