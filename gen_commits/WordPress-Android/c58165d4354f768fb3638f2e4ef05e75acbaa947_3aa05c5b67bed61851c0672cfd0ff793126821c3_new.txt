feat: Implement UI state handling for categories list

Adds initial UI state management for CategoriesListFragment.
The fragment now observes CategoriesListViewModel.UiState to display loading, error, and content views.
Includes dedicated methods for updating the UI based on these states, showing a progress bar or an actionable empty view for errors.
Initializes the RecyclerView and its associated empty view.
