fix: Refine spacing for reader post excerpt title and header

Dynamically adjust the top margin of the post title in reader list items.
- Added padding to the post header to provide consistent spacing below it.
- Removed static top margin from the featured image in XML.
- The post title's top margin is now calculated:
    - It receives `margin_large` if a featured image or video is present.
    - It gets no top margin if no featured media and the header is visible.
    - It receives `margin_large` if no featured media and the header is hidden (e.g., in a blog preview) to ensure proper separation.
This ensures consistent and improved visual spacing for post excerpts across various display configurations.
