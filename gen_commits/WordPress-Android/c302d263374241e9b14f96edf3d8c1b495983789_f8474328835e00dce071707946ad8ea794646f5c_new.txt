refactor: Centralize main view setup and navigation lifecycle

Moved the logic for setting up the bottom navigation (or showing MySiteFragment)
from `onCreate` to a new `setUpMainView` method. This method is now called
in `onResume` to dynamically adapt the main view based on the Jetpack feature
removal flag.

Added a `clear()` method to `WPMainNavigationView` to remove all attached
fragments and listeners, ensuring a clean slate when the bottom navigation
is hidden. Also introduced `clearFragmentBackStack` to manage the fragment
back stack effectively during view transitions.

This change improves the robustness and correctness of the main screen's UI
state management across the activity lifecycle.
