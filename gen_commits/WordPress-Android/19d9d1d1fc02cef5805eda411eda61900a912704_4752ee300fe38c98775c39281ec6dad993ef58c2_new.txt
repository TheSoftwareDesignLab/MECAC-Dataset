feat: Adjust text layout for badge notifications

Introduces an 'isBadge' property to NoteBlock, which, when set, ensures the notification text is horizontally centered and has specific top padding. This improves the visual presentation for badge-style notifications.

Also, fixes an issue in NotificationsUtils to safely return a spannable string builder when JSON ranges are not found, preventing unnecessary error logs.
