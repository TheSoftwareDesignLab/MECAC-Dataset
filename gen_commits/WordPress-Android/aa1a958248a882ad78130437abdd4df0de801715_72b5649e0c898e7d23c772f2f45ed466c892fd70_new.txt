feat: Implement author filtering for WordPress.com post lists

The PostListViewModel now passes the selected author filter (ME or EVERYONE)
to the PostListDescriptorForRestSite when fetching posts from sites
using the WordPress.com REST API. The AccountStore is utilized to retrieve
the current user's ID for the 'ME' filter.

The visibility check for the author filter has been updated to use
`site.isUsingWpComRestApi`.

Includes a FluxC version bump for required author filtering changes.
