feat: Dynamically load Gutenberg editor theme

Replaces hardcoded editor theme colors and gradients with a dynamically provided
theme bundle. This allows the Gutenberg editor to apply site-specific or
remotely configured themes, improving visual consistency and theming flexibility.
The editor theme is retrieved from the EditorThemeStore and passed down from
EditPostActivity.
