test: Ensure screenshot tests run in light mode

Consolidate screenshot test setup to consistently use light mode.
Replaced calls to `setNightModeAndWait(boolean)` with a new `setLightModeAndWait()` helper
that explicitly sets `setNightMode(false)`. This ensures all captured screenshots
are consistently taken in light mode, simplifying test logic.
