refactor: Rename quick start drawable and simplify color usage

Renamed `quick_start_focus_outer_circle.xml` to `bg_oval_primary_100.xml` for a more generic and reusable name.
Removed the redundant color resource `quickstart_focus_outer_circle`, which was an alias to `primary_100`, and updated the drawable to directly reference `primary_100`.
Updated `quick_start_focus_circle.xml` to reference the new drawable name.
