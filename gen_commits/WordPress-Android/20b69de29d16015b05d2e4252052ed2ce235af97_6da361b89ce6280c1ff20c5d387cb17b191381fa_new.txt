refactor: Move Reader post detail toolbar to scroll with content

The toolbar for Reader post detail is now included and managed directly
within `ReaderPostDetailFragment` instead of `ReaderPostPagerActivity`.

This change allows the toolbar to scroll along with the post's header and
content within the `WPScrollView`, providing a more integrated experience.
It also ensures consistent use of `AppCompatActivity` for ActionBar handling.
