feat: Enhance domain cost display for paid plans

Introduce `Plan` composable to show strikethrough pricing for domains included with a paid plan.
Display a plan subtitle above the domain details for `Cost.Paid` domains.
Refactor domain item cost rendering logic using `when` for different `Cost` types.
Correct typo: Rename `SalePrince` to `SalePrice`.
