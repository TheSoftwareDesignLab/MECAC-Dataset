feat: Auto-refresh media and themes on blog change

When the active blog is changed, both MediaBrowserActivity and ThemeBrowserActivity will now automatically refresh their content (media and themes, respectively).
A refresh animation will be displayed in the action bar while data is being fetched. ThemeBrowserActivity also gains a dedicated refresh menu button.
