fix: Persist comment reply drafts uniquely

The SuggestionAutoCompleteText widget now uses a unique ID
to differentiate saved text across instances. Previously,
draft text persistence relied solely on the view path, which
could lead to incorrect restoration or conflicts.

This change ensures that draft replies in the CommentDetailFragment
are saved and restored specifically to the comment they belong to
by utilizing a unique key derived from the blog and comment IDs.
