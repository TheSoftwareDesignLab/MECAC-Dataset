refactor: Improve async promo dialog condition logic

Refactor the conditional logic within `shouldShowAsyncPromoDialog()`
from a complex `if/else` chain to a `switch` statement.

This change enhances readability and maintainability by clearly
enumerating post statuses and their respective conditions for
showing the asynchronous publishing promo dialog. An early exit
check was also added for common prerequisite conditions.
