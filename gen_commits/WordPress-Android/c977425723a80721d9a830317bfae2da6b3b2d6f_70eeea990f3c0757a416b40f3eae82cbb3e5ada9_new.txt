feat: Apply theme-specific elevation to Reader cards

Introduce `reader_card_elevation` dimension to control CardView elevation.
This allows setting `0dp` elevation for day mode and `1dp` for night mode,
providing subtle visual separation for reader cards in dark themes.
Removes explicit `reader_card_background` color definitions.
