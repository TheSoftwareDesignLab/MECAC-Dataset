refactor: Use List for actions in PageListViewModel.UiState

The `actions` collection type in `PageListViewModel.UiState` was changed from
`Set<Action>` to `List<Action>`. This modification allows for the actions
to maintain a specific order, which is crucial for their consistent
presentation in the UI.
