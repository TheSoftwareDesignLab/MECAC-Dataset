feat: Mark Jetpack badge as non-interactive and decorative

This change ensures the Jetpack badge is purely a visual element and does not interfere with user interaction or accessibility services. By setting `android:enabled="false"` and `android:importantForAccessibility="no"`, the badge will not be focusable or announced by screen readers, improving the overall accessibility experience.
