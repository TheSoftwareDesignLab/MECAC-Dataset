fix: Handle video taps and improve VideoPress loading

Introduces logic to handle tap events on video elements. This change specifically addresses an issue on Android API<19 where VideoPress placeholder videos would not trigger the onError callback, preventing the full video from loading. Tapping a VideoPress placeholder now explicitly requests video information. Additionally, implements a callback for general video tap events when a WordPress ID is present.
