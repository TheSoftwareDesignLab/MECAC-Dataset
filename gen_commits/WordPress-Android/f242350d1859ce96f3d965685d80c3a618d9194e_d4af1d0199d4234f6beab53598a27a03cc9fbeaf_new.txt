feat(media): Apply site image quality setting and add 100% option

Image optimization now respects the image quality setting defined in site
preferences, rather than using a hardcoded value. This change ensures
uploaded images are optimized according to user configuration.

Additionally, a 100% quality option has been added to the available
choices for image quality in site settings.

This update also includes a refactor of the image quality string arrays
for improved separation of display entries and their corresponding values.
