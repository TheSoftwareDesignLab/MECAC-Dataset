feat: Implement dynamic tablet two-pane layout for notifications

Introduces a master-detail flow for `NewNotificationsActivity` on tablets,
especially in landscape orientation. Removes static `layout-sw600dp-land`
layouts in favor of dynamic fragment transactions and `configChanges`
handling. The notifications list (master) and detail view (detail) fragments
are now dynamically managed based on screen configuration, providing an
optimized viewing experience.
