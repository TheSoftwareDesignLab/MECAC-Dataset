feat(nux): Make domain suffix selectable and update styling

The ".wordpress.com" suffix in the new account screen is now selectable and
styled with a consistent font size and color.
- Replaced TextView with WPTextView.
- Changed text color to grey_medium.
- Introduced and applied 'nux_edit_field_font_size' (16sp).
