refactor: Migrate photo viewer to themed zoom animations

Replaced the custom `makeScaleUpAnimation` for the photo viewer
with standard window enter and exit animations.

This change:
- Replaces `zoom.xml` with dedicated `zoom_in.xml` and `zoom_out.xml`.
- Applies these animations to `ReaderActivityTheme` via a new `ReaderAnimation.ReaderZoom` style.
- Simplifies `ReaderActivityLauncher` and `ReaderPostDetailFragment` by removing
  the complex view-specific scale-up animation logic.
- Ensures a consistent zoom transition for the photo viewer.
