fix: Correct save/publish button text for various post statuses

Explicitly includes PRIVATE, PENDING, TRASHED, DRAFT, and SCHEDULED post
statuses to fall into the default logic for determining button text
in getSaveButtonText() and getSaveAsADraftButtonText().
This ensures consistent and accurate labeling for save and publish
actions across different post states.
