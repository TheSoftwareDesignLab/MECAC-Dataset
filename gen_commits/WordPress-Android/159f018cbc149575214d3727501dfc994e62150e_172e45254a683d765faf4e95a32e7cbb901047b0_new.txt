refactor: Simplify Jetpack banner initialization in Reader

Consolidates Jetpack banner animation and bottom sheet click listener setup
within ReaderPostListFragment. This removes the ScrollableViewInitializedListener
interface and its implementation from ReaderSearchActivity, improving code
organization by placing banner-related logic where the banner view is managed.
Also simplifies the application of bottom margins for the banner in
ReaderPostListFragment.
