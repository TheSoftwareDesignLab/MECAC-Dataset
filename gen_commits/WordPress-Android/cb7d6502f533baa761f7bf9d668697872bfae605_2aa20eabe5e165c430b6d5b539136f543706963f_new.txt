feat: Navigate to paid domain search from dashboard domain card

Introduces a new navigation action `OpenPaidDomainSearch` to explicitly handle clicks on the dashboard domain card. This routes users to the domain registration flow specifically for purchasing a domain, differentiating it from the existing `OpenDomainRegistration` used for credit redemption.
