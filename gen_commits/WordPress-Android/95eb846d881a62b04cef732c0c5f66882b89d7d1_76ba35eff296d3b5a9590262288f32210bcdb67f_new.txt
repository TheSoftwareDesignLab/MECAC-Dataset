feat: Add new strings for Gutenberg block editor UI

Add various new string resources to support:
- Block management actions (e.g., add, customize, move blocks).
- Improved user guidance and onboarding (e.g., how to edit posts/pages).
- General UI navigation and setting descriptions.

Updated one string to use "tap" instead of "click" for mobile context.
