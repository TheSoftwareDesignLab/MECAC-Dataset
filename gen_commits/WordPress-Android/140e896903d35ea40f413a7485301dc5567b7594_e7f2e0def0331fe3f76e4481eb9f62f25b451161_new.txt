refactor: Improve Quick Links Ribbon item text and focus logic

Refactors QuickLinkRibbonItemViewHolder to use string resources for item labels.
Consolidates QuickLinkRibbonViewHolder focus point logic, replacing specific
focus points (stats, pages, media) with a single "more" focus point scrolling
to the last ribbon item.
