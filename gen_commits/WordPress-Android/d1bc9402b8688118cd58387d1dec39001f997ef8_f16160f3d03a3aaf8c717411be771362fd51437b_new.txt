refactor: Make onLayoutTapped open for overriding in child classes

The `onLayoutTapped` function in `LayoutPickerViewModel` has been made `open`.
This change allows subclasses, such as `HomePagePickerViewModel`, to
override the default layout tap behavior, enabling future custom
implementations for layout selection and preview.
