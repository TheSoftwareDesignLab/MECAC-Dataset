refactor: Consolidate Gutenberg editor settings builder

Introduces a `GutenbergKitConfig` object to encapsulate all necessary configuration for the Gutenberg editor. This refactors the creation of authorization data and editor settings from `GutenbergKitActivity` into the `GutenbergKitSettingsBuilder` and `GutenbergKitEditorFragment`'s `newInstanceWithBuilder` factory method.

This change simplifies the `GutenbergKitActivity` by reducing its responsibility for detailed editor fragment setup, improving maintainability and code organization.

Also, improves UserAgent constructor robustness by gracefully handling null contexts.
