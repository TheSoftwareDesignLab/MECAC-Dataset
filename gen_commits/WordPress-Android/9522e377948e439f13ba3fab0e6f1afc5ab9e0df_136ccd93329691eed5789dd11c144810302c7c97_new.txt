feat: Defer reader refresh and improve new posts bar hiding

When new or changed posts are detected, display the "New Posts" bar instead of
immediately refreshing the list, allowing the user to trigger the refresh.

The "New Posts" bar now hides on scroll in any direction (up or down) when the
scroll distance exceeds a threshold, using `Math.abs(dy)` for consistent UI
behavior.
