fix: Prevent comment list purge when viewing a specific comment

Removed `showCommentDetailForNote` from `NotificationsDetailActivity` and the unused `ReaderDatabase` import, as this method is no longer used for launching `CommentDetailActivity`.
Updated `ReaderCommentListActivity` to only purge excess comments for a post when not navigating to a specific comment ID (`mCommentId == 0`). This prevents unintended data purging when a user opens a particular comment.
