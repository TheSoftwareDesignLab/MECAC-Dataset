feat: Media Picker: Hide search bar on empty state

The search bar in the Media Picker is now dynamically hidden when an
empty state is displayed, as there is no content to search.

This improves the user experience by removing unnecessary UI elements.

Also, updated the content description for generic empty view
illustrations.
