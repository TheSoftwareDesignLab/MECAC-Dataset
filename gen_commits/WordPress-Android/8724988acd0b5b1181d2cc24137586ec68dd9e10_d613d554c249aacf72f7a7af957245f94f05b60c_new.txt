feat: Implement experimental Jetpack REST connection flow

Introduces an experimental Jetpack REST connection flow, replacing the existing web-based flow for eligible sites when the feature flag is enabled.

This change includes:
- A new `JetpackRestConnectionActivity` with a Compose UI (`JetpackRestConnectionScreen`).
- A `JetpackRestConnectionViewModel` to manage the connection steps and state.
- A reusable `ScreenWithTopAppBarM3` Compose component.
- Integration into the `ExperimentalFeatures` system.
- Conditional launch of this new flow from `StatsConnectJetpackActivity`.
- New strings and colors for the feature.
