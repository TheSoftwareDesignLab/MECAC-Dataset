feat: Reader post detail toolbar adapts color on collapse

Dynamically adjusts the toolbar's title text and icon colors in the Reader post detail screen based on the `CollapsingToolbarLayout`'s collapse state. This ensures better visual consistency with the app's theme by using `colorOnSurface` when collapsed and `colorSurface` when expanded.
