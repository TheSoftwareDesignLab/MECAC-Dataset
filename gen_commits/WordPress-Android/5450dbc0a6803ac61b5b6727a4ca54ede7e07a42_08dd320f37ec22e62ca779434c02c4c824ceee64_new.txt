refactor(image-editor): Migrate crop result communication to ViewModel

Replaces SavedStateHandle with a shared EditImageViewModel for passing crop results between fragments in the image editor flow.

The EditImageViewModel, scoped to EditImageActivity, now acts as a central hub for handling one-time events like crop outcomes. This provides a more robust and predictable way to deliver results compared to the NavBackStackEntry's SavedStateHandle, which required manual clearing.

CropFragment now posts crop results to the shared ViewModel, and PreviewImageFragment observes these results, ensuring proper state management when navigating back to the preview screen.

Also adjusts Navigation Component version to 2.2.2.
