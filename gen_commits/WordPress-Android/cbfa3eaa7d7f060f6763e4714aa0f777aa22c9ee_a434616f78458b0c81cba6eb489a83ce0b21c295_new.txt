fix: Preserve cursor position when truncating text field

Refactor `OutlinedTextField` to use `TextFieldValue` for state management.
This ensures the cursor and selection maintain their correct positions
when the input text is truncated to its maximum length. Previously, the
cursor could jump to an unexpected location after truncation.
