refactor(stats): Streamline tab content rendering

The previous implementation for tabbed blocks in Stats Insights used a
ViewPager and nested RecyclerViews to display content for each tab.

This change removes the BlockTabPagerAdapter and the nested RecyclerView
from BlockItemViewHolder. Instead, the content for the currently
selected tab is generated directly by the UseCase and added to the main
list of BlockListItem objects when a tab is selected.

This simplifies the UI hierarchy, improves rendering efficiency, and
reduces memory usage by avoiding multiple nested RecyclerView instances.
