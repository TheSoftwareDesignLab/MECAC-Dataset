refactor(settings): Rename video bitrate to video quality

Updates the terminology in site settings from "Video Bitrate" to
"Video Quality" to improve user comprehension. The video quality
options are now referenced by descriptive quality strings (e.g., 80%)
instead of raw kilobyte values (e.g., 1000 KB).

Also corrects capitalization for the "Image Quality" setting title.
