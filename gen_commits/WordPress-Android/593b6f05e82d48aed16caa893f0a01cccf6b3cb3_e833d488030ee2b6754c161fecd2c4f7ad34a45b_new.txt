feat: Propagate restore results through activity log

The ActivityLogDetailActivity now handles the RESTORE request code,
setting its own result and finishing if the restore is successful.

The ActivityLogListActivity has been updated to conditionally process
results from ACTIVITY_LOG_DETAIL as RESTORE results when the restore
feature is enabled. This ensures that the outcome of a restore operation
initiated from the detail view is correctly handled in the list view.
