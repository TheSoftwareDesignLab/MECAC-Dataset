feat: Add `closeAccount` logic to manage pending UI state

Introduces the `closeAccount` function to handle the initiation of account closure.
This function updates the `accountClosureUiState` to `isPending = true`
to indicate an ongoing operation.

Currently, a `delay(3000)` is used to simulate an asynchronous task,
after which the state is reverted to `isPending = false`.
This lays the groundwork for integrating the actual account closure API call.
