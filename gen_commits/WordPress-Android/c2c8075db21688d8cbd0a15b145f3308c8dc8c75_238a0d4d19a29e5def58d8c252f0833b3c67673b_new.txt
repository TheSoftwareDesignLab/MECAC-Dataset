refactor(login): Modernize UI and scrolling for login screens

Migrate `ScrollView` to `NestedScrollView` for improved scroll behavior. Update login screen XML layouts to ensure correct vertical distribution and consistent bottom button placement. Refactor button container to `LinearLayout` for simpler arrangement. Implement logic to make primary button `MATCH_PARENT` width when no secondary button is visible.
