- Remove Simperium integration from notification management.
- Introduce `NotificationsTable` for local storage of notification data.
- Update `GCMMessageService` and UI components to retrieve notes from the local database.
- Use WordPress.com REST API to fetch new notifications and mark notes as read.
- This change improves the robustness and control over notification handling.
