refactor: Simplify photo picker thumbnail layout and elevation handling

Removes an unnecessary FrameLayout from photo_picker_thumbnail.xml,
flattening the view hierarchy for better performance.

Updates PhotoPickerAdapter to directly use 4dp for elevation,
improving consistency in UI element spacing.
