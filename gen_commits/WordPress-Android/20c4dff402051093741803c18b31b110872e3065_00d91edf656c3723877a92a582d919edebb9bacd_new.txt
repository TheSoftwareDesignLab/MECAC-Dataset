refactor: Remove redundant RelativeLayout attributes from layouts

Removed various `android:layout_alignParent*`, `android:layout_to*`, `android:layout_align*`, and `android:layout_below` attributes from several XML layout files. These attributes were specific to `RelativeLayout` and were either redundant or no longer required for proper layout.
