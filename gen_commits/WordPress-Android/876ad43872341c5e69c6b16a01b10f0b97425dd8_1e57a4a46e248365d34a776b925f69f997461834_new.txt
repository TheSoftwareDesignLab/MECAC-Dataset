refactor(stats): Simplify quick scan item layout and limit title lines

The `stats_quick_scan_item` layout was refactored from ConstraintLayout to LinearLayout for a simpler horizontal arrangement using `layout_weight`.

Additionally, the title in `stats_block_list_item_with_image` is now limited to two lines to prevent excessive vertical space. The unused `margin_90dp` dimension was also removed.
