feat: Dynamically control MySite AppBar lift-on-scroll and header visibility

Centralizes the control of the AppBar's lift-on-scroll behavior and the header's
visibility within the `SiteInfoToolbarViewParams`. This allows the ViewModel
to dictate these UI properties based on the current MySite state, removing
hardcoded logic from the fragment.
