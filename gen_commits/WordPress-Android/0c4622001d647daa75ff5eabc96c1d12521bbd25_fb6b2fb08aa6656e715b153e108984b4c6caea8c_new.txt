fix: Enhance image upload and query, refresh UI background

Corrected image path retrieval in `editPost.java` to use `selectedImageIDs`, ensuring the correct image is processed during upload.
Simplified image data querying in `viewPosts.java` by directly using `imageUri`, improving robustness.
Updated the background color in multiple layout files (`add_account.xml`, `edit.xml`, `edit_page.xml`, `main.xml`, `main_page.xml`, `settings.xml`) from `#FFF0F0F0` to a slightly lighter `#FFF5F5F5`.
Binary assets (`.apk`, `.dex`, `.ap_`) updated accordingly.
