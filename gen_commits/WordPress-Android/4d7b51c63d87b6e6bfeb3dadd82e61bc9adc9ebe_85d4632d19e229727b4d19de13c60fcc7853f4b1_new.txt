feat: Introduce unified comment list UI model helper

This new helper class `CommentListUiModelHelper` is responsible for
building and managing the UI state for the unified comment list screen.
It abstracts the logic for constructing various UI representations,
including the main comment list, action mode, and confirmation dialogs.
It defines data structures like `CommentsListUiModel`, `ActionModeUiModel`,
and `ConfirmationDialogUiModel` to represent different states of the
comment list UI, promoting a cleaner separation of concerns.
