fix(e2e): Update Reader like/unlike test interactions

Updated the ReaderViewPage like button resource ID.
Changed the like interaction from direct click() to D-pad navigation for improved reliability.
Removed the initial verifyPostNotLiked assertion from the likePost test.
Added a step to click the post title to dismiss any lingering focus after liking.
