refactor: Modernize MediaSettings TextInputTheme

Switches the parent theme from `TextAppearance.AppCompat` to `ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Light`.
Removes outdated `textColorHighlight` and `textColorLink` properties that were part of a workaround for an ASUS crash, as they are no longer needed or handled by the new theme. Adds explicit `android:textSize` for consistent text sizing.
