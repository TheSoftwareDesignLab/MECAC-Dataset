feat: Track Full Site Editing (FSE) theme status

This commit introduces an `isFSETheme` boolean property to the `EditorTheme` and `EditorThemeSupport` models. This property indicates whether a theme supports Full Site Editing (FSE).

The change includes:
- Adding `isFSETheme` to the `EditorThemeSupport` data class and its persistence.
- Updating `EditorTheme` to include the `isFSETheme` property when creating `EditorThemeSupport` from a bundle.
- Adding a new `IS_FSETHEME` column to the `EditorTheme` table in the database.
- Incrementing the database version and providing a migration for the new column.
