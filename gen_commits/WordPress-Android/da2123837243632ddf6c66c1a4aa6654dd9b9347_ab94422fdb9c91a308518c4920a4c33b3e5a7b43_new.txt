feat: Redesign login site check error state

Completely revamped the UI for `fragment_login_site_check_error.xml`.
This transforms a plain error message into a more informative and actionable empty state.

Key changes include:
- Migrated to `ConstraintLayout` with a new `ImageView` illustration.
- Updated the `login_not_a_jetpack_site` string for clearer instructions.
- Added "See instructions" and "Try with another account" buttons.
