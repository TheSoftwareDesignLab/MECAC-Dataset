feat: Update dialog input fields to Material Design style

Replaced plain EditText with TextInputLayout.OutlinedBox for a more modern look
in `PostSettingsInputDialogFragment` and `post_settings_input_dialog.xml`.
The dialog's title is now used as the hint for the TextInputLayout.
Adjusted layout paddings and margins in `add_category.xml` and
`post_settings_input_dialog.xml` for consistent Material Design spacing.
