feat: Setup modular project, add utils, and enable publishing

This commit introduces a major overhaul of the project structure and build system:

- **New `WordPressUtils` Library**: Added `libs/utils/WordPressUtils` as a new Android library, providing a collection of reusable helper classes.
- **Editor Module Refactor**:
  - `EditorActivity` was refactored into an `EditorFragment` hosted by a lightweight `EditorActivity`.
  - Package names updated to `org.wordpress.android.editor`.
  - Configured Maven publishing to Sonatype OSSRH for AAR distribution.
  - Lowered `minSdkVersion` from 15 to 9.
  - Updated dependencies to include the new `WordPressUtils` library.
- **Build System Upgrade**: Migrated the entire project to Gradle 1.0.0.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrated Travis CI for automated builds.
- **Example App Update**: Adjusted to use the refactored editor and new package names.
