fix: Keep retry visible after high-res image load failure

Previously, if a high-resolution image failed to load, and a low-resolution version then loaded successfully, the UI would incorrectly show a progress bar instead of preserving the retry prompt.

This change ensures that the retry layout remains visible, and the progress bar is hidden, providing clearer feedback to the user. The state management logic for this scenario has been encapsulated within the `ImageInLowResLoadSuccessUiState`.
