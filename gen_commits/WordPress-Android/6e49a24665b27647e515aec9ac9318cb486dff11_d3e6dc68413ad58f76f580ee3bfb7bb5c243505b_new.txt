fix: Show "Immediately" label for posts set to publish now

The PrepublishingHomeViewModel now explicitly displays "Immediately" as the publish date label if `postSettingsUtils.getPublishDateLabel()` returns an empty string. This clarifies the publish schedule for posts configured to publish immediately, improving UX by avoiding a blank label.
