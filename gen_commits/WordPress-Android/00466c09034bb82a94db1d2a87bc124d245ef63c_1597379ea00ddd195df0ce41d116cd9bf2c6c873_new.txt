feat: Add fade animations to stats fragment transitions

Implement fade-in and fade-out animations when switching between
child fragments in the stats paged views. This enhances the user
experience by providing a smoother visual transition.
Set a minimum height on the fragment container to prevent layout
jumps during the animation.
