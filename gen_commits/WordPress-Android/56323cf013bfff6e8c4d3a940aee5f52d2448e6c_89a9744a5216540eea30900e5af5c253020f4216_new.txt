refactor: Streamline Reader post detail UI state updates

- The ReaderPostDetailFragment no longer directly manages its coroutine scope or launches coroutines for `onShowPost`.
- Coroutine launching for fetching posts is now handled within the ReaderPostDetailViewModel.
- Consolidated post-loading UI update logic (analytics, navigation events, UI state update) into a new `updatePostDetailsUi()` method in the ViewModel.
- The Fragment's `onPostExecuteShowPost` is now called during `renderUiState`, ensuring UI elements are updated reactively based on the ViewModel's state.
- This improves separation of concerns and clarifies responsibilities between the Fragment and ViewModel.
