test(e2e): Add Dashboard Domains card assertion

This commit introduces a new End-to-End test to verify the presence and content of the "Find a custom domain" card on the My Sites Dashboard.

Changes include:
- A new `DashboardTests.kt` file with a test case that asserts the domains card.
- A new `assertDomainsCard()` method in `MySitesPage.kt` to perform the UI assertions.
- Enabling the `dashboard_card_domain` feature flag in the mock API responses.
- Adding a mock for the `/rest/v1.1/sites/<site_id>/domains/` endpoint.
- Updating an existing mock site configuration to ensure necessary capabilities.
