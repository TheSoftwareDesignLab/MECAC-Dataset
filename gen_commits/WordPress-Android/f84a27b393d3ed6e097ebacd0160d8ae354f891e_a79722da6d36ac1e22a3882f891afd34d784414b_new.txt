refactor: Refine layout of Jetpack individual plugin overlay

Reorganize the layout of the `WPJetpackIndividualPluginOverlayScreen`.
This change:
- Introduces `ContentMargin` for consistent horizontal padding.
- Vertically centers the main content (icon, title, description) within a scrollable column using `Arrangement.Center` and a `weight(1f)` modifier.
- Removes previous `Spacer` components used for centering.
- Adjusts the button section's padding for better alignment and consistency with the new layout.
