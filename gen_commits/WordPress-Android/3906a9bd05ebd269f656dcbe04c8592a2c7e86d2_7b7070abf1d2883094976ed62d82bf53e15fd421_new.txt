fix(ui): Standardize text alignment across UI elements

Explicitly set `android:textAlignment="viewStart"` and `android:gravity="start"`
(or `center_vertical|start`) for various text-based UI components in several
layout files. This ensures text alignment consistently respects the UI's
layout direction, improving display in Right-To-Left (RTL) locales and
overall UI consistency.
