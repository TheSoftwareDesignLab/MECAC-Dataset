refactor(reader): Improve update state and progress indicator logic

Replaces `mIsUpdating` boolean with a `HashSet` to track multiple concurrent
`UpdateAction` types. This allows the Reader post list to correctly manage
and display progress indicators (bottom spinner, swipe-to-refresh) based
on the specific updates in progress.
