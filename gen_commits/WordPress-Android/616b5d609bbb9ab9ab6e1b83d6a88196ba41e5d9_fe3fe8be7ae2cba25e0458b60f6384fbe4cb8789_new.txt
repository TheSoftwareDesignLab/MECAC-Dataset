fix: Improve domain suggestion item layout

Adjusts `site_creation_domains_item.xml` to enhance the visual alignment and
spacing of elements.
- `domain_suggestion_radio_button` now aligns its bottom with `domain_suggestion`.
- `domain_suggestion` text is re-constrained to span horizontally and align to the top.
- `domain_unavailability` text now spans the full width and aligns to the parent's end.
