feat: Add loading state and dynamic top bar to Jetpack static poster

Introduce `UiState.Loading` to display a circular progress indicator while content loads.
Refactor the `JetpackStaticPoster` composable to conditionally show a top app bar (with back icon) based on the `showTopBar` flag from the UI state.
Remove the dynamic `featureName` in `UiState.Content` and use a static string resource for the poster title.
Add `onPrimaryClick` and `onSecondaryClick` handlers to the `JetpackStaticPosterViewModel` and pass them to the UI.
Consolidate the `Content` composable directly into `JetpackStaticPoster` for a simpler structure.
