fix: Correct image orientation and improve camera capture

Reads image orientation metadata and applies rotations to bitmaps when displaying images and generating thumbnails, resolving orientation issues. Improves camera capture handling for HTC Sense devices to correctly identify captured images.

Bumps application version to 1.1.5 (versionCode 12) and updates User-Agent string. Disables the debuggable flag. Removes unused `ImageFilter`, `XMLRPCMethod`, and `XMLRPCMethodImages` classes from `newPost.java`.
