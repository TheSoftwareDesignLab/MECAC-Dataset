refactor: Adjust default visibility in learn_more_pref.xml

Changed ImageView and TextView visibility from `gone` to `invisible` to retain their allocated space in the layout when hidden.
Added `android:visibility="gone"` to the "Learn more" button to ensure it's initially hidden without occupying space.
