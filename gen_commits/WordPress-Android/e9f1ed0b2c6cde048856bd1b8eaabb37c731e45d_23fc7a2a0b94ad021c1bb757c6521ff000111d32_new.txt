refactor(e2e): Ensure switch preference state via conditional click

Rename `setSwitchPreferenceIsChecked` to `ensureSwitchPreferenceIsChecked` and
update its implementation. The utility now conditionally clicks a switch
preference only if its current state differs from the desired state.
This improves test reliability by more accurately simulating user interaction
and avoiding redundant state changes.
