refactor: Update Visitors & Views graph legend UI

Migrate legend indicators from separate ImageView elements to CheckBox compound drawables.
Adjust graph bar padding and highlight colors for better visual consistency. Standardize legend icon sizes and reduce the corner radius for legend backgrounds. Also, removes obsolete ImageView definitions and unused color.
