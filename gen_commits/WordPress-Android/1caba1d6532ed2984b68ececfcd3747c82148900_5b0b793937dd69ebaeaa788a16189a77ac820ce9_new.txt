chore: Update FluxC dependency and adapt Theme API

Updates the FluxC dependency to its latest version.
This update introduces a change in the `ThemeStore`'s
`getInstalledThemeByThemeId` method signature, which now
requires the site object as an additional parameter.
The code has been adapted to pass the `mSite` instance
to this method for correct theme retrieval.
