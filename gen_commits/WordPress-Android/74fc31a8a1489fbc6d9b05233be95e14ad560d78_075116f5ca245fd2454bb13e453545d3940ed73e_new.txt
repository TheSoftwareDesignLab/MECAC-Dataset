refactor: Make savePostAsync support post-save callbacks

Introduces `AfterSavePostListener` to allow actions to be performed
immediately after an asynchronous post save operation completes.

The `savePostAsync` method now accepts this listener, which is called
once the post has been updated in the database. This refactoring
enables more precise control over post-save actions, such as
reloading the post preview only after the save is confirmed.
Previously, the preview was implicitly reloaded within savePostAsync.
