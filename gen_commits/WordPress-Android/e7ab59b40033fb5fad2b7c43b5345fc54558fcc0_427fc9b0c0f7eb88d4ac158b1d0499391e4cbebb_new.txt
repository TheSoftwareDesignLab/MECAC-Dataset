fix: Ensure TabLayout syncs correctly with ViewPager

Reordered the initialization of TabLayout to prevent its OnPageChangeListener from
being immediately cleared. Calling `clearOnPageChangeListeners` after `setupWithViewPager`
would remove the listener responsible for synchronizing tab selections with ViewPager
page changes, causing the tab layout to not function as expected.
