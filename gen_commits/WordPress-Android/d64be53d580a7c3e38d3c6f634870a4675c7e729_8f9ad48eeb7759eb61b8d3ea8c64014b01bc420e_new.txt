feat: Pass isFinishing flag to Gutenberg content retrieval

Introduces an `isFinishing` flag propagated from `EditPostActivity` to
`GutenbergKitEditorFragment` when retrieving post content for saving.
This enables the Gutenberg editor to handle content extraction
differently when the activity is finishing, ensuring all text
composition and pending changes are finalized for a complete save.

Updates the gutenberg-kit dependency.
