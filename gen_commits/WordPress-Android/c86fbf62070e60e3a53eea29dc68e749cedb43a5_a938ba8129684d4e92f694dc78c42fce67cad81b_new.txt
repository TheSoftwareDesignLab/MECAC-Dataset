feat: Display 'No activity this period' for empty stats graphs

Introduces a visual message and disables graph interaction when no data is available for the selected period in the stats bar graph.

Also, refactors `StatsBarGraph.onTouchEvent` to ensure the gesture detector is called only if the event is handled by the superclass and the detector is not null, improving event handling robustness.
