refactor(navigation): Use navigateToSafe across UI fragments

Replaced direct `navigateTo` calls with `navigateToSafe` in `ListsFragment` and
`MovieDetailsFragment`. This ensures navigation actions are performed only when
the fragment is in a valid state, preventing crashes from multiple rapid clicks
or invalid states.

Added `navigationId` override to `ListsFragment` for consistent navigation management.
