feat: Improve title EditText behavior and cursor control

The title input field now hides its cursor by default. It becomes visible
upon clicking the EditText and is hidden again when the "Done" action
is triggered from the soft keyboard. Additionally, the input type has
been updated to be single-line, removing the `textMultiLine` attribute.
