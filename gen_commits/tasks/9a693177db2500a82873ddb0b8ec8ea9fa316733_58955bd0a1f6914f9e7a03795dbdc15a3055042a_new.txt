refactor: Navigation drawer actions and padding adjustments

- Relocate drawer action buttons (Purchase, Help, Settings) to the header,
  appearing next to the search bar.
- Hide these action buttons when the search bar is focused to improve search
  UI clarity.
- Move "Customize drawer" option from the main drawer list to a dedicated
  preference screen.
- Refactor system gesture padding application directly to the LazyColumn's
  content padding for `TaskListDrawer`.
- Update relevant strings from "Manage drawer" to "Customize drawer".
