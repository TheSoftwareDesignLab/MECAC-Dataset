fix: Use database's current time for default task order

The previous implementation used `DateUtilities.now()` to insert a fixed Java timestamp into the SQL sort expression. This meant the "current time" component of the sort was static upon query generation.

Switching to `Functions.now()` ensures the `now()` SQL function is directly embedded in the query, allowing the database to dynamically calculate the current time at query execution for a more accurate and up-to-date default sorting.
