feat: Toggle quick-add controls visibility based on focus

Quick-add controls now appear only when the quick-add input box is in
focus and hide when it loses focus. This provides a cleaner UI and
reduces clutter when not actively adding a task.

Touching the task list will clear focus from the quick-add box, hiding
the controls and the soft keyboard.
