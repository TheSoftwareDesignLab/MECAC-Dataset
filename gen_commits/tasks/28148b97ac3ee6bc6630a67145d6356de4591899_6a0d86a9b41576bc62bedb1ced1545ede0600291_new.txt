fix: Handle TaskRabbit assignment distinctly in edit people control

Corrects behavior in `EditPeopleControlSet` to prevent implicitly assigning 'Nobody'
when the TaskRabbit option is selected. Instead of resetting the selection,
it now returns, treating TaskRabbit selection as a specific action.

Refactors `TaskAdapter` to retrieve `TaskRabbitTaskContainer` via
`TaskRabbitDataService.getInstance()` for centralized data management.

Also includes minor UI padding adjustments for task list item images.
