fix(notes): Prevent adding empty update comments

Update comments without content are now prevented from being added to the list and displayed, avoiding visual clutter.

Additionally, tab indicator text colors are now defined via theme attributes (asTextColor, vpiTabTextStyle) instead of hardcoded values, improving theme consistency. The custom_tab_indicator_dark_selected.9.png asset was also updated.
