refactor: Migrate existing widget configurations on app upgrade

Introduces a migration step for app version V8_10 to update preferences for
all existing widgets. This ensures consistency with updated defaults and
simplifies widget preference handling.

The migration applies the following configuration changes to existing widgets:
* Aligns header and footer opacity with row opacity.
* Sets due date position based on previous visibility setting.
* Disables dividers and menu by default.
* Sets spacing to a compact layout.
* Disables task description visibility.
* Refactors opacity getters for cleaner preference retrieval.
