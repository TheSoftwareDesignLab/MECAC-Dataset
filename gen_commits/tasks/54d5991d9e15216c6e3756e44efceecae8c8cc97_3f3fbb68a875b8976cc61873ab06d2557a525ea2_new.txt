refactor: Improve app widget reconfiguration flexibility

Renamed `reconfigureWidget` to `reconfigureWidgets` in `AppWidgetManager`.
The method now accepts a variable number of widget IDs, defaulting to
reconfiguring all widgets if no IDs are provided.

Updated `LocalBroadcastManager` and `Tasks` to use the new method,
and now reconfigure all widgets during app initialization.
