fix: Handle negative completion dates as uncompleted

Changes `COMPLETION_DATE.eq(0)` to `COMPLETION_DATE.lte(0)` when adjusting
queries for tasks, specifically in the context of showing recently
completed tasks. This ensures that any task with a negative or zero
completion date is correctly treated as uncompleted.
