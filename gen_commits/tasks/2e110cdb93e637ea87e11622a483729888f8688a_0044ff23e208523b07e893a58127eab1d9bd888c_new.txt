refactor: Remove user name field from Person View header

The TextView for displaying the user's name has been removed from the PersonViewFragment and the task_list_body_user.xml layout.
The user's subtitle is now aligned with the user image.
Adjusted header padding and image margin from 5dip to 8dip for better visual balance.
