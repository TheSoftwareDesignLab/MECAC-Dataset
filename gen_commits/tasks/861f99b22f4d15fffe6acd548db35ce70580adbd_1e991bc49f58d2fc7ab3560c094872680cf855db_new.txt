refactor: Improve task row layout and hidden status display

The 'hidden task' indicator is now rendered as a compound drawable within the task title TextView, removing the dedicated ImageView.

This change also refactors row padding logic to dynamically adjust bottom spacing based on the visibility of description and chip group elements, ensuring consistent visual spacing. New color resources for drawable tinting are introduced.
