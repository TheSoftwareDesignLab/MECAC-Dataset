feat: Implement navigation drawer list reordering

Adds a new activity `NavigationDrawerCustomization` to allow users to
reorder custom filters, tags, Google Tasks lists, and CalDAV calendars
via drag-and-drop.

Includes a 'Reset sort order' option. The underlying drag-and-drop and
reactive diffing logic has been refactored into a reusable
`DragAndDropDiffer` interface, also applied to the task list adapter.
