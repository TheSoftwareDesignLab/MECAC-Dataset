refactor: Consolidate notification fragment setup

Moves notification fragment loading from TaskListActivity's intent handling
into a FilterWithCustomIntent. The Notifications class now directly specifies
NotificationFragment as the custom list component for task notifications.

This change removes source-based conditional fragment loading in
TaskListActivity and simplifies NotificationFragment's filter population logic.
NotificationFragment now also cleans up its filter from the adapter on detach.
