refactor: Update Beast Mode preferences to use Toolbar

Migrated BeastModePreferences to AppCompatActivity. Implemented a Toolbar for navigation and actions, moving the "Reset to defaults" functionality to a menu item. Updated AppearancePreferences to trigger an activity restart when Beast Mode order changes. Removed old UI elements and string resources.
