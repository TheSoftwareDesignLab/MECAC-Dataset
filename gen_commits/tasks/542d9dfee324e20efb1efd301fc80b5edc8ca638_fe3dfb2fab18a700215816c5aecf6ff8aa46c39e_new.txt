feat: Improve task creation from context and widget

Centralizes task creation with initial values into `TaskListActivity.createWithValues`.
Allows `TaskEditActivity` to receive `ContentValues` for new task initialization, particularly from widgets.
Ensures Producteev metadata is always initialized, preventing null pointer exceptions during task editing.
Fixes an issue where tags were attempted to be loaded for unsaved tasks.
Updates widget layout dimensions and passes filter context more robustly.
