fix: Align comment and timer button visibility with text input

The TextWatcher for the commentField was moved to always be active,
ensuring the comment button's visibility consistently updates with text input.
The timer view's visibility logic within the TextWatcher is now conditional
on the 'show timer shortcut' preference, preventing it from appearing
or disappearing when the shortcut is disabled. This resolves an
inconsistent UI behavior where the comment button's visibility
was not dynamically updated if the timer shortcut was off.
