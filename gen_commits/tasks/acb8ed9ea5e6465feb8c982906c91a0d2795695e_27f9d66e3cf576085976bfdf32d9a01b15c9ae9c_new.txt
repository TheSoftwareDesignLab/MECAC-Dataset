fix: Convert legacy theme colors during backup import

Ensures theme color compatibility when importing backups from older
versions (< V8_2). Previously, theme colors were stored as indices,
but newer versions expect actual Android color values.

This change:
- Converts old theme indices to Android colors for tags, Google task lists,
  filters, Caldav calendars, and the main theme preference during import.
- Makes `Upgrader.V8_2` and `Upgrader.getAndroidColor` public static
  to facilitate this conversion from TasksJsonImporter.
