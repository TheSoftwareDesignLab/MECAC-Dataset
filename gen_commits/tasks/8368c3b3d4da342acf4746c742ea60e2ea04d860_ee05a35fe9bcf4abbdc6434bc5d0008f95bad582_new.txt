feat: Add subtask expand/collapse toggle to widget

Introduces a new button in the task widget rows for tasks with subtasks.
This button allows users to expand or collapse a task's subtasks directly
from the widget. The button displays the count of subtasks and an icon
reflecting the current expanded/collapsed state. The state is persisted
and the widget is refreshed upon interaction.
