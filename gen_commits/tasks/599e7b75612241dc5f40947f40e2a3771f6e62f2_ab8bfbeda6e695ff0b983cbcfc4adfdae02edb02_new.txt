feat: Implement list deletion and leaving functionality

Adds "Delete List" and "Leave List" buttons to Tag Settings, allowing users to remove owned lists or leave shared lists after confirmation.

- Updates `TagData.getPictureHash` to use ID instead of NAME for improved uniqueness.
- Changes Tag Settings title to a generic "List Settings" for consistency.
- Enhances `PeopleContainer` to display appropriate icons for existing members versus add-contact slots.
- Introduces new drawable assets (`icn_add_contact.png`, `icn_list_shortcut.png`).
- Modifies `TaskListActivity` to handle tag deletion broadcasts, refreshing the filter list or switching to active tasks.
- Adds new styles for the delete/leave button and updates theme attributes.
