style: Migrate hints to TextInputLayout for floating labels

Moves the 'android:hint' attribute from TextInputEditText to its parent TextInputLayout across various settings screens and input forms. This change leverages the Material Design floating label feature, improving the user experience by making hints persistent when text is entered.

Also updates the 'TagSettingsRow' style to correctly inherit from 'Widget.Design.TextInputLayout' to ensure proper hint behavior.
