refactor: Remove proof text and simplify UUID generation

The `PROOF_TEXT` property and its associated complex bcrypt-based generation logic have been entirely removed. UUIDs are now generated using a simpler mechanism based on `UUID.randomUUID().getLeastSignificantBits()`. This streamlines the UUID generation process and removes unnecessary complexity related to device IDs and proof text. All related database columns, sync mappings, and test assertions have been eliminated.
