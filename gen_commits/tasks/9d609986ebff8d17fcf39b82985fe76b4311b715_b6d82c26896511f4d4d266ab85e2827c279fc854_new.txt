refactor: Unify widget logic into a single implementation

Merged the functionality of ScrollableTasksWidget and ScrollableWidgetConfigActivity directly into TasksWidget and WidgetConfigActivity. This eliminates redundant code and simplifies widget management across all Android API levels by providing a single, unified update mechanism. References to widget updates throughout the application now interact directly with TasksWidget.
