feat: Broadcast tag rename events and auto-refresh UI

Introduces `BROADCAST_EVENT_TAG_RENAMED` to notify listeners of tag name changes.
`TagService` now sends this broadcast after a tag is renamed.
`TaskListActivity` registers a receiver to refresh task and filter lists when this event occurs.
Also, refined tag deletion dialog to accurately detect shared tags with members using `TagMetadataDao`.
