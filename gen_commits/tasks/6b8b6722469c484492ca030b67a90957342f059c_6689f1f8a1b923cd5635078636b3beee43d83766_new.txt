refactor: Remove redundant and unused themes

Eliminated several legacy theme styles, including Theme_White_Alt, Theme_Transparent, Theme_White_Blue, and Theme_TransparentWhite. Removed associated theme-specific drawables, widget layouts, and conditional logic. This simplifies the codebase by consolidating theme handling and reducing maintenance overhead.
