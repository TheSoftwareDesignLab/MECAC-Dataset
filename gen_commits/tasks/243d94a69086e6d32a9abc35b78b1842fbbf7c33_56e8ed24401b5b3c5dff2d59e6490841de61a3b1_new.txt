feat: Dark blue theme and refactored camera button styling

Removed `asCameraButtonImg` theme attribute, directly referencing `camera_button_gray` drawable.
Introduced a new "dark blue" theme variant with dedicated assets for various UI elements and tab indicators.
Added `asAbBackgroundColor` attribute for more flexible background styling.
