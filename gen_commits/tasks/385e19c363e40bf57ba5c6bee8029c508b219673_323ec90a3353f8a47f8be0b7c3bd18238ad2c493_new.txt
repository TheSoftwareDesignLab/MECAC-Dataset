feat: Refactor widget configuration to PreferenceActivity

Replaced the custom `WidgetConfigDialog` fragment with a dedicated `WidgetConfigActivity` based on Android's Preference framework. This provides a more standard and robust settings experience for widgets.

Key changes include:
- `WidgetConfigActivity` now extends `InjectingPreferenceActivity` and uses `preferences_widget.xml`.
- Introduced `WidgetPreferences` helper class to centralize widget-specific preference management.
- `SeekBarDialog` was updated to use a callback interface for direct communication with the parent activity.
- The `WidgetConfigActivity` is now excluded from recents and has a proper label.
