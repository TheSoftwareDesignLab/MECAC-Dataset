feat(widget): Introduce custom sorting and recently completed tasks

This commit enhances task widgets with dedicated sorting and display features:

*   **Widget-Specific Sorting:** A new `SORT_WIDGET` option and default sort order are introduced for widgets, prioritizing tasks by due date and importance.
*   **Recently Completed Tasks:** Widgets now automatically include tasks completed within the last minute using `FLAG_SHOW_RECENTLY_COMPLETED`.
*   **UI Improvement:** Completed tasks in widgets are now rendered with a strikethrough.
*   **Refactoring:** The logic for constructing the widget's task query, including applying sort flags and order, has been moved from `WidgetHelper` to `ScrollableViewsFactory`. The `Filter` object is now passed directly to the widget service.
