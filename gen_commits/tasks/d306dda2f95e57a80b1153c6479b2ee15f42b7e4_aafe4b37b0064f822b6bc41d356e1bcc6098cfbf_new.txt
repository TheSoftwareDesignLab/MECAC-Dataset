fix: Ensure selected white color is visible in light themes

Previously, selecting white as a theme color in light mode resulted in poor
visibility as it blended with the background. This commit adjusts white colors
to black (or a highly contrasting dark equivalent) when in a light theme.

Additionally:
- The color selection row now displays the theme-adjusted color.
- Color constants (WHITE, BLACK) are centralized in kmp/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/tasks/themes/ColorProvider.kt.
- GREY_900 has been removed from the color palette.
