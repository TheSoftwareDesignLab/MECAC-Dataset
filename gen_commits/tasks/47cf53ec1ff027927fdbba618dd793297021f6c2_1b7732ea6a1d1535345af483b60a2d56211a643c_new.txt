feat: Delay widget updates until sync completes

Introduce a mechanism to suppress widget updates during active synchronization
processes. A `SyncResultCallbackWrapper` is used to set a flag in `TasksWidget`
when sync starts, preventing updates for up to 5 minutes. The flag is reset
and widgets are refreshed once the synchronization finishes.

This prevents widgets from displaying potentially stale or inconsistent data
mid-sync and reduces unnecessary update cycles.
