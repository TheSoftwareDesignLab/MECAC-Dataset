refactor: Optimize task row layout and detail rendering

Reworked `task_adapter_row.xml` to use `RelativeLayout` for improved positioning flexibility. Consolidated task details into a single `TextView` and introduced caching for better performance. Dynamically adjusts heights of completion checkbox and importance bar. Updated text sizes for task details and due date.
