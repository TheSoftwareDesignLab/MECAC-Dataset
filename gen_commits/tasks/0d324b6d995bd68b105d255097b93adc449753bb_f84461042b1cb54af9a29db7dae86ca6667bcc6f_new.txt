perf: Reduce TaskListPager offscreen limit

Reduced the `ViewPager`'s offscreen page limit from 3 to 1 for the
task list pager. This optimizes memory usage and potentially improves
performance when swiping between task lists.

The A/B test key for swipe navigation was updated from `v2` to `v3`,
likely in preparation for testing this or related performance
improvements for the swipe experience.
