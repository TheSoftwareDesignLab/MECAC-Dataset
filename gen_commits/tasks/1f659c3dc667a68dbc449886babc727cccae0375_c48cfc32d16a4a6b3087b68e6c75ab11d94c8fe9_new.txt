feat: Migrate to Material3 adaptive list-detail scaffold

Replaces the legacy XML master/detail layout with Jetpack Compose Material3 `ListDetailPaneScaffold`. This provides a modern and adaptive UI experience across various screen sizes and form factors.

Key changes:
- Integrates `androidx.compose.material3.adaptive` libraries.
- `MainActivity` uses `ListDetailPaneScaffold` to host `TaskListFragment` and `TaskEditFragment`.
- `TaskEditViewModel` now loads task-related data (list, location, tags, alarms) directly, simplifying fragment arguments.
- Centralized back button handling in `MainActivity` and `TaskEditScreen`.
- Removes obsolete `task_list_activity.xml` layouts and `two_pane_layout` boolean.
- Updates widget intents to use `FINISH_AFFINITY` for improved navigation.
