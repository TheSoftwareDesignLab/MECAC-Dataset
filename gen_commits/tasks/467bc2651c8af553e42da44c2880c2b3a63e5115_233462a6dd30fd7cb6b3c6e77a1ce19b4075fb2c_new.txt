feat: Integrate time duration control with task properties

`TimeDurationControlSet` can now be initialized with a `Task` model and an `IntegerProperty`. It automatically updates the specified task property when its duration value changes. This streamlines the process of editing time-related properties on tasks directly through the control set.

Also, improves text visibility in dialogs by setting button and number picker text colors to black, ensuring better contrast.
