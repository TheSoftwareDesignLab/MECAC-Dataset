feat: Add conditional row divider and update task row background

Introduces a new custom attribute `horizontal_divider` to control the visibility
of a bottom divider in task rows. The divider is set to be visible specifically
for the black theme to enhance visual separation between tasks.

Additionally, sets the task row background to `?android:colorBackground` for
improved thematic consistency and refines the black theme's window background.
