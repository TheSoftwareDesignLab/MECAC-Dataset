refactor: Rename 'Theme' styles to 'Tasks' for clarity

Renamed Android XML theme styles and all their references in Java code and the AndroidManifest.xml.
Old style names like `R.style.Theme` and `R.style.Theme_White` have been updated to `R.style.Tasks` and `R.style.Tasks_Light`, respectively.
This change improves clarity by using more descriptive names for the application's main themes.
