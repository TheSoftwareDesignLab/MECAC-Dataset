feat(share): Improve task creation from shared intent content

Centralize logic for task creation from ACTION_SEND and ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE
intents.

When sharing content to create a task:
- If Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT is provided and not blank, it is used as the task
  title and Intent.EXTRA_TEXT becomes the task notes.
- If Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT is missing or blank, Intent.EXTRA_TEXT is now
  used as the task title. This ensures tasks created from shared text
  content have a meaningful title even without an explicit subject.
