refactor: Improve RTL support and modernize layout attributes

- Replaced `Gravity.LEFT` with `Gravity.START` for layout direction awareness.
- Introduced `start` and `end` layout, padding, drawable, and alignment attributes in XML for RTL compatibility.
- Cleaned up unused prefix string in `TimeDurationControlSet`.
- Adjusted `due_date` and `tag_block` positioning in `task_adapter_row_simple.xml`.
