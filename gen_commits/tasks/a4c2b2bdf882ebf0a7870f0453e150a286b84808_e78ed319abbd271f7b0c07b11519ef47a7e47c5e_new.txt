fix: Adjust subtask drag and drop target index calculation

Corrects the target position calculation when an item is dragged downwards in a DraggableListView, ensuring the item is dropped at the intended location. Previously, the index might be off by one.

Also removes numerous `System.err.println` debug statements from various files, improves logic for dropping items at the end of a list, and applies minor padding adjustments.
