refactor: Convert TasksWidget to Kotlin and use coroutines for filters

The `TasksWidget` class has been fully migrated from Java to Kotlin. This change also includes modernizing filter retrieval operations across widget-related components:

*   Replaced blocking `DefaultFilterProvider.getFilterFromPreferenceBlocking()` calls with suspendable `getFilterFromPreference()`.
*   Introduced `lifecycleScope.launch` in `ScrollableWidget` for UI operations that depend on suspend functions.
*   Used `runBlocking` in `ScrollableViewsFactory` and `TasksWidget` to adapt suspend functions to non-suspending contexts (e.g., `onDataSetChanged`, `createScrollableWidget`).

This improves the responsiveness of widget-related operations by ensuring filter lookups are performed asynchronously.
