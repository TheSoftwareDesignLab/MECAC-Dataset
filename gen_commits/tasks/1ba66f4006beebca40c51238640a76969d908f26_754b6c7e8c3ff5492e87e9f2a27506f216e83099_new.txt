refactor(nb): Standardize terminology and punctuation

Improve consistency and natural language flow in Norwegian translations.
- Standardized terms like "notifikasjoner" to "merknader", "tag" to "etikett", "chip" to "flis", and "ugjennomsiktighet" to "dekkevne".
- Fixed various punctuation inconsistencies, including changing exclamation marks to periods and removing unnecessary backslashes before question marks.
