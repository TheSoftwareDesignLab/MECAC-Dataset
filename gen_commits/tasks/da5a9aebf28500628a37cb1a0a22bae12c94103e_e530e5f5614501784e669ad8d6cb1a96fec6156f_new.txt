feat: Allow draggable subtasks in tag views

Introduces the ability to toggle a tag view into a drag-and-drop subtask list.
This switches the underlying fragment to a `SubtasksTagListFragment`, allowing task reordering.
The sort options dialog now dynamically checks if the current view supports drag-and-drop.
