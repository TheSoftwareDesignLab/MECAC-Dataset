feat: Prune invalid collapsed sections from widget

Ensures that the list of collapsed sections in widget preferences only contains sections that still exist in the current task data. This prevents issues where stale or non-existent sections might be marked as collapsed.

Also refactors `WidgetPreferences` instantiation in `ScrollableViewsFactory` to be a class member for minor optimization.
