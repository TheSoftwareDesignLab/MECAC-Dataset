feat: Implement swipe to delete for custom filters

This change introduces swipe-to-delete functionality for custom filter items in the settings activity.
Swiping an item left or right will now remove it from the list. This replaces the previous delete option found within the item's edit dialog, streamlining the user experience.
The swipe action provides a visual indicator with a red background.
