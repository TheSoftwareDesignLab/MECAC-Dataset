feat: Add shared indicator to filter list items

Introduces a visual icon to denote shared filter lists in the list view.
The 'shared' status is determined for CalDAV calendars by checking for associated principals.

- Adds `shared` boolean property to `FilterListItem`.
- Updates `FilterViewHolder` to display `ic_outline_people_outline_24` when a filter is shared.
- Modifies `CaldavDao` and `CaldavFilters` to query and propagate the shared status.
- Adjusts the `filter_adapter_row` layout to position the new indicator.
