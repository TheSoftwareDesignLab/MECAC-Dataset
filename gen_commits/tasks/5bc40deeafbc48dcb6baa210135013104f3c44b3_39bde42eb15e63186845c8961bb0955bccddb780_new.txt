fix: Correct repeat days initialization and sharing message saving

The repeat control set now only initializes the "days of week" checkboxes when a task has an existing due date, preventing incorrect UI state for tasks without a due date.

The sharing message field is now correctly captured and included in the sharing settings JSON within `EditPeopleControlSet.saveSharingSettings`, consolidating message handling and removing redundant logic from `PeopleContainer`.
