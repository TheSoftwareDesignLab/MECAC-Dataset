refactor(bg): Improve Bulgarian translation and add new strings

Corrected grammar and phrasing for several default preference titles (e.g., "Подразбиран X" to "X по подразбиране"). Made some phrases more concise and direct. Standardized terms like "Изтрий" to "Премахване" and "Копирай" to "Копиране". Added new strings for various UI elements.
