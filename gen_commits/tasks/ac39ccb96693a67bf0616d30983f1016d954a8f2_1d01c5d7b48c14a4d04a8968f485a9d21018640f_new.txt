refactor: Modernize TaskEditFragment title and completion UI

Removes EditTitleControlSet and integrates task title editing and completion directly into TaskEditFragment.

This refactors the TaskEditFragment by:
- Replacing the standalone title control set with a title EditText within a CollapsingToolbarLayout.
- Introducing a FloatingActionButton to toggle task completion.
- Consolidating title and completion state management, including keyboard handling and strike-through.
- Simplifying inter-fragment communication by removing now-obsolete callbacks for priority and repeat changes.
