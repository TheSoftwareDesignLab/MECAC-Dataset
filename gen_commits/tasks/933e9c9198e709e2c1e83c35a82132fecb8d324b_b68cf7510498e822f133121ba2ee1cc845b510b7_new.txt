feat: Limit number of subtasks displayed in widget

The subtask query in the Tasks Widget now includes a `LIMIT` clause,
using the `numberOfTasks` variable. This change ensures that the
widget only fetches and displays a controlled number of subtasks,
improving performance and preventing excessive list lengths.
