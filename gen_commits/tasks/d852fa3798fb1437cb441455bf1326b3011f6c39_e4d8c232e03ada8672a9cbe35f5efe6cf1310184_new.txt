fix(cs): Improve Czech translation for backup and geofence

Updates several string resources in `values-cs/strings.xml` for better clarity and accuracy.
- Clarifies backup terminology for import, export, and Google Drive.
- Corrects `geofence_radius` from "Přesnost" (Accuracy) to "Průměr" (Diameter).
