refactor: Update task intent creation to use objects

Refactor intent generation in `TaskIntents` and `TasksWidget` to use `Filter` and `Task` objects directly instead of string or long IDs. This improves type safety and robustness.

- Removes ID-based `getNewTaskIntent` and `getEditTaskIntent` from `TaskIntents`.
- Introduces `getEditTaskIntent(context, Filter, Task)` for object-based intent creation.
- Updates `TasksWidget` to asynchronously fetch `Task` objects when needed for editing.
- Uses `MainActivity.OPEN_NEW_TASK` with a `Task` object for editing and `MainActivity.OPEN_TASK` with `0L` for new tasks.
