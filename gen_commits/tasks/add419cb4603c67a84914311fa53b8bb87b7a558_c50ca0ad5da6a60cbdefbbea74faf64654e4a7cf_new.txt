feat: Make widget headers theme-aware

Refactor AdapterSection.headerColor to accept an optional default text color.
This allows the ScrollableViewsFactory to set appropriate header text colors
(white_60 for dark mode, black_60 for light mode) for widget sections,
improving theme compatibility and readability.
