feat: Replace bottom sheet drawer with modal navigation drawer

This refactors the task list drawer in `MainActivity` from a `ModalBottomSheet` to a `ModalNavigationDrawer` for improved user experience and adherence to Material Design guidelines.

- Migrates `MainActivity` to utilize `ModalNavigationDrawer` and `ModalDrawerSheet`.
- Updates `MainActivityViewModel` to manage the drawer's open/closed state.
- Implements system window insets for `TaskListFragment`'s toolbars and the `detailPane` for correct layout.
- Adds `imePadding` to `TaskListDrawer` for better keyboard handling.
