refactor: Remove custom task list class mapping

Eliminates the mechanism for dynamically associating custom TaskList
classes with specific filters. The `customTaskLists` HashMap and all
related `setCustomTaskListForFilter`, `clearCustomTaskListForFilter`,
and `showFilterWithCustomTaskList` methods have been removed.

This simplifies the filter presentation and management logic within the
TaskListFragmentPagerAdapter and related components. Subtask-specific
custom list handling remains, as it's a hardcoded exception.

Additionally, this commit ensures that any lingering filter query
overrides are cleared when a TaskListFragment is initialized, preventing
unintended filtering behavior (e.g., a search query persisting on Inbox).
