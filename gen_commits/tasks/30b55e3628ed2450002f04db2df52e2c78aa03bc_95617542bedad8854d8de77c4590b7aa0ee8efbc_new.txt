refactor: Generalize UI element styling with theme attributes

Replaced hardcoded drawable and color references with theme attributes for
popover backgrounds, list backgrounds, separator lines, and arrow icons.
This enables easier customization and theming across different UI
components and prepares for additional theme variants.
