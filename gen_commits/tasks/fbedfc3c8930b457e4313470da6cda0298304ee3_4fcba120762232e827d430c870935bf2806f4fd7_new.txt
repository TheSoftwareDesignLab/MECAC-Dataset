refactor: Streamline styling and dialog creation

Refactor AlertDialog message setting from `newDialog(int resId)` to `newDialog().setMessage(int resId)` for consistency across multiple dialogs.
Simplify text color management by removing explicit `android:textColor` attributes from various layouts, relying on theme defaults.
Update `ViewHolder` to manage task name color/state via `setEnabled` instead of direct `setTextColor`, removing `textColorPrimary` dependency.
Inject `Theme` into `PurchaseAdapter` to enable theme-aware layout inflation.
Increment `versionCode` to 603.
