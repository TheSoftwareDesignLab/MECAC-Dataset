feat: Add system default theme option for widgets

Introduces a new "System Default" theme option for widgets, allowing them to
automatically adapt to the device's system dark or light mode settings.

Key changes:
- Widgets can now be configured to follow the system's UI mode.
- The widget factory dynamically reconfigures the widget when the system
  theme changes if the "System Default" option is selected.
- The default widget theme is now set to "System Default".
