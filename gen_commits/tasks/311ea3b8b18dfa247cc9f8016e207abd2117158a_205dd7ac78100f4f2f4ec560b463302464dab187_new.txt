feat: Add swipe gestures to indent/outdent subtasks

Implements swipe left/right gestures on subtask list items to
outdent and indent them respectively.

Subtasks are now visually indented in the list based on their
indentation level.

Refactors DraggableListView by removing the deprecated "remove mode"
and its associated visual effects, simplifying the drag-and-drop
and swipe detection logic. The subtask query generation was also
improved to avoid redundant joins.
