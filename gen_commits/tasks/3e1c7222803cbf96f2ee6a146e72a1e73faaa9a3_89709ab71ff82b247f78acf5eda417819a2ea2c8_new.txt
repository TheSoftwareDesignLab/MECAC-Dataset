refactor: Streamline sync and UI refresh logic

Removes the `BG_SYNC` flag, simplifying background synchronization triggering.
Refactors `TagViewFragment`'s `refreshData` method, eliminating the 'manual' parameter and improving UI callback handling.
Enhances `reloadTagData` in `TagViewFragment` to apply specific refresh behavior based on `onActivityResult` calls.
Ensures members gallery views are correctly cleared and prevents displaying empty picture URLs.
Explicitly broadcasts a refresh event after background syncs initiated by `ActFmSyncV2Provider`.
Includes general code cleanup, removing debug logs and unused comments.
