fix: Improve widget navigation and task save logic

Adds necessary intent flags for widget-launched activities and refines task saving.

- Widgets now use `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` for task list navigation, ensuring a clean stack.
- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` is applied to widget-launched edit activities, preventing crashes when started from a non-Activity context.
- `TaskDao.save` no longer prematurely returns false when an existing task with no new set values is saved.
