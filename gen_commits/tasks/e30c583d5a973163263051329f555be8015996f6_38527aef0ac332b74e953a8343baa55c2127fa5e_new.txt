fix(widget): Ensure widget updates run on main thread

Move appWidgetManager.notifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged to the main thread
(Dispatchers.Main) as it's a UI operation.

Refine widget reconfiguration:
- Reconfigure only the specific widget when pinned.
- Remove redundant updateWidgets call from reconfigureWidgets.
