feat: Add Italian strings for task recurrence

Adds new string resources for the Italian localization (`values-it/strings.xml`).
These strings support task repetition and custom recurrence options, including "Never", "Custom recurrence", "Repeats every", "Repeats weekly/monthly", and recurrence ending conditions.
