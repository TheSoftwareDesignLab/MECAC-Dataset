fix: Draggable list items now wrap content height

Removes fixed height calculations (e.g., mItemHeightNormal, computeMinRowHeight)
for draggable list rows. Items will now use LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT,
allowing them to dynamically adjust their height based on their content.
This improves layout flexibility and prevents content truncation.
