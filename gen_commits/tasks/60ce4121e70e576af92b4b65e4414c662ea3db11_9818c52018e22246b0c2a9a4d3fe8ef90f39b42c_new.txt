fix: Lazily add Updates tab in TagViewActivity

Refactors how the "Updates" tab is added to TagViewActivity. The tab is now
added conditionally and only once when refreshUpdatesList() is called,
ensuring the user is logged in and the tag has a remote ID. This prevents
premature or duplicate tab additions, improving UI stability.

Also updates the "Specific Day/Time" urgency string to "Specific Day".
