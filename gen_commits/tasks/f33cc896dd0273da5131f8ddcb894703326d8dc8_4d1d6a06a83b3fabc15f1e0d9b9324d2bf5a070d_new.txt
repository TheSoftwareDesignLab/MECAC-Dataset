refactor: Streamline and modernize widget architecture

Refactored widget update services and view factories for improved
maintainability and clarity. Consolidated widget settings into data classes
(WidgetHeaderSettings, WidgetRowSettings) and introduced RemoteViews
extension functions for consistent styling.

This change also removes deprecated widget preferences and associated UI
strings, and consolidates various widget layout files, reducing code
duplication and simplifying widget configuration. Widgets now reconfigure
automatically on system configuration changes.
