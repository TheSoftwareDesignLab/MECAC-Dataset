feat: Add scale animation for task checkbox interactions

Introduces a subtle scale animation on the task completion checkbox when its state changes. This provides immediate visual feedback to the user upon tapping the checkbox.
The `btn_check` drawable XML was also simplified by removing redundant pressed states.
