refactor(nl): Clarify reminder settings strings

Renamed `rmd_EPr_rmd_time_title` text from "Standaard herinnering" to "Herinneringstijd" for better specificity.
Added new string `default_reminder` for the general "Standaard Herinnering" concept.
Added `rmd_time_description` to provide context for reminder time settings.
These changes improve consistency and clarity in the Dutch localization for reminder configurations.
