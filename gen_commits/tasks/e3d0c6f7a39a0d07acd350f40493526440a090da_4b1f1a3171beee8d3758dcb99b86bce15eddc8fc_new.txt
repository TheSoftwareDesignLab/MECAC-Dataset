feat: Implement configurable widget header spacing and height

Introduces a new preference to customize widget header spacing.
This allows users to choose between default, compact, or no-height header
options, dynamically adjusting the header's overall height and its title
layout.

Vertical padding for header buttons (change list, add task, settings)
now adapts based on the selected spacing preference.
