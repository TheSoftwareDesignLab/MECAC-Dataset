refactor(ui): Clean up importance button text styling

Replaced magic number (24) with `TEXT_SIZE` constant (18) for importance buttons.
Centralized text size setting to button creation, removing redundant calls in `setImportance`.
Removed explicit text color setting for unselected buttons within `setImportance`.
