refactor(sk): Improve and extend Slovak translations

Corrected various existing translations for better accuracy, clarity, and
consistency across the application. This includes refining terms for
backup actions, sorting methods, importance levels, and widget settings.

Additionally, a significant number of new and previously untranslated
string resources have been added to provide comprehensive localization
for the Slovak language.
