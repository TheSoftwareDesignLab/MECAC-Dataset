refactor: Centralize adding assigned users to list members

The logic for prompting users to add an assigned person to a task's
list (tag) members has been refactored and relocated.

Previously, this logic was embedded within EditPeopleControlSet.java
during task saving. It has now been moved to a new method,
`checkAddTagMember`, within TaskListActivity.java.

This change centralizes the membership prompt, allowing it to be
consistently invoked after task save operations from both
TaskEditFragment and QuickAddBar. It also improves data passing
by explicitly including assigned user's email and ID in intents.
