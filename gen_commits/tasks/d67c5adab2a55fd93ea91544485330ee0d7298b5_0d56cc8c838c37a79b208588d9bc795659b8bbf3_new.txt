refactor: Improve task row layout and completion animation

Refactor `task_adapter_row.xml` by converting the root layout from `LinearLayout` to `RelativeLayout`.
Set a fixed height of `70dip` for task rows to ensure consistent sizing and adjust element positioning for better alignment.
Reduce the scale animation factor for task completion from 1.6x to 1.4x for a subtler visual effect.
