feat: Add DraggableSwipeRefreshLayout to prevent drag conflicts

Introduces a custom SwipeRefreshLayout that allows conditionally disabling
touch event interception via `Flags.TLFP_NO_INTERCEPT_TOUCH`. This prevents
the refresh layout from interfering with drag gestures, such as reordering
tasks within the list, improving overall user experience.

The `task_list_body_subtasks.xml` layout now utilizes this new component.
