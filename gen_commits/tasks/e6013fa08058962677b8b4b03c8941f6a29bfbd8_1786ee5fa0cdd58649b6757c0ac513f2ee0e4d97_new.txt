refactor(welcome): Reorganize login page layout and rename adapter

Reorganized the layout of the welcome walkthrough login page.
Changes include:
- Reordered login buttons (Google, Facebook, Password).
- Adjusted the placement of Terms of Service and Login Later links.

Renamed `ViewPagerAdapter` to `WelcomePagerAdapter` for improved clarity
within the `welcome.tutorial` package, updating all references.
