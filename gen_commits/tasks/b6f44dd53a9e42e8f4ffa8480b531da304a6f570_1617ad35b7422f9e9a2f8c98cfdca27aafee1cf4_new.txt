feat: Revamp importance UI, add new preferences and snooze options

This commit introduces several enhancements:

- **Importance UI Redesign:** Replaced the importance spinner with
  toggle buttons in the task edit view. Importance is now visually
  represented by distinct bullet icons in the task list, moving away
  from background color coding, and labels have been simplified.
- **Customizable Preferences:** Added new user preferences for
  setting the task list font size and the default deadline time
  (in days) for new tasks.
- **Flexible Snooze Options:** The snooze notification dialog now
  allows specifying snooze duration in both hours and minutes.
- Updated application version to 1.11.0 and integrated aTrackDog
  for update tracking.
- Minor UI refinements to task list rows and color scheme.
