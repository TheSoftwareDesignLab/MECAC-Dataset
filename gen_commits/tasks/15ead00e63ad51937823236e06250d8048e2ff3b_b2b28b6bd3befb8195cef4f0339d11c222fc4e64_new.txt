refactor: Use theme attribute for camera button and refine layouts

The camera button image source is now resolved from the `asCameraButtonImg` theme attribute, allowing for better theming support. The `R.drawable.camera_button` drawable XML file has been removed.

Minor UI layout adjustments were made across the login activity, tag updates, task edit, and task list screens to improve spacing, padding, and alignment of input fields and buttons.
