i18n(tr): Refine "reminder" terminology and add new strings

Update Turkish translation for "reminders" from "Hatırlatma" to "Anımsatıcı" for improved accuracy and consistency.
Add translations for new reminder-related UI elements, including custom notifications, snooze states, time units (hours, minutes, days, weeks), and alarm triggers relative to task start/due times.
