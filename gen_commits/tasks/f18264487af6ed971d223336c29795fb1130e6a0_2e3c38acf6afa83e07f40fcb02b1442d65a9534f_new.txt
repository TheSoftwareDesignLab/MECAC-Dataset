refactor: Dynamically update widget settings visibility

The widget settings preference now updates its visibility in `onResume()`.
This ensures the preference accurately reflects the presence of widgets, providing a more responsive user experience if widgets are added or removed while the app is active. Previously, this check was only performed during initial setup.
