feat: Introduce dynamic theming for task edit screen backgrounds

- Migrate TaskEditActivity backgrounds from hardcoded values to theme attributes (`asEditBackground`, `asEditRowBackground`).
- Create `task_edit_background_white.xml` for light themes and adjust `task_edit_background.xml` for dark themes.
- Refactor TaskEditActivity by removing explicit tab management constants, string resources, and simplifying tab display logic.
- Fix MultilineListPreference crash on Android 4.0 emulators with a try-catch block.
- Update `onKeyDown` method signature and usage across relevant activities.
