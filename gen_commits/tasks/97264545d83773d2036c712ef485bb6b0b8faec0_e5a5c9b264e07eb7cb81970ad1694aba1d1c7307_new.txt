fix: Refine due date application to respect task's time

Ensure that when a task's due date is updated, the existing time of day is
only preserved if the task explicitly has a due time.

Previously, the time of day was always carried over from the old due date,
which could result in "all-day" tasks acquiring an unintended time component
when their date was changed.

This change uses `Task.createDueDate` for tasks without a specific time,
setting the due date to the start of the day and correctly maintaining their
"all-day" status.
