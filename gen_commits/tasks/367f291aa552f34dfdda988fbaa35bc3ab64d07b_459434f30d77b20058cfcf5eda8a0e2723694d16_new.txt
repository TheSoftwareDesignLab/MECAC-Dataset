feat: Streamline theme color definitions and lookup

Remove redundant caching of ThemeColor objects from ThemeCache.
Introduce new `theme_` prefixed color resources with day/night variants for better semantic theming.
Update ColorPalettePicker to directly retrieve colors from ThemeColor.COLORS and ThemeColor.LAUNCHER_COLORS arrays.
