fix: Prevent UI updates on detached TaskEditFragment

Guard UI update logic in TaskEditBackgroundLoader's onUiThread()
callback with a check for `getActivity() != null`. This prevents
potential NullPointerExceptions if the fragment is detached
before the background operation completes and attempts to
perform UI-related actions.
