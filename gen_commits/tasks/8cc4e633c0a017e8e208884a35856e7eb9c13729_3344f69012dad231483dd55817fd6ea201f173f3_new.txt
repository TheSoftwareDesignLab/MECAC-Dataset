refactor: Align Disposable lifecycle with fragment's onStart/onStop

Move CompositeDisposable initialization from onResume() to onStart().
This ensures reactive subscriptions are managed across the fragment's
entire visible lifecycle, preventing unnecessary re-initialization
on every onResume() and improving lifecycle adherence.
