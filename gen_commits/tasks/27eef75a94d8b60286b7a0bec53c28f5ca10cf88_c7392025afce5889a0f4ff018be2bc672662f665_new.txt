feat: Track task creation from Wear OS

Added analytics event for tasks created via the Wear OS app.
Refactored `TasksWidgetViewFactory` methods (`getViewAt`, `getItemId`, `buildHeader`, `buildUpdate`) to directly accept `AdapterSection` or `TaskContainer` objects, improving type safety, code clarity, and removing the redundant `getTask` helper method.
