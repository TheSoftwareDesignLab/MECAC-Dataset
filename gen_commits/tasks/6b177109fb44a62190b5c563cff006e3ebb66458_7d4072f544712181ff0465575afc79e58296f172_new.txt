feat: Enhance dialog responsiveness and UI layouts

Introduce responsive dialog sizing for alert dialogs, using half screen width on large/xlarge devices. Apply consistent layout parameters to various alert dialogs for improved presentation.

Further adjusts:
- `astrid_reminder_view.xml`: Added layout weight in landscape for better space distribution.
- `astrid_speech_bubble.xml`: Removed `alignParentBottom` from an ImageView.
- Updated speech bubble reminder drawables.
