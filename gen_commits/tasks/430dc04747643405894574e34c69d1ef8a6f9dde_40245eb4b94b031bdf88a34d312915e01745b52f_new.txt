refactor: Centralize and abstract Markdown handling

Introduces a dedicated `org.tasks.markdown` package with interfaces and
implementations to abstract the Markwon library usage.

This change:
- Decouples UI components from direct Markwon library specifics.
- Provides a `MarkdownProvider` for consistent configuration and injection.
- Simplifies markdown rendering logic across various UI elements
  (task edit, changelog, notifications, task list, widgets).
- Enhances maintainability and flexibility for markdown features.
