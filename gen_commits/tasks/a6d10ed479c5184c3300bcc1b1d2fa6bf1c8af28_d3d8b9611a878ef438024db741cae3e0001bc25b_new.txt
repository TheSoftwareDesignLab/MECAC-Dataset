feat: Allow creating new tasks with a pre-selected filter

The `TaskIntents.getNewTaskIntent` method now accepts an optional `Filter`. This enables new tasks to be created with a specific filter applied.
The TasksWidget was updated to leverage this, ensuring new tasks created from a widget automatically inherit its configured filter.
The TileService was adjusted to pass `null` to maintain its original behavior.
