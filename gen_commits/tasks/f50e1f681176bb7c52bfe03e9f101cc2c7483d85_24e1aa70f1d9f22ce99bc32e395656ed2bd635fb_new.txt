refactor: Abstract PowerWidget and consolidate database update listeners

This commit significantly refactors the PowerWidget architecture and streamlines how components respond to database updates.

Key changes include:
- Introduced an abstract `PowerWidget` base class and `PowerWidget.UpdateService` to define common widget behavior.
- Created concrete `PowerWidget44` and `PowerWidget42` implementations to separate 4x4 and 4x2 widget logic.
- Implemented a `DatabaseUpdateListener` interface, replacing direct update calls in `TaskDao`.
- Consolidated all database change notifications (for widgets, content providers, etc.) into a single array of `DatabaseUpdateListener`s within `TaskDao`, improving extensibility and clarity.
- Renamed widget-related receivers and services in `AndroidManifest.xml` to reflect the new `PowerWidget44` and `PowerWidget42` structure.
