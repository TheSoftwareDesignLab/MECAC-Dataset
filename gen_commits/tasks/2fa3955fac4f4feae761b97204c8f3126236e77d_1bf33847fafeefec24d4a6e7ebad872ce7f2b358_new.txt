Moved all TaskListActivity intent generation into TaskIntents.java.
Simplified TaskListActivity navigation by always launching a new activity for filters.
Updated widget intent handling to use the new centralized methods.
Made widget task rows entirely clickable by applying fill-in intent to the body.
Removed unused `isSinglePaneLayout()` helper.
