fix: Correct plugin condition logic for update messages

Reverses the conditional checks for `plugin` and `notPlugin` in update message processing.
Previously, messages with a `plugin` condition were incorrectly shown when the plugin *did not* match, and `notPlugin` messages were shown when the plugin *did* match.

This change ensures update messages are displayed as intended:
- `plugin`: Message is shown only if the specified plugin condition matches.
- `notPlugin`: Message is shown only if the specified plugin condition does not match.
