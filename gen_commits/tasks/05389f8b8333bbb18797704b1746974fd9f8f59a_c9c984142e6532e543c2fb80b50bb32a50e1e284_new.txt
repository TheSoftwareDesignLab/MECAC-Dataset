refactor: Streamline task edit state management and remove event bus

Removed the MainActivityEventBus and MainActivityEvent system for
simpler communication. TaskEditFragment now directly updates the
MainActivityViewModel to clear the current task after save, discard,
or delete. Also removed unused ExperimentalSharedTransitionApi.
