fix: Improve shortcut reliability and configuration persistence

Switch from manual icon Bitmap extraction to `Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_ICON_RESOURCE` for launcher shortcuts. This simplifies the code, improves compatibility, and uses the recommended API for static icons.
Explicitly set the `ComponentName` when creating task list intents for shortcuts to enhance reliability.
Persist selected filter and theme in `ShortcutConfigActivity` across configuration changes to prevent data loss.
