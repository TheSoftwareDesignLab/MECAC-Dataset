feat: Display widget color and icon in preferences

Enhance the appearance of widget list items in the Widgets preference screen.
Each widget entry now shows its configured color using an `IconPreference`.
Additionally, a right arrow icon is displayed to indicate navigation.

Refactor `tintColorPreference` in `InjectingPreferenceFragment` to accept a
`Preference` object directly, improving reusability.
