feat: Use custom dialog for actionable update messages

Replaced standard AlertDialog with a custom-designed dialog (`update_message_view.xml`)
for displaying update messages that include an action (e.g., link to a screen or prefs).
This provides a more integrated and branded user experience.
Introduced MessageTuple to encapsulate message, link text, and click listener.
