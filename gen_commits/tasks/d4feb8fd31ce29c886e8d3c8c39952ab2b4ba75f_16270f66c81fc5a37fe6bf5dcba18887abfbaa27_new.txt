chore(ko): Refine reminder terminology and discard phrasing

Standardize "알림" to "알람" for consistency in reminder-related strings.
Consistently use "폐기" for discarding changes instead of "취소" or "버리다".
Improve phrasing for calendar reminder speech bubbles and timer estimates.
Add translation for `when_started`.
