docs: Improve clarity and consistency of string resource names

Refactor:
- Renamed numerous string resources across multiple XML files for better clarity and consistency, adding specific prefixes like "Backup:", "RTM:", "Reminder Preference:", and "Task Edit:".
- Moved `TEA_reminder_random_hours` string array from `strings-reminders.xml` to `keys.xml` to centralize key-value definitions.
- Updated POT-Creation-Date in translation files.
