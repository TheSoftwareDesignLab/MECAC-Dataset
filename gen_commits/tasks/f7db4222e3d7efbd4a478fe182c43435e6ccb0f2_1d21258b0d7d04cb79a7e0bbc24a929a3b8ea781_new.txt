feat: Improve task creation and widget synchronization

Prevent saving tasks with empty titles; new blank tasks are now discarded.
The app widget now updates automatically when the TaskListActivity stops, reflecting recent changes.
Fixed widget's task query by explicitly adding the 'ORDER BY' keyword.
Removed `//$NON-NLS-1$` comments and updated launch mode to 'debug'.
