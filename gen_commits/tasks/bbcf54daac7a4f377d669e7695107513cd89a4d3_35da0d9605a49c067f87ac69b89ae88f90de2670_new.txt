feat: Add one-time swipe between lists helper dialog

Introduces a helper dialog to guide users on how to swipe between task lists.

The helper dialog is shown once when the user first interacts with swipe functionality or selects a filter. It is dismissed after the user has swiped to another list or changed the swipe performance settings. A new preference `PREF_SHOWED_SWIPE_HELPER` tracks whether the helper has been displayed.
