refactor: Convert FilterListItem to Kotlin interface

Refactor the filter hierarchy by changing `FilterListItem` from an abstract Java class to a Kotlin interface.
Common properties such as `id`, `icon`, `listingTitle`, `tint`, `count`, and `order` were moved from `FilterListItem` to the `Filter` class.
The `principals` property was moved to `CaldavFilter` for better type specificity.
`NavigationDrawerAction`, `NavigationDrawerSeparator`, and `NavigationDrawerSubheader` were converted to Kotlin `@Parcelize` data classes implementing the new `FilterListItem` interface.
This change simplifies the filter object hierarchy and aligns it with modern Kotlin best practices.
