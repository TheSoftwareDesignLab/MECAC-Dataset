feat(i18n): Add Croatian strings for reminders and custom filters

Added new localization strings for reminder functionality, snooze, and custom notifications.
This includes:
- `custom_filter_has_reminder`
- `snoozed_until`
- `custom_notification`
- Plural forms for `reminder_hours`, `reminder_days`, `reminder_week`, `reminder_minutes`.
Corrected the plural form for `repeat_weeks` for 'other' quantity.
