refactor(widget): Pass task ID instead of full Task object in intents

Replaces passing the entire Task object as a Parcelable with only its ID
in widget click intents. This reduces intent payload size and ensures
the `WidgetClickActivity` always operates on the freshest task data
by fetching it from the database when required.
The completion state is now explicitly passed for the COMPLETE_TASK action.
