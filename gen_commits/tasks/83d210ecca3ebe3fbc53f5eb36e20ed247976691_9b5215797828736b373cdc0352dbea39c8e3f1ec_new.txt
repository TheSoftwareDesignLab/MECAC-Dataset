fix: Prevent widget frame distortion using 9-patch images

Migrated widget_frame drawables from standard PNGs to 9-patch PNGs across various densities. This resolves issues with the widget frame distorting when scaled on different screen sizes and orientations.
Additionally, refined widget layout parameters such as `layout_height`, `paddingTop`, and title `TextView` height to better accommodate the new scalable frame and improve visual consistency.
