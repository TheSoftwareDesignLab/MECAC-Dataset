feat: Implement swipe to snooze for notifications

When enabled, swiping away a task reminder notification will snooze it for a configurable duration instead of dismissing it permanently.

This provides an alternative to persistent notifications and offers more flexible handling of task reminders directly from the notification shade.

A 0ms snooze interval is internally converted to 1 second to prevent the alarm service from missing the re-snooze request.
