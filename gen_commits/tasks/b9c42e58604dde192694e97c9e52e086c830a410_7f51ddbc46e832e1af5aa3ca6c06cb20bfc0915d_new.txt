refactor: Organize list view preferences into dedicated section

- Introduced a new "List view" preference screen (`p_list_view`) to consolidate related settings.
- Moved preference screens for menu item visibility and filter customization, along with individual preferences for quickadd controls, swipe gestures, list member display, and voice input settings, under the new "List view" section.
- Corrected the preference type check in `Preferences.java` to properly handle `String` values when setting preferences if unset.
- Updated theme retrieval in `ThemeService.java` to use `getUnsimplifiedTheme()` for more reliable dark theme detection.
- Adjusted the title for "Beast mode" preference screen to "Task edit screen".
