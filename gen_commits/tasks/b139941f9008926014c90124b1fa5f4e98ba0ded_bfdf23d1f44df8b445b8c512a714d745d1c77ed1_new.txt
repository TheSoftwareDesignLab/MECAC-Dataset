refactor: Centralize chip creation and simplify API

The `ChipProvider` now manages its `Activity` context internally via dependency injection,
removing the need to pass it as a parameter in many chip creation methods.

- Simplified `ChipProvider` method signatures by removing redundant `Activity` arguments.
- Introduced `newSubtaskChip` to consolidate subtask chip creation logic.
- Migrated `SubtaskViewHolder` to use a `ChipGroup` and the refactored `ChipProvider`
  for displaying subtask counts and collapse/expand functionality.
- Removed `Locale` dependency from `SubtaskViewHolder` and `SubtasksRecyclerAdapter`,
  moving locale-specific formatting into `ChipProvider`.
