feat: Implement triple-pane layout for large landscape screens

Introduces a new layout for large landscape devices that displays the filter list,
task list, and task edit views side-by-side in three panes.

Refactors fragment management logic across activities:
- Replaced boolean `mMultipleFragments` with an integer `fragmentLayout` to
  explicitly handle single, double, and triple-pane states.
- Generalized fragment setup and removal with new helper methods.
- Adjusted layout weights for the existing double-pane layout on large screens.
