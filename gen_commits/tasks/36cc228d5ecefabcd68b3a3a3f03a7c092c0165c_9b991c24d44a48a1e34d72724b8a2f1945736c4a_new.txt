i18n: Add French strings for location and intent handling

Adds French translations for new UI text. This includes:
- Strings to differentiate between background and foreground location usage.
- A detailed message for users regarding required background location permissions for location-based reminders.
- A generic message for when no application is found to handle a particular request (e.g., an implicit intent).
