refactor(ko): Refine and expand Korean UI strings

Standardize sorting terminology from '[criterion]순' to '[criterion] 기준'.
Update '위치' (location) to '장소' (place) for improved clarity.
Adjust phrasing for repeat intervals, removing redundant '회'.
Introduce new strings for sorting options, including '정렬', '분류', '오름차순', '내림차순', and '완료일시 기준'.
