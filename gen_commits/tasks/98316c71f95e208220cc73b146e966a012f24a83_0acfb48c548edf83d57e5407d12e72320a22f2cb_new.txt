refactor: Separate unsimplified theme retrieval

Introduces `getUnsimplifiedTheme()` to retrieve the base theme without applying simplification for settings like "simple input boxes".
Methods for widgets, theme colors, and dialogs now explicitly call this new method, ensuring they use the core theme preference. The original `getTheme()` is now private and retains the simplification logic for the main app theme.
