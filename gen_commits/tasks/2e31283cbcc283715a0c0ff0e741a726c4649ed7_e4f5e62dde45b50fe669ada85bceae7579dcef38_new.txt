feat: Implement RefreshScheduler and refine task visibility

Introduces a new RefreshScheduler to ensure task lists and filters are updated promptly when tasks become visible (based on HIDE_UNTIL) or their due dates pass.

The scheduler uses AlarmManager to trigger broadcasts that refresh the task and filter lists. It's integrated into the ReminderSchedulingService and TaskService for comprehensive scheduling.

Also updates the TaskApiDao.TaskCriteria.isVisible() method to correctly use 'less than or equal to' for HIDE_UNTIL, ensuring tasks become visible at the exact scheduled time.
