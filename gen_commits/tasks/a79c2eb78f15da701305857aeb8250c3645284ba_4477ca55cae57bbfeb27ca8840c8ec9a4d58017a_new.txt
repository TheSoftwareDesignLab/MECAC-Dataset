feat: Delay automatic sync on single pane layouts

Refactor `initiateAutomaticSync` to introduce a 2-second delay before
initiating a sync when in single-fragment (e.g., phone) layouts. This
prevents immediate background syncs upon rapid list switching, improving
overall responsiveness and user experience. Subclasses should now
override `initiateAutomaticSyncImpl`.
