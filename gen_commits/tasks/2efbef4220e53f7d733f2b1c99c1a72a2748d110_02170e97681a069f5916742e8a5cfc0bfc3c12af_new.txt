refactor: Adjust layout and spacing of "Waiting on Me" banner

The "Waiting on Me" banner in the task edit activity has been refactored for better visual presentation and improved touch targets.
- Added padding to the overall banner container.
- Removed redundant left margin from the message text.
- Ensured "Dismiss" and "Acknowledge" buttons fill the parent height.
- Added right margin to the "Dismiss" button for proper spacing.
