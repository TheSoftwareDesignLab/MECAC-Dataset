feat: Allow completing and editing tasks from widget

This change introduces interactive elements to the tasks widget, enabling users to complete or edit tasks directly from the widget list.

- Updated `widget_row.xml` to include a checkbox.
- `TasksWidget` now handles `COMPLETE_TASK` and `EDIT_TASK` broadcast intents:
  - Toggles task completion for `COMPLETE_TASK`.
  - Opens `TaskEditActivity` (or `TaskListActivity` for tablet) for `EDIT_TASK`.
- `ScrollableViewsFactory` sets fill-in intents for the checkbox and task title, and displays the appropriate checkbox icon based on task status, importance, and recurrence.
- Made relevant drawable arrays in `TaskAdapter` public for widget rendering.
- Registered new widget actions in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
