fix: Properly initialize TaskListFragmentPager on filter mode change

Extracted the setup logic for the TaskListFragmentPager into a dedicated `setupPagerAdapter` method.

This ensures the pager is correctly initialized or re-initialized when switching between filter modes, preventing potential issues with an outdated pager state. It also guarantees the correct list title is displayed in the header immediately after a mode change when swipe functionality is enabled.
