Refined notification logic: quiet hours and "hide until" conditions now apply only to periodic reminders.
Updated UI colors for overdue tasks and importance levels.
Increased task list item text size for improved readability.
Migrated hardcoded preference strings to dedicated string resources.
Bumped app version to 1.9.8 (versionCode 34).
