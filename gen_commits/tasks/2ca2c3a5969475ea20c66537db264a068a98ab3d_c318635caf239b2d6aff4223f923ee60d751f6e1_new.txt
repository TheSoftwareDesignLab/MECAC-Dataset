feat: Add change list button to scrollable widget header

Adds a new button to the scrollable widget header, allowing users to select a
different filter/list for the widget directly.

- Tapping the button opens `FilterSelectionActivity`, which now saves the
  selected filter to the specific widget's preferences.
- Widget update logic is centralized into a `reconfigureWidget` method.
- `FilterSelectionActivity` is given `android:taskAffinity=""`.
- Includes minor UI adjustments like padding, header height, and content
  descriptions.
