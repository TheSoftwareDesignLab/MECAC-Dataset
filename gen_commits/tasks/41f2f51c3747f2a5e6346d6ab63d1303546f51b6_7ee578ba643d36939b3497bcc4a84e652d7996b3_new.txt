refactor: Migrate date/time pickers to use explicit states

Extract `DueDatePicker` composable from `DateTimePicker` fragment.
Update `TimePickerDialog` and `DatePickerBottomSheet` to accept explicit `TimePickerState` and `SheetState` parameters.
Introduce `@Preview` for `DueDatePicker` to facilitate better UI development.
Improve UI for date/time shortcut buttons by limiting column width and adding text ellipsis for overflow.
