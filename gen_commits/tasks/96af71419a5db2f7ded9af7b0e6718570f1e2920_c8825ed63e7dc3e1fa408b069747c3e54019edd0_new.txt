feat(i18n): Add new French strings for subscriptions and UI

Adds new French translations for subscription-related messages (status, pricing, expiration).
Includes new strings for user login status, Tasks.org sync description, and a general 'More options' label.
Updates the 'manage subscription' text from 'Gérer' to 'Modifier' for improved clarity.
