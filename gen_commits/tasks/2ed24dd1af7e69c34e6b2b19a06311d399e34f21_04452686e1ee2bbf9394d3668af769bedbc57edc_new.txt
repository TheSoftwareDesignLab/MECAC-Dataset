feat: Add option to display due dates in widgets

Introduces a new "Show due date" checkbox in the widget configuration, allowing users to display task due dates directly in widget rows.

This change extracts due date formatting into a dedicated `DueDateFormatter` class and updates widget rendering to display the formatted dates.

Also, fixes a bug where completed tasks could still be marked as overdue in the `isOverdue()` logic, ensuring they are correctly considered non-overdue.
