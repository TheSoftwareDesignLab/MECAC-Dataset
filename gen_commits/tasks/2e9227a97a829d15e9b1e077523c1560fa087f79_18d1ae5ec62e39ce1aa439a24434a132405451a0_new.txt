refactor: Unify theming with AppCompat DayNight mode

Migrate to Theme.AppCompat.DayNight.NoActionBar for dynamic theme management.
Introduce AppCompatDelegate for automatic day/night mode switching.
Refactor ThemeBase and related classes to simplify color retrieval and integrate with the new theming system.
Consolidate theme definitions and remove deprecated theme attributes, using direct R.color references where appropriate.
Update widget theming to align with the new structure.
