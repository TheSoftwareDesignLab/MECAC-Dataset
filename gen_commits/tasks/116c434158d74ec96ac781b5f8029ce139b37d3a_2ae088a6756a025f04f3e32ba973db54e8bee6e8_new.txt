feat(i18n): Add new Kannada (kn) string resources

This commit introduces several new localized strings for the Kannada language (`values-kn/strings.xml`).
These strings include translations for UI elements such as date button, undo dialog, time input, task deletion confirmation, discard confirmation, and read permission label.
