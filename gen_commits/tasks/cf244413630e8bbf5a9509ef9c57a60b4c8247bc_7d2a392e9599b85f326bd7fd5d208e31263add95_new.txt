refactor(welcome): Externalize strings and simplify layout

Moved welcome screen titles and body texts from hardcoded strings to dedicated string resources in `strings-welcome.xml`.
Updated `ViewPagerAdapter` to use these new string resources, enabling easier internationalization.
Simplified `welcome_walkthrough_page.xml` by removing a redundant RelativeLayout wrapper and setting the background directly on the root LinearLayout.
Removed `welcome_show_eula` from `strings-core.xml` as it's now in `strings-welcome.xml`.
Added `scaleType="fitCenter"` to the welcome image.
