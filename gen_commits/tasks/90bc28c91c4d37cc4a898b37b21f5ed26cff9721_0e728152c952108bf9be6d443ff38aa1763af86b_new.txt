refactor: Consolidate location and geofencing into LocationService

Merge LocationProvider and Geofencing into a single unified LocationService interface.
This refactoring combines AndroidLocationProvider, PlayLocationProvider,
AndroidGeofencing, and GoogleGeofencing into platform-specific implementations:
LocationServiceAndroid and LocationServiceGooglePlay.
The LocationManager interface was extended to directly support proximity alerts.
This simplifies dependency injection and provides a consistent API for location features.
