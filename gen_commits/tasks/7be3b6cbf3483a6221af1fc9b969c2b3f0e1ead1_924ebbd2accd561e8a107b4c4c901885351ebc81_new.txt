feat: Add selectable option to FilterAdapter

Allows FilterAdapter to manage filter selections. When the 'selectable' flag is true, the first filter offered will be automatically selected if no selection is present. This feature is utilized by WidgetConfigActivity to enable users to choose a filter for their widget.
