refactor(widget): Rework configuration dialog and layout

- Migrate widget and shortcut configuration from activities to a dialog-based flow.
- Replace `InjectingListActivity` with `InjectingAppCompatActivity` for `ShortcutConfigActivity` and introduce `WidgetConfigDialog`.
- Enhance widget customization by adding an opacity slider and dynamically styling backgrounds, deprecating separate dark/light widget layouts.
- Improve DashClock extension robustness by adding error handling around `publishUpdate` calls.
