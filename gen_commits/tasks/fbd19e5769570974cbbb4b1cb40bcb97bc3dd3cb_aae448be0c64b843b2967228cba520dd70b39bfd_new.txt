feat: Redesign shortcut creation with custom name and icon

Introduces a dedicated configuration screen for creating home screen shortcuts.
Users can now select the target task list, set a custom name, and choose a color theme for the shortcut icon.
This replaces the immediate filter selection dialog with a full-screen activity, enhancing user experience and customization options.
The activity theme has also been updated.
