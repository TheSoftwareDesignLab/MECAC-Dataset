fix: Ensure scrollable widget data refreshes on update

The RemoteAdapter intent now includes a unique data URI using System.currentTimeMillis(). This forces the associated RemoteViewsFactory to recreate, preventing issues where the widget's list view might display stale data due to caching.

Additionally, the onUpdate method was refactored to directly process the provided appWidgetIds and improve error handling granularity for each widget.
