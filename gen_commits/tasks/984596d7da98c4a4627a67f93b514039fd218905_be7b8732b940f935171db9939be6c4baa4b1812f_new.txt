feat: Enhance RTL support and simplify dialog item lists

Refactor dialog builder to accept `List<String>` directly for items and single choice items.
Implement locale-aware text directionality marks (LRM/RLM) for dialog list items to ensure correct rendering in RTL languages (on Jellybean MR1+).
Apply locale-specific layout direction to dialog buttons and adjust `textAlignment` for various UI elements to `viewStart` for improved RTL compatibility.
Rename and adjust `LocaleUtils` methods for better clarity and consistency.
