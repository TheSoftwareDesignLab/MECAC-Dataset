refactor: Streamline widget update scheduling and service lifecycle

Removed obsolete widget update interval constant and helper method.
Widget updates are now scheduled directly within `createScrollableWidget`
using `AlarmManager` with a 30-minute interval, targeting
`ScrollableWidgetUpdateService`. This also removes pre-ICS specific
scheduling logic. `ScrollableWidgetUpdateService` now stops itself
immediately after `onStart` to ensure single-shot execution.
Additionally, `WidgetUpdateService` helper methods were made private
for improved encapsulation.
