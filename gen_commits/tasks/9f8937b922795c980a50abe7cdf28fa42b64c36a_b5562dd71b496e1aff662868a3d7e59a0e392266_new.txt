fix: Refresh comments list on UI thread

Ensures that UI updates for the comments list (refreshUpdatesList()) are performed on the main UI thread.
This prevents potential crashes or IllegalStateExceptions if the operation is triggered from a background thread.
A null check for the activity is also added to prevent NullPointerExceptions if the fragment is detached.
