feat: Enhance dialogs and refactor ThemeService color handling

Refactor `ThemeService.getDialogTextColor` to return an integer color resource.
Introduces `getDialogTextColorString` for retrieving HTML color strings.

This commit also:
- Improves the update message dialogs with proper text color, size, link
  movement, and dismiss-on-click functionality.
- Applies the dialog theme to the `UpdateScreenFlow` activity.
- Updates various dialogs (changelog, help screens) to use the new color
  retrieval methods consistently.
