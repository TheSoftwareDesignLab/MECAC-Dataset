fix: Enhance Gtasks authentication robustness and user experience

Replaces the temporary authentication toast with a persistent progress dialog.
Introduces a 60-second timeout for fetching the auth token and displays an error
message on failure. Retries authentication if the user grants permissions after
an initial prompt. Also sets RESULT_OK upon successful sync.
