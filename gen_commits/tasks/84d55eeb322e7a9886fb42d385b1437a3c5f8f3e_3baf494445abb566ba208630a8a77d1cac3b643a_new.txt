feat: Add dedicated theming for quick add bar background

Introduces 'asQuickaddBackgroundColor' to allow themes to customize the quick add bar's background independently from the action bar.

Also, hides the TagUpdatesFragment when a task is clicked and shows it again on back press to improve UI flow during task editing.
