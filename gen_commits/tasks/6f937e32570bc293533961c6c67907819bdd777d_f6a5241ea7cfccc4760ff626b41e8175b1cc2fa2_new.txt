feat(i18n-cs): Add Czech translations for location, subtasks, and sync

- Introduces new string resources for:
  - Location-based features (map provider, permissions, choosing locations)
  - Subtask management (expand/collapse, multi-level support, display options)
  - Synchronization services (Google Tasks, CalDAV, EteSync descriptions, settings)
  - Other UI elements like payment options, licenses, changelog, and general settings.
- Corrects the translation for "tags" from "Tagy" to "Štítky".
