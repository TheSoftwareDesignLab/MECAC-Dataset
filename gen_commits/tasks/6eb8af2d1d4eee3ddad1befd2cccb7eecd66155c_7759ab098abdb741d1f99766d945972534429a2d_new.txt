refactor: Adjust widget padding and update ActFm dev API config

Reduced left padding for widgets across various layouts (land, xlarge-land, default)
from 40dp to 5dp. Also removed explicit right padding from landscape layouts.

Updated the ActFm API URL and credentials to point to a local development
environment, facilitating local testing and integration.
