feat: Allow pinning task list widget from settings

Introduces the ability to pin a task list widget directly from the list settings screen to the home screen.

This feature leverages Android 8.0 (Oreo) and higher's `requestPinAppWidget` functionality. When pinning, the widget is automatically configured with the current list's filter and color. A new `RequestPinWidgetReceiver` handles the configuration callback.
