refactor: Migrate to MdcTheme for Compose theming

Replaced the custom TasksTheme implementation with the official
`compose-theme-adapter` library. This simplifies the theming logic
and ensures better integration with Material Design Components in
Jetpack Compose. Removed the now redundant custom theme composable.
