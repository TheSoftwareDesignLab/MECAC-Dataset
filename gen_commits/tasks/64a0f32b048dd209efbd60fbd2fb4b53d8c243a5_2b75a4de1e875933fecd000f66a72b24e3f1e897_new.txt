feat: Add landscape layout for people list and adjust 3-pane height

Added `people_list_fragment.xml` for landscape orientation to provide an optimized view.
Adjusted `people_list_fragment_3pane.xml` `layout_height` to `fill_parent` to ensure it takes up available vertical space.
Updated the quick add hint for assigning tasks to be more concise.
