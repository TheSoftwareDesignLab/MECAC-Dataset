feat: Display context-aware sync upgrade prompts

Initial implementation to show different sync upgrade dialogs based on the user's
login status for Astrid.com and Google Tasks. New string resources are added for
the prompt titles and bodies.

Note: Dialog buttons and their respective listeners are still marked as TODO.
