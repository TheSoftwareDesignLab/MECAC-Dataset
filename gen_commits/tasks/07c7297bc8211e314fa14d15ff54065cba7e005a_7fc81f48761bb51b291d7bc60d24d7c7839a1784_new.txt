feat(ja): Add sort option strings and refine translations

Introduces new strings for sorting functionality, including "sort_not_available", "sort_sorting", "sort_grouping", "sort_ascending", "sort_descending", and "sort_completed".
Also refines several existing Japanese phrases for conciseness and improved clarity, such as simplifying "このタスクを削除しますか？" to "タスクを削除しますか？" and adjusting timer comments. Ensures consistent use of Japanese question marks (？).
