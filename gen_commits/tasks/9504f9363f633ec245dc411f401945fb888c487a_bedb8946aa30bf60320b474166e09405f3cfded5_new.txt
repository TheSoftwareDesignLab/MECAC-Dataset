refactor(i18n): Improve Chinese backup terminology

Updates several Chinese (zh-rCN) strings for better clarity and consistency
in backup-related UI elements. This includes renaming import/export actions
and simplifying the Google Drive backup option. A new string for
"Automatic backups" has also been added.
