feat: Enhance theme options and dialog styling

Refactor theme application for several activities, moving some `android:theme`
declarations from AndroidManifest.xml to programmatic application or relying
on parent themes.

Introduce a new `Theme.Dialog` style to provide consistent styling for
dialog-based activities. Update `Theme.Transparent` and `Theme.TransparentWhite`
to properly support translucent window animations and properties.

Adjust animation durations for slide transitions and make minor UI tweaks
to note link colors, loading text size, and task row padding.
