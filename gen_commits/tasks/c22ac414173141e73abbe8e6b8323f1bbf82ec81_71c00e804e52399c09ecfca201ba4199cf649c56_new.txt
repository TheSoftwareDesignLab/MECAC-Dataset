fix: Prevent dialog state loss and refine UI components

- Ensure `CalendarSelectionDialog` preserves its `enableNone` state across configuration changes.
- Introduce a static factory method for `CalendarSelectionDialog` for clearer instantiation and apply the correct theme.
- Prevent `FileExplore` from re-launching or re-initializing on configuration changes and add robustness to permission handling.
- Standardize setting empty titles to `""` instead of `null` for various dialogs and activities.
- Adjust `simple_list_item_single_choice_themed` height for improved UI density.
- Generalize free theme logic in `ColorPickerDialog`.
- Clean up redundant `colorAccentDialog` definitions in `theme.xml`.
