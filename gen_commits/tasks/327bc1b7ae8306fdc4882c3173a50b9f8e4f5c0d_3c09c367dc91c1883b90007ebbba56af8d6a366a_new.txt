fix: Show loading indicator immediately when filling data

Moves the visibility setting for the loading text to the beginning of the `fillData()` method. This ensures that the loading indicator is displayed as soon as the task list starts populating, providing immediate visual feedback to the user. Previously, the indicator's visibility was set later, potentially delaying its appearance or making it inconsistent.
