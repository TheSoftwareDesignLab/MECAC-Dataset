fix: Refresh TaskListActivity when switching to assigned filter

The `switchToAssignedFilter` method now launches a new `TaskListActivity` instance instead of updating the current one. This ensures a complete refresh of the activity state when applying the "Assigned by Me" filter, resolving potential inconsistencies from in-place updates. A short delay and transition are included for a smoother user experience.
