feat: Improve quick add controls display and defaults

Refined the visibility logic for the quick add bar controls.
Controls will now only appear when the quick add input field has text and focus,
preventing unnecessary clutter when the field is empty.

Additionally, the 'show quick add controls' preference (p_show_quickadd_controls)
is now enabled by default for Astrid Lite installations.
