refactor: Update UI text styles to MaterialComponents typography

This change standardizes text styling across several UI components by
migrating from generic `android:textAppearance` or `TextAppearance.AppCompat`
to `TextAppearance.MaterialComponents` variants. It also ensures consistent
text coloring by explicitly setting `android:textColor="@color/text_primary"`
where appropriate and updating the base `TextAppearance` style.
