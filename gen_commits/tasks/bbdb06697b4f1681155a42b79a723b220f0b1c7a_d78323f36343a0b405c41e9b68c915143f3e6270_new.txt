feat: Enhance TaskEdit controls for improved theme compatibility

Refactor ThemeService to use a unified `getTheme()` method.
Introduce theme-aware drawable and color retrieval for TaskEdit elements.
Apply dynamic styling to icons and text in various TaskEdit control sets,
including assignee, calendar, tags, timer, deadline, notes, and hide until.
Remove unused `task_edit_selected` color and minor cleanup of `TaskEditFragment` dependencies.
