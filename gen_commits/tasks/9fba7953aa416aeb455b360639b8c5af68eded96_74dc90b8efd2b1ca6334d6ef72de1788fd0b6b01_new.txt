feat: Add Task.isOverdue() for centralized overdue logic

Introduces a new `isOverdue()` method to the `Task` model. This method encapsulates the logic for determining if a task is past its due date, considering whether a specific due time is set.

Refactors `TaskAdapter` and `TasksWidget` to utilize this new method, removing duplicated overdue calculation logic and improving code maintainability and consistency.
