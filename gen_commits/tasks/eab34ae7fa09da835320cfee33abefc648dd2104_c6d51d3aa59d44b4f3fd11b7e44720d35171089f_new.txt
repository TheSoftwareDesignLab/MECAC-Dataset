feat: Dynamically set draggable list item height

Removes hardcoded item height from XML and introduces dynamic calculation.
The DraggableListView now supports programmatic setting of its normal item
height. TaskAdapter introduces a new `computeFullRowHeight` method, which is
then used by AstridOrderedListFragmentHelper to configure the DraggableListView
for subtasks. This improves layout flexibility.
