feat: Migrate quiet hours & font size preferences to ListPreference

Switched 'Quiet Hours Start/End' and 'Task List Font Size' preferences from
EditTextPreference to ListPreference. This provides a better user experience
with predefined options, preventing invalid input.

This change also includes:
* Added corresponding string arrays for these new ListPreference options in
  both English and Spanish.
* Updated several English and Spanish string descriptions for clarity,
  including for quiet hours, default reminders, and font size.
* Corrected the tag count logic in TagListSubActivity.
* Included updated Spanish translations and a new translator credit.
