refactor: Centralize widget preferences and config activities

Moved widget preference keys to the abstract `WidgetConfigActivity`.
Refactored specific widget configuration activities into nested `ConfigActivity` classes within their respective widget providers (`TasksWidget`, `PowerWidget42`, `PowerWidget44`).
Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` and widget provider XMLs to reflect the new class paths.
