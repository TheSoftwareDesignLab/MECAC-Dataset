style: Adjust assigned control layout and adopt theme attributes

- Applied `layout_marginBottom` to the container LinearLayout.
- Added `layout_marginLeft` and `paddingLeft` to the `ContactsAutoComplete` field for better spacing.
- Replaced hardcoded text color with `?attr/asTextColor`.
- Set background to `?attr/asEditTextBackground` for theme consistency.
