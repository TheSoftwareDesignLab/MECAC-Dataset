feat(ui): Adopt Material Design for dialogs and buttons

Migrate `AlertDialogBuilder` to `MaterialAlertDialogBuilder` and convert purchase
price selection cells to checkable `MaterialButton`s.

Introduce custom Material button styles with accent-themed state colors and
streamline `PurchaseHolder` by removing direct `Context` dependency for styling.
This ensures a more consistent Material Design look across the application.
