fix: Synchronize drag and drop state updates

Removes `scope.launch` for immediate task indentation updates during
drag and drop. The `moved` function now uses `runBlocking` when calling
`adapter.moved` to ensure sequential processing of state changes,
addressing potential concurrency issues with drag and drop interactions.
