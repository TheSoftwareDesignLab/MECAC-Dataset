refactor: Enhance widget layout and remove list dividers

Removed default dividers from the scrollable widget's list view.
Refactored `widget_row.xml` to improve alignment and structure:
- Vertically centered the completion checkbox and consolidated its padding.
- Wrapped task text and due date in a vertical `LinearLayout` for consistent stacking and alignment.
