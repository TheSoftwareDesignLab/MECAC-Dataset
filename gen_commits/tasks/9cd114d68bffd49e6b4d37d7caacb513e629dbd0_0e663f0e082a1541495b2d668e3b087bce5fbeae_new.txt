feat(de): Add clear completed tasks string; refine priority terminology

Added `clear_completed_tasks_count` string for displaying the count of tasks to be deleted.
Updated German localization to consistently use "Priorität" instead of "Wichtigkeit" for task sorting, labels, controls, default settings, and filter criteria, improving clarity and consistency.
