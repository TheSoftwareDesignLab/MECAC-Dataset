feat: Implement automatic background synchronization

This commit introduces a major overhaul of the synchronization system to support automatic background synchronization and improve overall robustness.

Key changes include:
- A new `SynchronizationService` that runs in the background, scheduling periodic synchronizations based on user preferences.
- Refactored synchronization logic into an abstract `SynchronizationProvider` class, allowing different sync services (e.g., RTM) to share common mechanisms. This also separates UI-related progress updates from background service execution.
- Updated sync preferences UI to use a `ListPreference` for auto-sync intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) and display last sync/auto-sync attempt dates.
- Enhanced sync results dialog with detailed statistics on created, updated, merged, and deleted tasks.
- Migrated old free-form sync frequency preference to the new interval-based system on app upgrade.
- `TagController` methods are refactored to remove direct `Activity` dependencies, improving modularity and allowing use within services.
