feat: Apply theme color to navigation bar on Android 8.1+

Introduces `atLeastOreoMR1()` utility method.
Refactors `applyToStatusBar` to `applyToSystemBars` to generalize system bar
color application. The navigation bar now receives the primary theme color
and light/dark flags for appropriate icon visibility on Android 8.1 (Oreo MR1)
and higher.
