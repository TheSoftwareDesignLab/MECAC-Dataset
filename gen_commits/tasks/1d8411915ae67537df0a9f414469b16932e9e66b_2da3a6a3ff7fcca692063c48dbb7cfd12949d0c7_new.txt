refactor: Subtasks: Extract Gtasks ordering and generalize support

Moved Gtasks-specific manual ordering logic from GtasksTaskListUpdater into a new static method GtasksFilter.toManualOrder.

Renamed Filter.isTagFilter() to Filter.supportsSubtasks() to provide a more generic way for filters to indicate support for manual ordering/subtasks.

Updated SubtasksHelper to use the new supportsSubtasks() method and apply type-specific ordering logic (GtasksFilter vs. other manual order filters), simplifying the method's signature and internal conditionals.
