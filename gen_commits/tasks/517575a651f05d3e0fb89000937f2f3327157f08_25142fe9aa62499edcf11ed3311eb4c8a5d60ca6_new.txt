feat: Allow rescheduling tasks directly from widget

Refactor DateTimePicker to directly save task due dates when a task ID is provided, eliminating the need for calling fragments/activities to handle results for due date changes.

Introduces a new preference for controlling the action when a due date is clicked in the widget, enabling direct task rescheduling. Adds ripple effects to interactive widget elements like the complete checkbox and due date.
