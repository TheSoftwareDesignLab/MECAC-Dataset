perf: Improve TaskEditActivity load time with async UI setup

Defers the initialization of most TaskEditControlSet components and add-ons by moving them into a background thread. After a short delay (500ms), these components are added to the UI on the main thread using runOnUiThread. This approach aims to prevent blocking the main thread during TaskEditActivity startup, thereby improving perceived responsiveness and reducing the likelihood of ANRs.
