feat: Introduce static basic task creation utility

The `ShareLinkActivity` now uses a new static method, `QuickAddBar.basicQuickAddTask`, to create tasks from shared links. This decouples the activity from the `TaskListFragment` and its `QuickAddBar` instance. The Google Calendar integration logic for new tasks has been extracted into a private static helper method, `addToCalendar`, for reuse.
