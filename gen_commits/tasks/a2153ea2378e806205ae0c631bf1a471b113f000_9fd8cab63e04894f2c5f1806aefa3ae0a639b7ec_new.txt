feat: Streamline tablet task editing and quick add flow

Remove the deprecated 3-pane tablet layout, making TaskEditActivity consistently use a single-pane view. Automatically open newly created tasks for editing after using the quick add bar. Enhance widget integration to propagate custom filter extras and ensure proper tablet navigation for new task creation.
