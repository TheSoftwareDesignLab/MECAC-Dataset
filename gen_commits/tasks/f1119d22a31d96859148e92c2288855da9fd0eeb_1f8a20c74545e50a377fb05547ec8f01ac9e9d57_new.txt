feat: Allow displaying task tags in scrollable widget

Adds a new preference option to show task tags as chips in the
scrollable widget.

- Implemented `getTagChips` in `ChipProvider` to generate tag RemoteViews.
- Integrated tag display logic into `ScrollableViewsFactory`.
- Added `p_widget_show_tags` preference for user control.
- Refactored widget row chip container from GridLayout to LinearLayout for better chip display.
