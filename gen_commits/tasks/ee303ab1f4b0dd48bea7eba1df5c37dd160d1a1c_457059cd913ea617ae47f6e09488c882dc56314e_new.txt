refactor(widgets): Remove Power Pack widget; fix custom filter values

Removed all components related to the legacy Power Pack widget, including activities,
receivers, and update service calls, streamlining the application.

Addressed an issue in custom filters where null criterion values were skipped,
ensuring they are now correctly treated as empty strings. Also, ensured the
custom filter adapter correctly updates the activity's list before invalidating
the dataset to reflect changes accurately.

Other improvements include:
- Renamed `TaskAdapter.DetailManager` to `ExtendedDetailManager` for clarity.
- Optimized `TaskAdapter.DecorationManager` to avoid unnecessary broadcasts for tasks
  without active timers, improving performance.
- Added null checks in `DecorationManager` for improved robustness.
