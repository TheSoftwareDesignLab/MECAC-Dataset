fix: Correct logic for prioritizing auto-sync date display

Previously, the auto-sync date was only considered if its time difference from the general last sync date was less than one hour. This could prevent a genuinely more recent auto-sync date from being displayed if the time difference was larger.

The updated logic now correctly prioritizes the auto-sync date if it simply occurred after the general last sync date, ensuring the most recent attempt is shown.
