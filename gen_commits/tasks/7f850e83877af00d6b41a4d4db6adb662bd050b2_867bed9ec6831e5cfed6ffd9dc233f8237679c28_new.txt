fix: Improve refresh scheduling for task completion

Schedule a refresh one minute after a task's completion date to ensure prompt UI updates and background processing related to task state changes.
Prevent refresh events from being scheduled in the past, which could lead to unnecessary operations or incorrect behavior.
Removes unused Log and DateTime imports.
