refactor: Use launchIn for flow collection

Refactors flow collection in `initializeDiffer` to use `launchIn`. This provides a more idiomatic and lifecycle-aware way to collect the flow, ensuring `applyDiff` is called on the main thread via `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)` and that the flow's collection is tied to the provided `scope`'s lifecycle.
