feat: Implement drag & drop sorting for subtasks

- Introduced "Drag & Drop with Subtasks" as a new sorting option.
- When enabled for the inbox, the task list switches to a subtask-aware fragment.
- Subtask queries are adjusted to include all tasks for proper manual reordering.
- Refactored `isFilter` to `isInbox` in `TaskListFragment`.
- Updated sort selection dialog layout and relevant strings.
- Corrected padding logic in `DraggableListView` for better drag visual.
