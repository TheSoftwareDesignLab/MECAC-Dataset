refactor: Unify color adaptation logic within ThemeColor

Removed redundant `theme_` color aliases from `colors.xml`. Centralized color adjustment and desaturation logic for different themes (e.g., dark mode) directly within the `ThemeColor` class, using an `adjustColor` flag.

Introduced `Palette.WIDGET` for widget color selection and refactored `ColorPalettePicker` to use the new `adjustColor` parameter.
