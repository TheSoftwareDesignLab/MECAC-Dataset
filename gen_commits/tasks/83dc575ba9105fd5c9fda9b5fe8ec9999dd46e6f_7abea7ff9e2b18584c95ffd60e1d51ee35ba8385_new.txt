refactor(widget): Handle clicks via WidgetClickActivity

Move widget task completion and editing logic from the TasksWidget
broadcast receiver to a dedicated WidgetClickActivity.

This decouples the click handling logic from the AppWidgetProvider
lifecycle and allows for easier management of UI interactions. The new
activity is a translucent dialog that quickly processes the action and
finishes.

Intents now pass full Task and Filter objects instead of just their IDs.
