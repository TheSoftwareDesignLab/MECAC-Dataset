feat(bg): Add new and refine existing strings

Adds translations for new features including app password and backup warnings.
Refines existing translations for clarity and consistency, such as changing
"deadline" to "due date". Replaces Android system string references with
direct Bulgarian translations for "Cancel" and "OK".
