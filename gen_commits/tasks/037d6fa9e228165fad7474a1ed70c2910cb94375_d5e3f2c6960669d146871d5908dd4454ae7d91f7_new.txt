refactor: Consolidate task movement logic into base adapter

Removed GoogleTaskAdapter and CaldavTaskAdapter by moving their task
reparenting and reordering logic into the TaskAdapter base class.

This centralizes drag-and-drop functionality for local, Google, and CalDAV
tasks, simplifying the adapter hierarchy and TaskAdapterProvider.
Updated adapter constructors and drag-and-drop enable conditions accordingly.
