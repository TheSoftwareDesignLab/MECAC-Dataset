refactor: Convert notification popup to ReminderDialog

Extracts reminder popup UI and logic from NotificationFragment into a dedicated ReminderDialog.
Notification text (task title) is now passed via intent for display in the dialog.
Ensures TaskListActivity title is correctly set when navigating from a notification.
The dialog is now displayed on new intent, rather than on activity creation.
