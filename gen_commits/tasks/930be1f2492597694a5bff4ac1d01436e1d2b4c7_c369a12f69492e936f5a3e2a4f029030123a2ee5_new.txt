feat: Relocate and unify 'always display full date' preference

The 'always display full date' preference has been moved from 'Look and Feel'
to 'Date and Time' settings for better organization. This preference is now
consistently applied across the application, including widgets, which now
respect the global setting. Date formatting utilities were updated to use
this preference and support a new 'lowercase' parameter.
