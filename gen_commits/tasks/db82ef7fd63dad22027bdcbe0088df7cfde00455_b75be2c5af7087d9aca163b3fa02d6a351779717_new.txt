refactor: Migrate Compose theme adapter to Accompanist

The deprecated `com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter` has been
replaced with `com.google.accompanist:accompanist-themeadapter-appcompat`.
This involved updating build dependencies and changing `MdcTheme` to
`AppCompatTheme` in all relevant Compose UI components.
