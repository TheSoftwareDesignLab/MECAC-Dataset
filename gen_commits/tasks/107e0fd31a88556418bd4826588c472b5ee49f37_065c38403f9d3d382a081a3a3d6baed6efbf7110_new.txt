refactor: Align white text opacities with Material Design

Adjusts various white color definitions and their usage throughout the app
to match Material Design specifications for text and icon opacities
on dark backgrounds.

Specifically:
- `white_100` (100% opaque) is now `white_87` (87% opaque) for primary elements.
- `white_70` (70% opaque) is now `white_60` (60% opaque) for secondary elements.
- `white_50` (50% opaque) is now `white_38` (38% opaque) for tertiary/disabled elements.
