fix(theming): Ensure comments button text is visible on all themes

The comments button text was hardcoded to white, causing poor visibility on
light themes. This commit updates the text color to use a theme attribute
and adds a specific override for `Theme_White_Alt` to ensure the text is
black. ThemeService methods were made public to allow theme checks.
