feat: Use dedicated layouts for widget light and dark themes

Refactors `ScrollableViewsFactory` to load `widget_row_light.xml` or `widget_row_dark.xml` based on the current theme. This simplifies the Java code by moving theme-specific styling (colors, backgrounds, ripple effects) directly into the XML layouts.

Also improves RTL support for indentation and due date positioning.
