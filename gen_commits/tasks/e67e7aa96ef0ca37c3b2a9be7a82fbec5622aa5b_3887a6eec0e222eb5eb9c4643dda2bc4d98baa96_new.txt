feat: Introduce horizontal time picker layout

Introduces a new horizontal layout (`astrid_time_picker_horizontal.xml`) for the time picker. The existing `astrid_time_picker.xml` is refactored for a vertical orientation.

The system now conditionally selects between these layouts, which also affects the presentation of date shortcuts and UI element sizing.
