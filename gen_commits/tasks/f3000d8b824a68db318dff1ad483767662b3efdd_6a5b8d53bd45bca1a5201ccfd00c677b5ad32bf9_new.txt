feat: Improve widget due date display and grouping

Update `formatDueDate` to use `TaskContainer` for richer context.
Introduce conditional due date display: show only time when tasks are
sorted and grouped by due date, and a task has a specific time.
Otherwise, display relative date/time.
Fix: Pass `Task` object directly when setting rescheduling intent.
Enhance group disabling logic: groups are now also disabled if the
current filter doesn't support sorting or if manual/Astrid sorting is active.
