fix: CalendarView display and navigation improvements

Refactor CalendarView to correctly scale navigation arrows and adjust
vertical layout for different screen densities. Corrected the calculation
for the first day of the month in the grid, aligning it properly based on
the locale's first day of the week. Simplified and improved the robustness
of month-to-month navigation logic to handle day preservation more reliably.
