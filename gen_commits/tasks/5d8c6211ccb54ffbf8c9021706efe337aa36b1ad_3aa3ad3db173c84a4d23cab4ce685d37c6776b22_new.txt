refactor: Centralize and simplify theming logic

Centralize theme application logic by delegating responsibilities from
Theme class to ThemeColor, ThemeAccent, and ThemeBase.

- ThemeColor now handles status bar, task description, and resource theme application.
- ThemeBase handles activity setting and context wrapping.
- ThemeAccent handles resource theme application.
- TaskListActivity now applies filter-specific themes earlier and more comprehensively.
- TaskListFragment no longer manages its own toolbar background or theme colors directly.

Rename values-w360dp/dimens.xml to values-w380dp/dimens.xml.
