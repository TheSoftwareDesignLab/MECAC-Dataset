fix: Improve TaskEditFragment lifecycle and navigation

Corrects fragment transaction handling for TaskEditFragment.
Uses runOnCommit for view visibility and fragment display to synchronize
with fragment lifecycle. Removes explicit back stack manipulation for TEF.
Ensures openTask receives the current filter when re-opening in single-pane layout.
