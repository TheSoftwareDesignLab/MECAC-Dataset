feat: Preserve task edit state across orientation changes

The task being edited is now saved and restored during configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation). This refines new task creation by temporarily marking untitled tasks for deletion, only saving them permanently once a title is entered. Abandoned untitled tasks are now explicitly deleted. Ensures a clean launch when opening TaskEditActivity from the widget.
