fix: Scroll to position during task reorder animation

Introduce a RecyclerView reference to the adapter to enable programmatic scrolling.
When tasks are reordered with animation, the view is now scrolled to the `fromPosition`
to ensure the moved item remains visible throughout the drag operation,
improving the user experience for long reorder gestures.

Bumps app version to 5.3.5 (code 507).
