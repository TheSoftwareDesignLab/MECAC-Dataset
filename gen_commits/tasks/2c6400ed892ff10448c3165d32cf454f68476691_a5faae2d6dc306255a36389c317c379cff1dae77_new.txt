fix: Update TaskAdapter to use notifyDataSetChanged

Replaced `notifyDataSetInvalidated()` calls with `notifyDataSetChanged()` in
TaskAdapter. This improves UI update efficiency and resolves potential
display glitches, especially when expanding tasks or adding details.
The custom `notifyDataSetInvalidated()` override has been removed.

Bumps app version to 3.3.2 (157).
