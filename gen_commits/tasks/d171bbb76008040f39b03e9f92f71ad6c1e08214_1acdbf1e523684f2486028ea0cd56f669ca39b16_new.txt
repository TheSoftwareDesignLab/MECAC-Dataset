i18n: Update and expand Korean translations

Refined existing strings for clarity in backup actions, Google Drive integration,
sorting options, and 'chips' description. Removed the singular form for Ntasks.
Added comprehensive translations for numerous new features and UI elements,
including automatic backups, list management, performance settings, location
permissions, default tags, and various date/time shortcuts.
