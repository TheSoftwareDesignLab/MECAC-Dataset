feat: Rework theming: separate base, color, and accent

The theming system has been refactored to allow for independent selection of a base theme (Light, Dark, Black), a primary color palette (e.g., Red, Blue Grey), and an accent color. This provides more granular customization for users.

Key changes include:
- Introduction of `p_theme_color` preference for primary color selection.
- Refactored `ThemeManager` to handle base, color, and accent themes separately.
- Theme application now uses `ContextThemeWrapper` to apply styles on top of the base theme.
- Removed toolbar separators from various layouts.
- Updated widget configuration to reflect the new theme structure.
