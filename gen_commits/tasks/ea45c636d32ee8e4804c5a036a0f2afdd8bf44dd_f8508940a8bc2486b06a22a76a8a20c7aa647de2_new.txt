feat: Add user-configurable layout direction

Allows users to explicitly set the app's layout direction (LTR/RTL) independently of the selected language or device locale.
- Refactored locale and directionality handling in `Locale` class and application initialization.
- Applied chosen directionality to dialogs, preferences, and widgets.
- Updated various XML layouts to use `textAlignment="viewStart"` and other direction-aware attributes for proper rendering.
- Changed widget update period from 24 hours to 30 minutes.
