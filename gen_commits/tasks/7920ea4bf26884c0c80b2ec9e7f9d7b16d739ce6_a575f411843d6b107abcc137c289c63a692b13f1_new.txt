feat(files): Enhance file attachment naming and storage

- Introduce `FileUtilities` to centralize descriptive and unique file name generation for attachments.
- Add `FileMetadata.NAME` to explicitly store generated file names for better identification.
- Update attachment creation workflows to use `FileUtilities` and persist the new `NAME`.
- Refactor `FilesControlSet` to display stored file names.
- Improve resource management in `ActFmSyncV2Provider` by ensuring cursor closure.
