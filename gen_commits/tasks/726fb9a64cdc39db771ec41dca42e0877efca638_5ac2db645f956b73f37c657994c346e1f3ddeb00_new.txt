refactor: Standardize UI text color and theming attributes

Migrate from custom `alpha` attributes and explicit `setAlpha()` calls to standard Android `android:attr/textColorPrimary`, `android:attr/textColorSecondary`, and `android:attr/textColorTertiary`.

This refactoring involves:
- Updating `ThemeBase` and `ThemeCache` to expose and resolve these standard text colors.
- Replacing `setTextAppearance()` calls and direct alpha manipulations with `setTextColor()` using the new theme colors across `TaskAdapter` and other control sets.
- Removing custom `TextAppearance` styles (e.g., `TextAppearance.TAd_ItemTitle`).
- Introducing `TaskEditTextPrimary` and `TaskEditTextHint` styles for consistent application of standard text colors in XML layouts.
- Refining color definitions in `res/values/colors.xml` and `res/values/dimens.xml` to align with new alpha values.
- Switching divider styling to use a dedicated `dividerColor` attribute.

This change improves consistency and maintainability of the application's UI theming.
