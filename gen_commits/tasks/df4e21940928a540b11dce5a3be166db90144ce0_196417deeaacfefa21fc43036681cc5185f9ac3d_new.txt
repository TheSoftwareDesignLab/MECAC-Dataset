feat: Add active activity tracking; improve RTM sync & notes

- Introduce `AndroidUtilities.setCurrentlyActive` and `getCurrentlyActiveActivity` to track the currently foreground activity.
- Integrate active activity tracking into `TaskListActivity` and `MilkPreferences`.
- Improve RTM note parsing to display notes chronologically (oldest first) and handle empty note lists.
- Close `MilkPreferences` activity automatically after initiating an RTM sync.
- Disable the RTM auto-sync interval preference in the settings.
