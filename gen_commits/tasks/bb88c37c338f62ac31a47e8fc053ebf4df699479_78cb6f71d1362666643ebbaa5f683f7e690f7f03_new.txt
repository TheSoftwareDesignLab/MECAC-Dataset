fix: Improve task row layouts for performance and alignment

Updated weighted LinearLayout elements to use `layout_width="0dip"` for optimal measurement and rendering performance. Removed superfluous `layout_alignParentRight` attribute from a TextView, as it's not applicable in its parent layout. Set `android:baselineAligned="false"` for a LinearLayout to prevent potential layout inconsistencies.
