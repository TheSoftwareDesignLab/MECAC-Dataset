refactor: Apply theme after super.onCreate and encapsulate logic

Move `ThemeService.applyTheme()` calls to after `super.onCreate()` in various activities. This ensures the activity's base initialization completes before custom theme application, preventing potential rendering issues or crashes.

Also, reduce visibility of `ThemeService.getTheme()` to `private` as it's an internal helper method, improving encapsulation.
