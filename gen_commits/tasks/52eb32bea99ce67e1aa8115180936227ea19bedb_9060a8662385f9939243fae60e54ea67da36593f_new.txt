feat: Apply theme-aware ripple effect to widget rows

Introduce visual feedback for widget task rows on Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and above.
Taps on widget items will now display a theme-appropriate ripple animation.
The default list selector has been disabled to allow the custom ripple to function correctly.
