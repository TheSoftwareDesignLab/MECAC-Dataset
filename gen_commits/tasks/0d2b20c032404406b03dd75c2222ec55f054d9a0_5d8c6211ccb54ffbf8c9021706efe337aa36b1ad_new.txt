refactor: Unify toolbar and menu styling across activities

Migrated toolbar setup from AppCompat.ActionBar to direct Toolbar interaction, utilizing `Toolbar.OnMenuItemClickListener`. Introduced `MenuColorizer.colorToolbar` for centralized icon and text tinting. Enhanced the theme system to support dynamic `actionBarPrimaryText`, `actionBarSecondaryText`, and `dark_status_bar` attributes, improving consistency for toolbars and status bars. Updated comment bar and tag UI elements to align with the new theme attributes and replaced raster camera icons with vector drawables.
