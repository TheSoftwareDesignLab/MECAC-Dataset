feat: Support GtasksFilter chips for Google Tasks

Generate specific GtasksFilter chips for tasks belonging to Google Task lists.
This ensures the correct filter type is applied when a user clicks the list chip.

The chip visibility condition was also updated to prevent showing a redundant
list chip if the current filter is already a GtasksFilter.
