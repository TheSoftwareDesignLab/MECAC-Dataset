refactor: MissedCallActivity to use standard dialog theme

Migrated MissedCallActivity to use the common Tasks.Dialog style for consistent appearance. This change removes custom translucent theme application and related unused UI elements (dismiss button, speech bubble). Configured the activity with singleTask launch mode and excludeFromRecents, updating intent flags accordingly.
