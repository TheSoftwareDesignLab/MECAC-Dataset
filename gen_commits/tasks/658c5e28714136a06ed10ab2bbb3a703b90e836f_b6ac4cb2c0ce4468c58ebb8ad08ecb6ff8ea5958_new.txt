feat: Replace MenuDrawer with native NavigationDrawer

Migrate the primary navigation system from the third-party MenuDrawer library
to Android's native DrawerLayout and NavigationDrawerFragment.

This change involves:
- Removing the MenuDrawer dependency and deleting FilterListFragment.
- Introducing NavigationDrawerFragment to manage filter lists and navigation.
- Adapting TaskListActivity and related components to the new drawer pattern.
- Consolidating menu items and simplifying TagSettingsActivity UI logic.
