refactor: Migrate to LocalMinimumInteractiveComponentSize

The LocalMinimumInteractiveComponentEnforcement API has been superseded by
LocalMinimumInteractiveComponentSize in Material 3. This updates the usage
to the new API, setting Dp.Unspecified to maintain the previous behavior of
disabling minimum interactive component size enforcement.
