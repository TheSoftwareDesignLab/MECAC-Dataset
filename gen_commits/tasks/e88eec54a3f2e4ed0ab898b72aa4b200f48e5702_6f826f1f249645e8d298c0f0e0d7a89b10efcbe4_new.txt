feat: Add title-only task row display mode

Introduces a new task row layout `task_adapter_row_title_only.xml` for a minimalist display option showing only the task's title.

The `TaskAdapter` and `TaskListFragment` are updated to support this new mode. In title-only mode, the adapter configures the title `TextView` for single-line display with truncation, and skips rendering of other task details, listeners, and appearance settings (like due dates, tags, and completion checkboxes) that are not present in this layout.
