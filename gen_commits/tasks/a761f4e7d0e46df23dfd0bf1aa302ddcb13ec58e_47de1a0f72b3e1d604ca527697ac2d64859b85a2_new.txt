refactor: Consolidate theme and status bar color application

Streamlines theme and status bar color management by combining related
logic into a single `applyThemeAndStatusBarColor` flow within `Theme.java`.
This change centralizes theme application, ensuring consistency across
activities. `LocationPickerActivity` theme application is also adjusted
to align with the new flow via its `inject` method.

- Removed redundant separate calls to apply theme and status bar color.
- Renamed `ThemeAccent.apply` to `applyStyle` and adjusted its visibility.
