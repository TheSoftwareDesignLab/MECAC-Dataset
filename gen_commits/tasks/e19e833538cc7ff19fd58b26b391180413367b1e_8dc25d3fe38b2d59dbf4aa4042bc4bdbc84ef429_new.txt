feat(nl): Update Dutch backup strings for clarity and new feature

This commit makes several improvements to the Dutch localization for backup-related features:
- Clarified the meaning of existing backup texts, changing "Taken importeren" to "Back-up importeren" and "Taken exporteren" to "Back-up nu uitvoeren" for better accuracy.
- Updated "Kopieer naar Google Drive" to "Back-up naar Google Drive" for consistency.
- Added a new string for "Automatische back-ups" in preparation for or in support of a related feature.
