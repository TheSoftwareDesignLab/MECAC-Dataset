fix(cs): Correct plurals and refine wording in Czech strings

- Corrected plural forms for 'tasks' (Ntasks) to properly handle 'few' quantities.
- Changed "Později…" (Later…) to "Odložit" (Snooze) for clearer action text.
- Adjusted grammar and consistency for various calendar and task-related messages.
