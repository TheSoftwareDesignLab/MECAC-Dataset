fix: Refine intro task filtering and activity save flow

Improved ActFm sync to prevent introductory tasks from syncing by matching their titles against predefined string resources, rather than relying on task ID ranges. This provides a more robust filtering mechanism. For newly created non-intro tasks, ensured all merged values are pushed for sync.

In `TaskEditActivity`, explicitly set `shouldSaveState = false` before finishing on a manual save. This prevents unnecessary state saving and addresses potential issues with activity lifecycle management.

Removed unused `StartupService` import.
