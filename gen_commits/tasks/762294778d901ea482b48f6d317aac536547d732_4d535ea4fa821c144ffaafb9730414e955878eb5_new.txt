refactor: Adjust task row height and vertical alignment

Changed task list item height from fixed `70dip` to `wrap_content` with a `minHeight` of `57dip` in both `task_adapter_row.xml` and `task_adapter_draggable_row.xml`.
Vertically centered content within task rows for better display.
Removed the `importance` indicator bar from `task_adapter_draggable_row.xml`.
