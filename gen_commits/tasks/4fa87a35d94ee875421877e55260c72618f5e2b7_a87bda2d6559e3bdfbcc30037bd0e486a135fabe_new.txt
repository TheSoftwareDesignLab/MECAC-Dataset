fix: Prevent EditText crashes during padding calculation

Introduces `ErrorCatchingEditText` to gracefully handle exceptions that
may occur when calling `getExtendedPaddingTop()` and `getExtendedPaddingBottom()`.
This prevents potential crashes on certain Android versions or custom ROMs,
making the UI more robust.
