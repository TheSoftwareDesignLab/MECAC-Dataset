refactor(uk): Refine existing translations and add new string

Improve clarity, grammar, and consistency for various Ukrainian strings:
* Corrected escaping for `CFC_importance_text`.
* Standardized "tag" terminology (`ярлик` to `тег`).
* Enhanced phrasing for UI elements like widget checkboxes, attachment/backup directories, badges description, network error, and license summary.
* Added translation for `hide_check_button`.
