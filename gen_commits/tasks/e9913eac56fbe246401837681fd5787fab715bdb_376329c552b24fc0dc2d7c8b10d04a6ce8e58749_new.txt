feat: Integrate ActionBarSherlock and refactor to use fragments

This commit introduces ActionBarSherlock v3.4.2 to provide a consistent
action bar experience across all Android versions (1.6+).

Key changes include:
- Added the ActionBarSherlock library and its associated modules (samples, tests, plugins).
- Refactored `TaskListActivity` and `FilterListActivity` to extend `Fragment`.
- Introduced new `AstridWrapperActivity` as a base class, along with
  `TaskListWrapperActivity`, `FilterListWrapperActivity`, and
  `TagViewWrapperActivity` to host fragments.
- Updated application themes to inherit from `Theme.Sherlock` and
  `Theme.Sherlock.Light`.
- Modified layout XMLs to accommodate fragment-based UI and hide old header
  elements, enabling multi-pane layouts for tablets.
- Adjusted Proguard rules and project references for library inclusion.
- Ensured proper context and view access for fragments.
- Integrated ActionBarSherlock map and preference plugins.
