refactor: Consolidate to a single light theme

Removes the dark theme option, making the light theme the default and only available theme.

This change includes:
*   Removing the 'use dark theme' preference and its related logic from settings and default specifications.
*   Updating theme application methods in `ActivityPreferences` to always use the light theme for the main app and dialogs.
*   Refactoring `Tasks` and `Tasks.Dialog` styles to represent the light theme, and removing the separate `Tasks.Light` style.
*   Deleting numerous dark theme-specific drawable resources and string keys.
*   Removing an unused `GlobalEventReceiver` from the manifest.
*   Consolidating API-level specific styles into `values-v11/styles.xml`.
*   Updating `TextAppearance` references across layouts and code.
