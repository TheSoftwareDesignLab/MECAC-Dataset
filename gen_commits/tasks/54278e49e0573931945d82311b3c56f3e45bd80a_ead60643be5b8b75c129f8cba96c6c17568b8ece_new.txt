refactor: Migrate navigation drawer to RecyclerView

The navigation drawer has been refactored to use `RecyclerView` instead of `ListView`.
This change involved:
- Introducing a dedicated `NavigationDrawerAdapter` which leverages `ListAdapter` and `DiffUtil` for efficient updates.
- Implementing `areItemsTheSame` and `areContentsTheSame` methods in `FilterListItem` and all its subclasses to support `DiffUtil`.
- Moving navigation drawer specific presentation and interaction logic from `FilterAdapter` into `NavigationDrawerAdapter` and `FilterViewHolder`.
- Adding new drawable resources for selected item backgrounds.
This migration improves the performance and maintainability of the navigation drawer.
