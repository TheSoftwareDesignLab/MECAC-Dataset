feat(lt): Add new strings and refine existing translations

This commit introduces a comprehensive update to the Lithuanian localization.
It includes corrections for several existing phrases like "no date", "no time",
and filter operators (OR, AND, NOT) for consistency and accuracy. Many new
string resources have also been added to support various UI elements, settings,
and features.
