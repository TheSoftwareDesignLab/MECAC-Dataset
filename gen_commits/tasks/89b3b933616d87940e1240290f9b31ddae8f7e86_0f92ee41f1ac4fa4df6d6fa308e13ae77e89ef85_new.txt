refactor: Migrate widget opacity preference and improve display

Introduces a new preference key for widget opacity (v2) while deprecating the old one.
Includes logic to migrate existing user opacity settings to the new key, ensuring backward compatibility.
Updates the widget configuration dialog to use NumberFormat for a more consistent and precise percentage display of opacity.
