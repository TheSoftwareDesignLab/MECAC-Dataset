feat: Allow customizing places with colors and icons

Upgrade database to version 73, adding `place_color` and `place_icon` to the `places` table.
Introduce `PlaceSettingsActivity` to manage existing places, enabling users to set custom names, colors, and icons.
Update `LocationFilter` and `LocationPickerAdapter` to leverage and display these new customization options.
Rename "Locations" to "Places" in the UI for consistency.
