feat: Configure default phone layout for Nook and bump version

Introduces market strategy to default to phone layout for Nook devices.
The 'force_phone_layout' preference will now be set to true by default
on devices using the Nook market strategy.

Also removes 'swipe_lists_enabled' from excluded settings for some
market strategies, making it available.

Bumps app version to 4.3.2.1 and build code to 281.
