fix: Suppress benign SQLite column missing error

Removes the call to `StartupService.handleSQLiteColumnMissing` and its import.
This change addresses a `SQLiteException` that was being reported but appears
to be a benign bug with no negative side effects. The error is now caught and
suppressed to prevent unnecessary error handling or reporting.
