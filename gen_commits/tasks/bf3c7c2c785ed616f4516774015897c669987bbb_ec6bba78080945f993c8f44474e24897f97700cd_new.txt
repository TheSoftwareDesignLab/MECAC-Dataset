refactor: Type FilterAdapter.selected as Filter

Refactors `FilterAdapter` to use `Filter` directly for the `selected` member, improving type safety.
- Changes `selected` member type from `FilterListItem` to `Filter`.
- Updates `setData` methods to correctly preserve and handle the selected filter.
- Adds `getFilter` helper method for explicit casting.
- Ensures `notifyDataSetChanged()` is invoked when `setSelected()` to refresh the UI.
- Removes direct `adapter.setSelected()` call from `NavigationDrawerFragment`, relying on the adapter's internal update logic.
