feat: Add master opacity control for widget preferences

Introduces a unified opacity slider that controls header, row, and
footer opacities simultaneously. Individual opacity settings are now
grouped under a new 'Opacity' category within advanced preferences.

If individual opacities differ, the advanced section automatically
expands to reveal the specific controls. Header opacity is now
dependent on the 'Show header' setting.

Renames 'Empty space' widget settings to 'Footer settings' for clarity.
