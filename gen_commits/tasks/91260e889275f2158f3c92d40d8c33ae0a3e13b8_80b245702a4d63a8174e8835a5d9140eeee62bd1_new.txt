refactor: Extract QueryPreferences interface

Introduces a new `QueryPreferences` interface to encapsulate settings related to task list queries. This improves modularity by allowing components to depend on a focused interface rather than the broader `Preferences` class. Consumers such as `SortHelper` and `TaskListQuery` are updated to use the new interface.
