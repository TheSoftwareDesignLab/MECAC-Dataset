feat: Introduce gesture navigation to filter list

Adds gesture recognition to the TaskListActivity, allowing users to
swipe a predefined gesture (e.g., "nav_filters") to navigate
directly to the FilterListActivity.

- Implemented gesture overlay in task_list_activity.xml.
- Loaded gesture definitions from R.raw.gestures.
- Updated ic_menu_refresh.png drawable.
- Initialized ContextManager in LocaleEditAlerts.
- Ensured SharedPreferences use application context to prevent leaks.
- Improved Javadoc for DateUtilities formatting methods.
