refactor: Consolidate widget opacity preference keys

This change unifies the widget opacity preference keys by renaming `PREF_WIDGET_OPACITY` to refer to the 'widget-opacity-v2-' string and removing the now redundant `PREF_WIDGET_OPACITY_V2` constant. It also removes the legacy opacity migration logic, simplifying preference retrieval and storage.
