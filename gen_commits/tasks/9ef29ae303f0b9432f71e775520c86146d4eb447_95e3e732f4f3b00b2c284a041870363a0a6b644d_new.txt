refactor: Unify getRelativeDay signature and respect string casing

The overloaded 'getRelativeDay(Context, long)' method has been removed,
requiring all calls to explicitly provide the 'abbreviated' boolean.
Additionally, 'getRelativeDay' no longer forces its output to lowercase,
allowing string resources (e.g., Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday) to be used
with their original capitalization.
