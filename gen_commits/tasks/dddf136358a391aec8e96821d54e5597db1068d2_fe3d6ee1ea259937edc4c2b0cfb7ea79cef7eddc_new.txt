refactor: Extract widget toolbar into shared layout

Consolidates the common title and action button UI elements found in various widget headers into a new `widget_toolbar.xml` layout. This reduces duplication and improves maintainability across `scrollable_widget_dark.xml`, `scrollable_widget_light.xml`, `widget_initialized.xml`, `widget_initialized_dark.xml`, and `widget_loading.xml`.

The `widget_header` LinearLayouts in these files now use an `<include>` tag, and their orientation and height attributes have been adjusted accordingly. Separator ImageView, where present, was also relocated within the header.
