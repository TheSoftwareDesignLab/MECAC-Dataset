feat: Add dedicated widget settings screen

Introduces a new "Widgets" preferences screen to manage installed app widgets. This screen dynamically lists all currently installed widgets, allowing users to tap on an entry to reconfigure that specific widget.

The "Widgets" preference entry in the main settings is only visible if there is at least one widget installed.
Includes a new widget icon.
