refactor: Unify quick add task opening and remove wrapper activities

This refactors the quick add task logic in `TaskListActivity` to use a listener (`mListener.onTaskListItemClicked`) instead of direct `startActivityForResult`. This allows for more flexible task detail presentation, such as opening in a fragment alongside the list on tablet layouts.

The `TagViewWrapperActivity` has been removed, and redundant `getOnLongClickQuickAddIntent` implementations are no longer needed, simplifying the codebase. A minor layout adjustment for large landscape screens was also included.
