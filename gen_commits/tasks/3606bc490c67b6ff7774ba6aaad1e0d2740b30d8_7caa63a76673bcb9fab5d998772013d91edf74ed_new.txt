fix: Consistently open task list fragment after loading

The `openTaskListFragment` method is now always invoked via `doOnSuccess`
after a `TaskListFragment` is provided by the Single, regardless of
whether it's a newly created or an existing instance. This ensures
consistent initialization and display logic for the fragment.
