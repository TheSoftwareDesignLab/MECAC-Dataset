feat(pt-BR): Add extensive localization for new features

This commit introduces a comprehensive set of new string resources for Brazilian Portuguese. These strings support various new functionalities, including advanced widget configuration, subscription management, detailed account synchronization options (EteSync, CalDAV, Google Tasks), new UI components (chips, places), and numerous task management enhancements (subtasks, sorting, performance).

Additionally, existing translations for 'backup directory' and 'launcher icon' have been refined for better accuracy. A minor update to the XML declaration formatting was also included.
