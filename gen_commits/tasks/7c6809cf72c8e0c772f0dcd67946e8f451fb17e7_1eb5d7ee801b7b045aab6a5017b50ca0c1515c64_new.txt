fix: Dismiss action mode on drawer interaction and drag

The action mode is now automatically dismissed when the navigation drawer state changes (opened or closed), preventing UI inconsistencies. Drag-and-drop reordering is properly integrated with multi-selection: initiating a drag operation will clear existing selections and terminate the action mode if active. Multi-selection actions (delete, copy) now explicitly finish the action mode after execution. Additionally, `DrawerLayout` listeners are now managed correctly with `addDrawerListener` and `removeDrawerListener`.
