feat(caldav): Consolidate and improve task sorting

Removes redundant `cd_remote_order` and `cd_moved` columns from CaldavTask
schema, simplifying the model. Implements a robust manual sorting and
hierarchy adjustment for CalDAV tasks, persisting order via the
`X-APPLE-SORT-ORDER` iCalendar property. Refactors adapter logic and
introduces new DAO methods for atomic order updates.
