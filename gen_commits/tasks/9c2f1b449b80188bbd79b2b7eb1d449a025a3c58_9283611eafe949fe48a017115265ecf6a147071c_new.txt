refactor: Align overdue color with material error palette

Updated the 'overdue' color definition in both day and night themes to use
standard material design error colors. This change replaces the custom
`overdue_87` color with `error_color_material_light` and
`error_color_material_dark` for improved consistency and adherence to
the material design system.
