feat: Dynamically theme EditText backgrounds and text colors

Introduces `asEditTextBackground` and `asTextColor` theme attributes to replace hardcoded drawables and colors in various layouts. This allows EditText components to automatically adapt their appearance based on the active app theme. Includes a new `edit_title_background_dark.xml` for dark theme support.
