feat: Add analytics for widget creation and timer start

This commit introduces new analytics events to track user interactions:
- When a new scrollable widget is added to the homescreen.
- When a new shortcut widget is added to the homescreen.
- When a task timer is initiated.

Additionally, the `Tracker` has been updated to conditionally set the event label,
allowing events to be defined without a label if not relevant.
