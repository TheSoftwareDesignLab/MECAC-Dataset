refactor: Standardize theme/color picker; update launcher icons

Revamps the theme and color selection system by introducing a generic 'Pickable' interface and Parcelable implementation for theme, color, accent, and widget background items. This makes the color picker more flexible and reusable.

Also, updates the app's launcher icons and adjusts the default primary theme color.
