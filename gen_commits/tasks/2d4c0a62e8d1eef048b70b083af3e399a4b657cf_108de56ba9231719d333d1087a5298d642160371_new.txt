feat: Add long-click handling for linkified text

The Linkify utility now accepts an `onLongClick` runnable, allowing custom actions when a detected link is long-pressed.
Task list items (name and description) leverage this for `onRowBodyLongClick`, with additional TextView listeners for full text area long-press detection.
