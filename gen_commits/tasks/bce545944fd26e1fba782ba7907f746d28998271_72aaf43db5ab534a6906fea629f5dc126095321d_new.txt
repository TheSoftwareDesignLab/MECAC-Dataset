feat: Improve text directionality in input fields

Apply `TextDirection.Content` to `textStyle` in Compose text input fields.
Remove explicit `textAlignment` properties from traditional `EditText` views.
This ensures text direction is determined by the content itself, enhancing support for mixed-direction and RTL languages.
