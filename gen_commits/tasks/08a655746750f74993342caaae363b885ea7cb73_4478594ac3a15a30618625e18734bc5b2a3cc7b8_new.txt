perf(widget): Improve scrollable widget memory by using cursor directly

Refactor ScrollableViewsFactory to fetch tasks directly via a Cursor from TaskDao,
instead of loading all tasks into a List<Task> upfront.

This significantly reduces memory usage, especially for widgets displaying
a large number of tasks, as task objects are now instantiated on demand.

Moved database query execution logic into a new TaskDao.getCursor method
to support direct cursor usage and remove direct Database dependency from
widget components.
