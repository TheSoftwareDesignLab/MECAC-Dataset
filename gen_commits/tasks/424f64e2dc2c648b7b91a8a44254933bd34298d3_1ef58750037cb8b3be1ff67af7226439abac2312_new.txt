fix: Preserve scroll state during batched list updates

- Remove manual scroll handling in `onMoved` to prevent incorrect scrolling behavior.
- Simplify `DiffUtil` calculation logic by always passing the `detectMoves` parameter directly.
- Save and restore RecyclerView's layout manager state (e.g., scroll position) when applying multiple diff updates from the queue. This ensures the user's scroll position is maintained and prevents unexpected jumps.
- Always dispatch `DiffResult` updates, eliminating the fallback to `notifyDataSetChanged()`.
