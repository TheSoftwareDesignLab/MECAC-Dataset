feat: Enhance scrollable widget configurability and default size

Adds `reconfigurable` and `configuration_optional` widget features, allowing users to adjust settings post-placement and enabling direct widget addition without initial setup.
Sets `targetCellHeight` and `targetCellWidth` to 2, providing a suggested default size for better layout consistency.
