feat(de): Add sharing strings and improve existing translations

This commit introduces new German string resources to support upcoming
list sharing and invitation features, as well as a new map theme option.

Additionally, it corrects a typo in "Autorisierung abgebrochen" and
standardizes "Tasks.org-Account" to "Tasks.org-Konto" for better
consistency in the German localization.
