refactor: Migrate scrollable widget root layout to RelativeLayout

Changed the root layout from LinearLayout to RelativeLayout for better
positioning flexibility. Removed an unnecessary nested RelativeLayout and
explicitly positioned the background, list, and empty view using
`layout_below` attribute. Also removed old XML comments.
