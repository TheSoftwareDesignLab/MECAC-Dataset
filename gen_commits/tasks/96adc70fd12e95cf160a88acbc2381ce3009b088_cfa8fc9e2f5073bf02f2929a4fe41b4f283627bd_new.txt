refactor: Unify widget intent extras and decouple fragments

Renamed `TOKEN_ID` to `EXTRA_ID` and introduced `EXTRA_FILTER` in `TasksWidget`.
Replaced direct references to `TaskListFragment` constants with widget-specific extras to decouple dependencies.
Removed unused imports of `TaskEditFragment` and `TaskListFragment`.
Renamed `getListIntent` to `getOpenListIntent` in `WidgetHelper` for improved clarity.
Streamlined intent creation for widget actions using anonymous inner classes.
