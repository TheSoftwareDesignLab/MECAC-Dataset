feat: Allow customization of chip style and appearance

Users can now configure the visual style of chips in the app.
New preferences have been added for:
- Chip style: Choose between outlined or filled chips.
- Chip appearance: Select to show text and icon, text only, or icon only.

The `ChipProvider` has been refactored to dynamically apply these settings, and relevant UI components like `RemoteListFragment` have been updated to support the new styling options.
