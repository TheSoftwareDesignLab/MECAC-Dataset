fix: Separate TagSettingsActivity for tablet theming

Introduces a dedicated `TagSettingsActivityTablet` to resolve UI and theming
inconsistencies on tablet-sized devices. Previously, `TagSettingsActivity`
was used for both phones and tablets, leading to issues with dialog theme
application.

The new `TagSettingsActivityTablet` extends `TagSettingsActivity` and is
declared separately in the manifest with the appropriate dialog theme.
Activity launching logic now dynamically selects between `TagSettingsActivity`
and `TagSettingsActivityTablet` based on device size, ensuring correct UI.

Also sets `android:windowSoftInputMode="stateHidden"` for `TagSettingsActivity`.
