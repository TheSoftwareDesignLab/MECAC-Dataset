refactor: Use ColorStateList for task name styling

Refactors task name coloring, particularly for completed tasks, to leverage
ColorStateList resources. This change utilizes `android:state_enabled`
to define text appearance, removing direct `setTextColor` calls in `TaskAdapter`
and improving theme integration for primary text colors (day/night).
