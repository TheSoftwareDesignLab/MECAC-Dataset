feat: Introduce SYNCHRONIZE constant to control sync features

Adds a `Constants.SYNCHRONIZE` boolean flag to conditionally enable or disable synchronization functionality.

This flag is used to:
- Control the display of synchronization buttons and menu items.
- Conditionally schedule the synchronization service on startup and after task edits.
- Guard the execution of the `synchronize()` method.
