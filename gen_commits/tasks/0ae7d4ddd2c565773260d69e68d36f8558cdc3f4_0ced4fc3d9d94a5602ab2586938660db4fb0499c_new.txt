fix: Correctly apply sort and flag preferences for tasks

- Corrected the order of arguments passed to the query adjustment method in `TasksWidget`, resolving an issue where sort flags and sort values were swapped, leading to incorrect task ordering in the widget.
- Ensured that `sortFlags` and `sortSort` are consistently loaded from user preferences in `TaskListActivity.onCreate` to guarantee the correct sorting and filtering is applied upon activity creation.
- Refactored method name `adjustSortAndFlags` to `adjustQueryForFlagsAndSort` for clarity.
- Renamed preference keys `PREF_SORT_FLAGS` (`tla_flags` to `sort_flags`) and `PREF_SORT_SORT` (`tla_sort` to `sort_sort`) for better readability and consistency.
