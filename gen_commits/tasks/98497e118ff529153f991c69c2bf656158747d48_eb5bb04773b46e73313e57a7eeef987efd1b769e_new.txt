fix: Ensure ThemePickerDialog renders with consistent base theme

Introduces `Theme.withBaseTheme()` for immutably changing a theme's base
and `DialogBuilder.newDialog(Theme)` to explicitly set a dialog's theme.
These are used to ensure `ThemePickerDialog` uses a consistent base theme
(e.g., a dark theme) when the 'Themes' color palette is active,
improving display consistency for the theme options.
