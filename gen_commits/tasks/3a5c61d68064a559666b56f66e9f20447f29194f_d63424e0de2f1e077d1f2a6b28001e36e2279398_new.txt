refactor: Migrate task lists from ListView to RecyclerView

Replaced ListView with RecyclerView for all task lists, including the custom DraggableListView.
Introduced TaskListRecyclerAdapter to manage RecyclerView interactions, implementing drag-and-drop reordering and swipe-to-indent/unindent functionality via ItemTouchHelper.
Refactored TaskListFragment, TaskAdapter, and subtask/Gtasks helper classes to adapt to the new RecyclerView architecture.
Updated UI layouts and theme attributes for modern Android design and RecyclerView compatibility.
