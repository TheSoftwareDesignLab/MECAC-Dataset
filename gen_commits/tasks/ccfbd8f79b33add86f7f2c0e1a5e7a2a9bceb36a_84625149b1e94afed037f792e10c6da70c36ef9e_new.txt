refactor: Move GCal event deletion to GCalHelper

Moved the static deleteTaskEvent method from GCalControlSet to a new
GCalHelper class. This refactors the Google Calendar event deletion
logic into a dedicated helper, improving modularity and separation
of concerns. All call sites have been updated.
