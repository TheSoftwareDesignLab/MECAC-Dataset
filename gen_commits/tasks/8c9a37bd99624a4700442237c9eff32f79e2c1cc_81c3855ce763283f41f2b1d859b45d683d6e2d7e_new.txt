feat: Auto-update widget filter on tag rename

This change ensures that widgets displaying tasks associated with a specific
tag remain consistent even if the tag is renamed. The widget now stores
the tag's ID and checks for name changes. If a rename is detected,
the widget's filter and title are automatically updated to reflect
the new tag name, preventing stale or incorrect displays.
