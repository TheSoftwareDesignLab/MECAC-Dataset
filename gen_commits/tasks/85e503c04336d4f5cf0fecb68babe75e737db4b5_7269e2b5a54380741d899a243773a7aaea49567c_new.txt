feat: Redesign tasks widget with dynamic content and theming

- Replaced static task and separator views with dynamic inflation of `widget_row` and `widget_separator` layouts.
- Implemented support for different themes, applying appropriate colors and drawables to the widget header, body, title, button, and separator based on the user's theme.
- Updated widget header styling, dimensions, and content alignment.
- Removed deprecated 9-patch frame drawables and updated widget backgrounds.
- Added a trigger to update the widget when the task list activity is refreshed.
