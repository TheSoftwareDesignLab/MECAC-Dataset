refactor: Migrate action icons to theme attributes

Introduced `ResourceResolver` to dynamically resolve theme-specific drawables via attributes.
Refactored `TagSettingsActivity` and `TaskEditFragment` to use `ResourceResolver` for action icons.
Simplified `ThemeService` by removing internal logic for action icon theme variations and `filterThemeFlags`, now primarily handling filter icons.
Defined new theme attributes for action icons in `attrs.xml` and updated `styles.xml` to specify their theme-dependent drawables.
Removed several unused styles from `styles.xml`.
