refactor: Simplify swipe between lists preference

The 'swipe between lists' preference has been converted from a ListPreference (with integer performance modes) to a simple CheckBoxPreference (boolean enable/disable).
User-configurable performance modes have been removed, and the offscreen page limit is now hardcoded to 3 when swipe is enabled.
Existing user preferences for the old setting will be migrated to the new boolean setting.
