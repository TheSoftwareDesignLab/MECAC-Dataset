refactor(eo): Refine 'ring' and 'add reminder' translations

- Updated "add_reminder" from "Aldoni memorigilon" (Add reminder) to
  "Memorigi" (Remind) for conciseness.
- Replaced "Sonori" with "Soni" in "ring_once", "ring_nonstop", and
  "ring_five_times" strings. "Soni" (to sound) is a more general verb
  than "Sonori" (to ring a bell/chime).
- Ensured file ends with a newline.
