fix: Use correct title and text for reminders

Corrects the logic for displaying reminder notifications to ensure the
task's actual title is used for the notification title and ticker text.
The app name is now consistently used for the notification's content text.
Updates `EXTRAS_TITLE` usage across components to pass the task title.

Bumps app version to 4.7.8 (build 349).
