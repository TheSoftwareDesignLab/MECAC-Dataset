refactor(nl): Standardize calendar and event terminology

Standardizes the Dutch translation by consistently using "Agenda" instead of "Kalender".
Updates "gebeurtenis" to "item" or "agenda-item" in various contexts for clarity.
Includes minor capitalization and punctuation adjustments, and adds a new string for calendar event creation.
