feat: Add new 'Baby Blue' theme

Introduces a new theme option, 'Baby Blue' (internally 'white-alt'),
offering an alternative visual style for the app.

This theme includes:
- New drawable assets and selectors for headers, comments, lists, and menu buttons.
- New theme attributes (`asHeaderTextColor`, `asHeaderTextColorInverse`) to allow theme-specific header text coloring.
- Updated `ThemeService` to manage the new theme and provide themeable icons for action bar items (mic, close, save).
- Changes the default theme for Astrid Lite to 'Baby Blue'.
- Applies the new theme to widgets.
