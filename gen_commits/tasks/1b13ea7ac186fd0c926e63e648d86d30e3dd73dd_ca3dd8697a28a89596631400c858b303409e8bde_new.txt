fix: Prevent multiple TaskListActivity instances from shortcuts

Set `launchMode="singleTask"` for `ShortcutActivity` to ensure that opening a shortcut multiple times reuses the existing task list activity instance. This improves navigation and prevents redundant activity stacking.

The logic for creating shortcut intents has also been refactored and moved from `ShortcutActivity` to `FilterShortcutActivity` for better encapsulation.
