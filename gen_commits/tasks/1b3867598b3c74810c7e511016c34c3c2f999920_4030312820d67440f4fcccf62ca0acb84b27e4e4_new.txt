refactor: Remove internal color index from theme objects

The 'index' property has been removed from ThemeColor and ThemeAccent classes.
Previously, these objects carried an integer index to identify their position in a predefined color palette.
This mapping logic has been centralized in a new 'Upgrader.getLegacyColor' method, which now maps old integer indices directly to R.color resources.

This simplifies the ThemeColor and ThemeAccent objects by removing redundant state and clarifying color lookup. Color palette pickers now work directly with list positions instead of relying on an internal 'index' property.
