refactor(eu): Refine Basque translation

Updated strings.xml for the Basque language (eu). This commit systematically replaces 'egiteko' with 'zeregin' for task-related terms, improves grammatical phrasing, applies correct hyphenation for compound words, and uses more precise vocabulary for concepts like 'completed' and 'timer controls'.
