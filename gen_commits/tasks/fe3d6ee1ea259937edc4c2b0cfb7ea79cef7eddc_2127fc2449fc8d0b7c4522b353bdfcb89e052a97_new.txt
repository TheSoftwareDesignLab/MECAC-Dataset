feat: Add option to hide task checkboxes in widgets

Users can now configure task widgets to hide the completion checkboxes.
This new option is available on Android Honeycomb (API 11) and newer.
The 'Show due date' option has also been renamed to 'Hide due dates' for consistency, inverting its UI logic.
