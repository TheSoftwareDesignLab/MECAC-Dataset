feat: Add descriptive Spanish text for Eisenhower filter boxes

Updates the Spanish localization for the Eisenhower matrix filter options
to be more descriptive. Previously, the strings were simply "Eisenhower
caja X". They are now explicit, e.g., "Importante y urgente" for Box 1,
improving clarity and usability for Spanish-speaking users.
