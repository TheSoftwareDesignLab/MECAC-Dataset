refactor: Explicitly apply theme to Compose UI components

The `TasksTheme` Composable now accepts an explicit `theme` index, sourced from an injected `Theme` object. This change centralizes theme resolution and ensures consistent application of the selected theme across various Compose UI components, replacing prior implicit theme detection. Distinct `ColorScheme` definitions for light, dark, black, and wallpaper themes are introduced.
