feat: Conditionally enable swipe list performance preference

The 'Swipe list performance' preference is now enabled only when 'Force phone layout' is active on tablet devices. This ensures the preference is only configurable when the relevant layout is in use.

The preference listener for 'Force phone layout' was updated to dynamically manage the enabled state of the swipe performance option. The preference was also reordered in preferences.xml for better grouping.
