fix: Correct premium speech bubble percentage display

The `premium_speech_bubble_2` string incorrectly displayed "25%%" instead of "25%".
This commit removes the redundant '%' across all language `strings.xml` files.
Additionally, `TranslationTests` were updated to exclude this specific string from format specifier validation, as it now contains a literal '%' character.
