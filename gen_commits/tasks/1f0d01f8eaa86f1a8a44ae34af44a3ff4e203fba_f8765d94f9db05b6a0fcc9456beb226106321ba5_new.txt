feat: Show Sort menu by default in Astrid Lite

The `p_show_menu_sort` preference is now `true` by default in `AstridLitePreferenceSpec`, making the Sort menu item visible to users.
The `TLA_menu_sort` string was simplified from "Sort & Subtasks" to "Sort" for a cleaner UI.
The notes input field (`control_set_notes.xml`) now uses `?attr/asTextColor` for consistent theming.
