fix: Ensure pager height is correct for updates tab

The pager height might not be accurately set immediately after switching
to the updates tab. This change introduces a 500ms delay to re-evaluate
and set the pager height, ensuring it correctly displays the content
after the UI has settled and preventing potential layout glitches.
