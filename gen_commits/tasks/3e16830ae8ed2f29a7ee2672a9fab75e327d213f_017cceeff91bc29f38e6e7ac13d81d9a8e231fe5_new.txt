refactor: Simplify layout to single and double pane modes

Removes the LAYOUT_TRIPLE constant and all associated logic for a triple pane UI. This change streamlines layout management, focusing on single and double pane configurations.

- Eliminates tablet-specific UI behaviors, such as the static menu drawer.
- Deletes the landscape 3-pane XML layout and adapts the portrait 3-pane XML to a standard 2-pane structure.
- Simplifies fragment layout initialization and visibility management across activities.
