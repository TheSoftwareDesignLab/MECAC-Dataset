refactor: Decouple ThemeAccent color resolution from ThemeCache

ThemeAccent objects now dynamically resolve their colorSecondary attribute based on their style and context, instead of relying on ThemeCache to provide pre-resolved colors.

- ThemeCache no longer stores or manages ThemeAccent objects.
- ThemeAccent.ACCENTS array is now public for direct access.
- Introduced new _a100 color variants and values-night/accents.xml for consistent accent colors in night mode.
- Deprecated ThemeAccent.getAccentColor().
