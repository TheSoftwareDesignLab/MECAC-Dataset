refactor: Unify navigation drawer actions and simplify adapter

Ensure all navigation drawer item actions, including opening filters and starting activities, are executed after the drawer has fully closed for a consistent user experience.

Simplify the NavigationDrawerAdapter by removing internal logic for managing selected filters. Refactor drawer background drawables to target API 21+ and update selectors to use color resources.
