feat(widget): Redesign Power Widget layout and scrolling

Reorganized widget layout XML (`widget_power_44.xml`) for improved appearance.
Replaced `CheckBox` with `ImageButton` for task completion, allowing for custom drawables (`btn_check_buttonless_off`/`on`).
Moved scroll up/down controls to the header area and implemented them as `ImageButton`s with state-aware drawables.
Consolidated drawable assets by migrating many density-specific PNGs from `drawable-mdpi` to the generic `drawable` folder and introducing XML selectors for button states.
Enhanced task completion tracking in `PowerWidget.java` to temporarily highlight recently completed tasks.
Added new encouragement messages for the widget.
Updated widget action intent package prefixes.
