fix: Always apply filter values for new tasks from widgets

The `filter.valuesForNewTasks` logic was previously only applied when opening the
task edit fragment from a widget on tablet devices. This commit moves the logic
outside the `if (tablet)` check, ensuring that preset values defined in a filter
are consistently passed to the new task creation intent, regardless of the
device form factor.
