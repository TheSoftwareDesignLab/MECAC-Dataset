refactor: Improve splash screen initialization and theme handling

Reorders splash screen installation to occur after super.onCreate to ensure
correct theme application. Removes the now unnecessary `postSplashScreenTheme`
item from `theme.xml`. Also removes the unused `getLayoutInflater` method from
`Theme.kt` as part of general cleanup.
