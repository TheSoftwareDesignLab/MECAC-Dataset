fix: Improve RTL icon mirroring, prevent help icon flip for Hebrew

Migrate directional icons like 'ArrowBack' to use `Icons.AutoMirrored` for automatic mirroring in Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts.

Implement specific handling for the 'Help' icon to prevent it from mirroring when the locale is Hebrew. While Hebrew is an RTL language, the help icon (question mark) typically does not flip visually.
