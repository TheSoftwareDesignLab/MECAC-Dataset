fix: Improve theme compatibility for older Android versions

Addresses theme rendering issues and preference compatibility on older Android versions.

Introduces version-specific GreenDroid themes:
- `values/gd_themes.xml` now uses `Theme` as parent for SDK < 5.
- A new `values-v5/gd_themes.xml` defines themes for SDK >= 5, using `Theme.Wallpaper`.
This ensures correct theme application based on the Android API level.

The "transparent" preference is also disabled for Android versions below SDK 5 to avoid
potential visual glitches or crashes.

Bumps application version to 3.7.3.1 (176).
