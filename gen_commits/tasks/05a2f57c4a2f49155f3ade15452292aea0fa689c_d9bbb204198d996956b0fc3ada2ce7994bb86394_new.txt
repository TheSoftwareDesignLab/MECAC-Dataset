fix: Robustify filter switching and receiver unregistration

*   Ensure `FilterListFragment#switchToActiveTasks` always selects a filter,
    defaulting to the Inbox if the adapter is empty.
*   Reordered `clear()` before `switchToActiveTasks()` in `TagViewFragment`
    for proper filter list refresh.
*   Used `AndroidUtilities.tryUnregisterReceiver()` to safely unregister
    receivers in `TagViewFragment`, preventing potential crashes.
