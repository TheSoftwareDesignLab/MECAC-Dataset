refactor: Use dimen resources for date/time picker spacing

Replaces hardcoded layout and padding values with dimension resources for
better consistency and maintainability.

- Introduced `@dimen/quarter_keyline_first` (4dp).
- Adjusted vertical margins for date and time groups from 16dp to 8dp
  (`@dimen/half_keyline_first`).
- Adjusted vertical padding for shortcut buttons from 8dp to 4dp
  (`@dimen/quarter_keyline_first`).
- Removed explicit `android:textSize` from shortcut button style.
