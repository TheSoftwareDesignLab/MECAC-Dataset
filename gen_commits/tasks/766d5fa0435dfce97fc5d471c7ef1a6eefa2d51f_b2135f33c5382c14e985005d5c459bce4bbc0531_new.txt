feat: Add French translations for task recurrence

This commit introduces a set of new strings to support task repetition and recurrence options in French. It includes translations for concepts like "repeats on", "repeats after", "ends", and various monthly/weekly recurrence patterns.

Also includes a minor correction to the pluralization of "tâche(s)".
