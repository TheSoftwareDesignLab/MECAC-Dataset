refactor: Remove comments button and pass new task ID

The 'commentsButtonClick' method has been removed, indicating a change in how users initiate note editing for tasks.
Additionally, when a new task is created, its ID is now immediately stored in the parent activity's intent. This ensures the ID is accessible for subsequent actions without delay.
