refactor: Streamline widget task editing navigation

The widget's "Edit Task" action now consistently uses TaskStackBuilder to manage activity navigation.
This ensures the correct activity stack is built and the task list filter is properly passed,
allowing for seamless return to the original filtered list after editing a task.
This change replaces direct startActivity calls with conditional logic.
