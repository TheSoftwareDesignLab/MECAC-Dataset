feat: Implement configurable task widget

Introduce a new widget configuration activity (`WidgetConfigActivity`) that allows users to select a filter for displaying tasks directly on the widget.

Key changes include:
- New `WidgetConfigActivity` and its corresponding layout.
- Linking the widget provider to the configuration activity via `android:configure`.
- Storing widget-specific filter preferences (SQL query, title, new task values).
- Modifying `TasksWidget` to load and display tasks based on these configured filters.
- Refactoring widget update mechanisms to support per-widget configuration.
- Updating `FilterAdapter` to conditionally exclude intent-provided filters, which is necessary for the configuration screen.
- Redesigning widget layouts to prominently display the selected filter's title.
