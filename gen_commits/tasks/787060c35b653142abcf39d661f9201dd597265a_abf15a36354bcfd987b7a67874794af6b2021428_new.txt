refactor: Integrate task indenting into drag-and-drop gesture

The indent/unindent functionality has been refactored to be part of the task drag-and-drop gesture instead of a separate swipe. Horizontal movement during a drag now adjusts the task's indent level.

Key changes:
- Removed separate swipe actions and `indented` methods.
- `moved` methods now accept an `indent` parameter.
- `GoogleTaskDao` unifies indent/unindent logic within its `move` method.
- Introduced `minIndent` and `maxIndent` to control allowed indent range.
- `TaskContainer` updated with `targetIndent` for gesture tracking.
