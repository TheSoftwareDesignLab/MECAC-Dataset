refactor: Remove custom layout direction preference and logic

Removes the user preference for manually setting the app's layout direction (LTR/RTL).
The app will now always derive its layout direction automatically from the device or selected language locale, simplifying configuration and ensuring consistency.
The `Locale` class has been refactored to remove the `directionOverride` field and related methods like `withDirectionality` and `isRtl`.
Additionally, the unused `formatPercentage` method was removed from the `Locale` class.
