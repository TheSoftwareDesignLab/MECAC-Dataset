refactor: Streamline preference UI and remove redundant summaries

Removed various preference summaries and titles that were either obsolete, redundant, or inconsistent across the application. This includes:
- Removing meta-data based summaries for plugin preferences.
- Removing explicit summary settings for 'Sync & backup' and 'New task defaults' preference screens.
- Standardizing titles for 'Task defaults', 'Miscellaneous', 'Attachment directory', and 'Debug logging'.
This change simplifies the preference UI and cleans up associated string resources.
