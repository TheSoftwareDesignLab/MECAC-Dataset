feat: Add Dark Grey night theme with styled dialog buttons

Introduce a dedicated night theme for the Dark Grey color scheme (`values-night/theme_dark_grey.xml`).
This theme defines specific styles for various buttons and uses a new global `AlertButtonStyle` for dialog buttons.
The `AlertButtonStyle` was moved from `theme_white.xml` to `styles.xml` for centralized definition.
The base `DarkGrey` theme was refactored into `DarkGrey_Base` to improve extensibility.
