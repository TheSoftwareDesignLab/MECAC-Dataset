fix: Correct tag lookup in TaskEdit and refine list row height

Corrects tag retrieval in TaskEdit by using the Long ID directly from the map,
fixing an erroneous attempt to call `getId()` on a Long object.

Also, standardizes the height of the secondary text in `task_list_row.xml` to
`?android:attr/listPreferredItemHeight` for improved UI consistency.
