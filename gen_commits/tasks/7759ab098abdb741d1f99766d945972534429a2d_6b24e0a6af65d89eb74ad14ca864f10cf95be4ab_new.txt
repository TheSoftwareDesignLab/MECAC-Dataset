feat: Prompt login for offline users in updates view

When no activity is available and the user is not logged in, display a message encouraging login. The "no activity" container is now clickable to launch the ActFm login screen.

The 'REQUEST_ACTFM_LOGIN' constant in TagSettingsActivity was made public to support this. Also includes layout improvements for the 'no activity' view (e.g., centering, text size) and minor padding adjustments for widgets.
