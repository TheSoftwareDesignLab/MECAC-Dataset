feat: Allow displaying full task titles in scrollable widget

Adds a new preference for the scrollable widget to enable multiline display of task titles. Previously, titles were always truncated to a single line.

This change:
- Introduces `p_widget_show_full_task_title` preference.
- Updates widget layout to use `maxLines="1"` by default, then dynamically sets `setMaxLines` based on preference.
- Adjusts text bottom padding logic for better alignment with due dates when titles are multiline.
