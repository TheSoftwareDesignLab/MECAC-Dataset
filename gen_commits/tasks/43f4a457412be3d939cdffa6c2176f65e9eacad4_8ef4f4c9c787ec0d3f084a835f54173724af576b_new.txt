feat: Add keyguard support for scrollable widget

Configure the scrollable tasks widget to be available on the lock screen.
This involves updating the AndroidManifest to reference the scrollable
widget provider and setting the `widgetCategory` and `initialKeyguardLayout`
attributes in the provider info XML.
