feat: Implement compact mode for widget headers

Introduces a compact mode for task widget headers, automatically triggered
when the widget's available width falls below a defined threshold (275dp).

In compact mode:
- Date-based headers are simplified (e.g., "Today" instead of "Due: Today").
- Header text is limited to a single line with truncation and reduced
  horizontal padding for better fit in smaller widget sizes.
- The compact state is stored per widget instance and updated on resize.
