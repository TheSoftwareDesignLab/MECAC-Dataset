fix(fi): Correct 'yesterday' translation

The string `yesterday` was incorrectly translated as "Tomorrow" (`Huomenna`). It has been updated to "Yesterday" (`Eilen`).
Additionally, new Finnish string resources have been added for sorting groups (`sort_modified_group`, `sort_created_group`) and lowercase date words (`yesterday_lowercase`, `tomorrow_lowercase`, `today_lowercase`).
