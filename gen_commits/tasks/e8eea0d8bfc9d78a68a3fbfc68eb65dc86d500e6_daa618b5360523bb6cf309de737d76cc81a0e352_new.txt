refactor: Standardize widget item padding and layout

- Replaces hardcoded padding with `R.dimen.widget_padding` for consistency.
- Applies dynamic padding to task text and due date based on checkbox visibility.
- Simplifies `widget_row.xml` by flattening the layout structure and improving alignment.
- Removes unused `widgetPadding` field from `ScrollableViewsFactory`.
