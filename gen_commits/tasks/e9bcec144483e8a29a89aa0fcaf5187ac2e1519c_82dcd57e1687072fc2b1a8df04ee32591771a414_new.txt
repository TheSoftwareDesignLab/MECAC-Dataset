feat: Improve voice input setup and manage TTS resources

Voice input and voice reminders are now disabled by default.
Adds checks for voice input service availability in preferences, guiding
users to install it if missing on Android 2.1+, or informing them if
unsupported. Ensures Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine is properly shut down.
