refactor: Determine theme color darkness dynamically

The `ThemeColor.isDark` property is now calculated based on the contrast ratio of `colorPrimary` against white. This removes the need for the `dark_status_bar` attribute and its manual definition in theme styles, improving consistency and reducing reliance on static configuration.

The layout `control_set_repeat_display.xml` was updated to use `@color/text_primary` for consistency.
