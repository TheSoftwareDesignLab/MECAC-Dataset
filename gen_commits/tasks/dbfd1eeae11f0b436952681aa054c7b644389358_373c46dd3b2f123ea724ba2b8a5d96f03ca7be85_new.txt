feat: Add option to place widget due date inline or below title

This introduces a new preference for the scrollable widget to control the display position of task due dates. Users can now choose to have the due date appear below the task title (original behavior) or at the end of the same line as the task title.

*   Added `dueDateBelowTitle` preference to widget settings.
*   Updated `widget_row.xml` to include `widget_due_end` (inline) and `widget_due_bottom` (below title) TextViews.
*   Modified `ScrollableViewsFactory` to dynamically show the appropriate due date TextView based on the preference.
