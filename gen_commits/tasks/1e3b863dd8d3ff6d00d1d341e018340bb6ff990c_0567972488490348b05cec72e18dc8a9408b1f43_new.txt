fix(ta): Correct string placeholder formatting

The Tamil translation strings `repeats_plural_on_number_of_times`, `repeats_single_on_number_of_times`, and `import_summary_message` had an incorrect space before the '$' in some placeholders (e.g., `%4 $ s` changed to `%4$s`). This commit fixes these formatting issues.

Additionally, several `picker_mode_` related strings (e.g., `picker_mode_clock`, `picker_mode_text`, `picker_mode_calendar`, `picker_mode_date`, `picker_mode_time`) that are no longer in use have been removed from the `values-ta/strings.xml` file for cleanup.
