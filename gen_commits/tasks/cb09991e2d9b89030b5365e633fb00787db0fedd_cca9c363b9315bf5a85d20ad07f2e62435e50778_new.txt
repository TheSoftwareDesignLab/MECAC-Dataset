feat: Add widget frame drawables

Adds new `widget_frame.png` assets for both portrait and landscape orientations, likely for visual enhancements to app widgets.
Removes an obsolete `Log.i` debug statement and its import from `TaskDao.java`, cleaning up development-time logging.
Includes a minor whitespace fix in `widget_loading.xml`.
