feat: Display completed tasks in widget with done color

Fetch Task.ID and Task.COMPLETION_DATE to enable proper coloring.
Completed tasks in the widget list are now rendered with a specific 'done' color,
making their status more apparent. Overdue tasks are still colored,
but completed status takes precedence.
