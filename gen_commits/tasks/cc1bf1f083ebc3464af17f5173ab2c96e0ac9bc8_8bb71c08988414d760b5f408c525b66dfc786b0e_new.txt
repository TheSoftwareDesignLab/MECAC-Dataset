feat: Implement encryption service with Android KeyStore

Introduces an `Encryption` interface with two implementations:
- `KeyStoreEncryption`: Leverages Android KeyStore for secure key management and AES/GCM/NoPadding for cryptographic operations on Android Marshmallow (API 23) and above.
- `NoEncryption`: A passthrough implementation for devices running below Android Marshmallow, where KeyStore features are not available.

The appropriate encryption service is provided via dependency injection based on the Android API level.
