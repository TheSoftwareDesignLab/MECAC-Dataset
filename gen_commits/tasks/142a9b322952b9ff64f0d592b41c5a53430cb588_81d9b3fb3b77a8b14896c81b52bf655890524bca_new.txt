refactor: Revamp app theming and widget theme selection

Replaced the monolithic ActivityPreferences with dedicated Theme, ThemeManager,
and ThemeApplicator classes for better modularity and maintainability.

- Consolidated theme application logic into ThemedInjectingAppCompatActivity.
- Extended widget theming from a simple dark/light toggle to full theme selection.
- Renamed ColorPickerDialog to ThemePickerDialog.
- Updated all activities, fragments, and dialogs to utilize the new theming architecture.
