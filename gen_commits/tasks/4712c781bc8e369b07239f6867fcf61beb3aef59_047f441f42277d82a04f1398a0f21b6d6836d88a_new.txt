refactor: Remove explicit empty view text updates and DLG_loading string

The manual setting of empty view text (e.g., 'Loading...', 'No items') has been removed from TagViewFragment and GtasksListFragment. Additionally, the DLG_loading string resource and its translations are no longer needed and have been deleted. This change streamlines UI state management, likely deferring empty view content to the default ListView.setEmptyView behavior or a dedicated loading indicator.
