feat: Capitalize voice input and replace existing text

Previously, voice input would append to existing text in the input field.
This change updates the voice input assistant to always replace the entire
content of the text field with the recognized speech.

Additionally, the recognized speech is now formatted with the first letter
capitalized and the rest in lowercase, ensuring consistent presentation.
The unused `Editable` import has also been removed.
