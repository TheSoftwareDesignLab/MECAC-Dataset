feat: Enhance German localization for pricing and savings display

Updated German price strings to use a more conventional currency symbol placement
and wording (e.g., `%s $/Monat` instead of `$%s p.M.`). Introduced non-breaking
spaces for improved readability. Added a new string, `save_percent`, to enable
displaying percentage savings.
