feat: Request immediate CalDAV sync after OpenTasks sync

When an immediate OpenTasks sync is requested (e.g., manually by the user), also trigger an immediate, expedited sync for associated DAVx5 and Etesync accounts via `ContentResolver.requestSync`. This ensures changes from these providers are reflected promptly after an OpenTasks sync.
