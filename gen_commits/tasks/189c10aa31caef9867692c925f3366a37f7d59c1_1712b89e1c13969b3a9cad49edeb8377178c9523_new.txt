style: Add alternative custom tab indicator resources

Introduces new drawables for a custom tab indicator with '_alt' suffix, including a selector XML and corresponding 9-patch PNGs for various states (selected, focused, unselected).
These resources are assigned to the 'asEditTabBackground' style attribute in Theme.Astrid.Dark.
Also refines the condition for displaying the "Show Comments" menu item in TaskEditFragment, preventing it from showing redundantly when comments are already being edited.
