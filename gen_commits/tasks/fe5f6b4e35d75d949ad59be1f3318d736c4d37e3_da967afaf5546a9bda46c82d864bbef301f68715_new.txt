refactor: Migrate DragAndDropDiffer to Coroutines Flow

Replaces RxJava dependencies and implementations with Kotlin Coroutines Flow for handling asynchronous data streams in the `DragAndDropDiffer` and related adapter logic.

This change removes `RxAndroid`, `RxJava`, and `reactive-streams` dependencies, migrating `PublishSubject` and `CompositeDisposable` usages to `MutableSharedFlow` and `Flow` operators. This modernizes the asynchronous code and reduces the project's dependency footprint.
