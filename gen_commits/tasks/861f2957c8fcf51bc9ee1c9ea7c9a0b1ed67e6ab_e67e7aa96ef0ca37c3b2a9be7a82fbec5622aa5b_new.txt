feat: Use date/time picker without shortcut buttons

Introduces new layout files (`date_time_picker_no_shortcuts.xml`) for portrait and landscape orientations that omit the date shortcut buttons. The `DateAndTimePicker` class is updated to load these new layouts, as the `useShortcuts` flag is currently hardcoded to `false`.
