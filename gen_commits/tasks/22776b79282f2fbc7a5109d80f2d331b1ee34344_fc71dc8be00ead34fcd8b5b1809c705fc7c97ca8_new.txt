feat: Add legacy theme option for tasks widget

Introduces an "Old Style" theme choice for the tasks widget,
bringing back a classic look. This includes:
- New drawable resources for the widget header and body backgrounds.
- Custom color definitions for the legacy theme.
- Updated text color for tasks to ensure readability.
- A specific "add task" button icon and removal of the header separator.

Also fixes an issue where a separator was incorrectly added after the last task item.
