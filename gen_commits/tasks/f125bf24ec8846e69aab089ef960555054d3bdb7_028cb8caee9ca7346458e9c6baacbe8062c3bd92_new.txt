feat: Integrate ActionBarSherlock and migrate to Fragments

Integrates ActionBarSherlock to provide a consistent action bar experience
across all Android versions.

This required a significant refactoring:
- Convert main activities (TaskListActivity, FilterListActivity, TagViewActivity,
  etc.) to Android Support Library (v4) Fragments (ListFragment).
- Introduce new 'Wrapper' Activities to host these fragments.
- Update relevant XML layouts, manifest entries, and project configurations
  (including target SDK to API 14).
