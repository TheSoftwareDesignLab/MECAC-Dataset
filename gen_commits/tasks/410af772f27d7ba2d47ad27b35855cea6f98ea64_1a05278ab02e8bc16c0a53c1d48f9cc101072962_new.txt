feat: Add drag-and-drop reordering for custom filters

This commit introduces the ability to reorder custom filters in the filter settings screen using drag-and-drop.

Key changes:
- Adds `CustomFilterItemTouchHelper` to manage drag-and-drop interactions.
- Updates `CriterionViewHolder` to provide visual feedback (highlighting) when an item is being dragged.
- Modifies `CustomFilterAdapter` to pass context and handle list update callbacks for reordering.
- Integrates `ItemTouchHelper` in `FilterSettingsActivity` to enable the reordering feature.
- Introduces a new `Callback2` interface for two-argument callbacks.
- Includes minor layout adjustments in `custom_filter_row.xml`.
