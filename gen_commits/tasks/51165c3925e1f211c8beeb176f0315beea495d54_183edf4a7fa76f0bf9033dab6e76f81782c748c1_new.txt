refactor: Update Day theme identifiers and order

Renames the internal theme identifier `white-blue` to `white-red` across `keys.xml` and `ThemeService.java`.
Adjusts `ThemeService` logic to correctly map the `white-red` preference to `R.style.Theme_White`.
Reorders "Day - Blue" and "Day - Red" theme options in `EPr_themes` string arrays, prioritizing "Day - Blue" in the display list.
Removes an obsolete theme migration block from `UpgradeService`.
