refactor: Centralize AlertDialog and ProgressDialog theming

Introduce `org.tasks.dialogs.AlertDialogBuilder` to consistently apply themes to AlertDialogs, their contexts, and internal list views.
Migrate existing AlertDialog.Builder usages across the codebase to the new custom builder.
Adjust theme application for ProgressDialogs, NumberPickerDialogs, and NNumberPickerDialogs for consistent styling.
Refactor dialog building patterns in various control sets to directly return the constructed dialog.
