refactor: Apply subtask filter directly to Filter object

The `SubtasksHelper.applySubtasksToWidgetFilter` function now modifies
the `filter.filterOverride` property in place, rather than accepting
and returning a new query string. This simplifies the widget's
query generation by allowing the filter to be updated directly.
