feat: Improve gesture handling and notification scheduling

Refactored fling gesture detection to attach to ListView items via `setOnTouchListener`, using configurable distance and velocity thresholds for improved accuracy. Enhanced alarm scheduling to consider both tasks with explicit notifications and those with upcoming alerts from the `AlertController`.

- Replaced activity-level `onTouchEvent` with `ListView.setOnTouchListener` for gesture handling.
- Introduced `FLING_DIST_THRESHOLD` and `FLING_VEL_THRESHOLD`.
- `AlertController` now provides tasks with active alerts.
- `Notifications.scheduleAllAlarms` consolidates tasks from `TaskController` and `AlertController`.
- Removed `INTERNET` permission from `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- Updated version code and name.
