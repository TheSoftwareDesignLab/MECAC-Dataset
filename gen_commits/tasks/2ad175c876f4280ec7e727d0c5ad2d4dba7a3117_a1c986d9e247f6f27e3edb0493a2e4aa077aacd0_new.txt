feat: Add scrollable widgets for API 14+ and refactor widget logic

Introduces a scrollable widget implementation specifically for Android 4.0 (API 14) and above. The classic non-scrollable widget is now enabled only for older API versions.

This change also involved a significant refactoring of the existing widget architecture:
*   Extracted `WidgetUpdateService` and `WidgetConfigActivity` from the `TasksWidget` class into standalone files.
*   Introduced `WidgetHelper` to centralize common logic for widget management, including updating, configuration, and intent creation.
*   Updated all call sites to use the new `WidgetHelper` for widget-related operations.
*   Utilized API-level specific boolean resources (`is_pre_api_14`, `is_post_api_14`) to conditionally enable widget components in the manifest.
*   Added `org.tasks` to the dependency injection service's qualified packages.
