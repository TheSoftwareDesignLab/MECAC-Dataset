refactor: Decouple TaskAdapter from TaskListRecyclerAdapter

Introduced TaskAdapterDataSource interface to abstract data access methods
like getItem and itemCount. TaskAdapter now relies on this interface instead
of directly on TaskListRecyclerAdapter.

The `canMove` method signature in TaskAdapter and its implementations was
also updated to receive TaskContainer objects and positions directly,
removing the dependency on ViewHolder.
