feat: Add user status and initial PersonView header

Introduce a 'status' property to the User model to track friendship and relationship
states (e.g., pending, friends, blocked). This includes:
- Adding the STATUS column to the User table via database migration (v25).
- Enabling synchronization of the 'status' field from ActFm API responses.
- Creating a new header layout (task_list_body_user) for the PersonViewFragment
  to display user picture and name, preparing for status display.
