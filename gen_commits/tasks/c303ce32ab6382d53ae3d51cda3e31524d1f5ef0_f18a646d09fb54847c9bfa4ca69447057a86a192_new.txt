feat: Add TaskMover integration for list sorting

The `TaskMover` service is now injected into `TaskAdapter` and its derived classes.
A new `move` method was added to `TaskMover` to facilitate moving a single task to a specified list.
This enables the `SORT_LIST` action within `TaskAdapter` to utilize this new functionality.
