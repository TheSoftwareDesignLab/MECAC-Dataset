fix: Concatenate XML resources before importing with xml2po

The `xml2po` tool requires a single input XML file to process all string resources correctly. Previously, `xml2po` might have missed strings from fragmented resource XML files. This change ensures that all relevant Android XML files are first concatenated into a temporary file in `launchpad_pot_file_dir` before being passed to `xml2po` for translation import.
