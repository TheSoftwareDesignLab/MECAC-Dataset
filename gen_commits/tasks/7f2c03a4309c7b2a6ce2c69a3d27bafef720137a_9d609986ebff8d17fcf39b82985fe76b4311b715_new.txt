feat: Improve widget task editing and new task deletion

- Enable direct editing of tasks by clicking on them within scrollable widgets. The '+' button on widgets will continue to create new tasks.
- Fix: Ensure new tasks with empty titles are correctly deleted when leaving TaskEditActivity, mirroring existing behavior for TaskListActivity.
- Update application versionCode to 323.
- Adjust activity intent flags for improved widget navigation.
