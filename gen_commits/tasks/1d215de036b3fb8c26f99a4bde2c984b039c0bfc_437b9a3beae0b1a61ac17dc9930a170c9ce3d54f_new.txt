feat(filters): Allow long names to wrap and marquee

Moved padding and background definitions for filter rows from XML to `FilterAdapter.java` for centralized styling.
Configured the filter name TextView to display up to two lines and use an `ellipsize="marquee"` effect for names exceeding the available width.
Adjusted vertical padding of filter rows for better visual balance.
