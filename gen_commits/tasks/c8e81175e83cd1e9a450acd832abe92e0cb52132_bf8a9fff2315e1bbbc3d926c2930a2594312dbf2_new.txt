fix: Apply specific color to task edit selected text

The `themeColor` in `TaskEditControlSet` now directly uses `R.color.task_edit_selected` instead of resolving a theme attribute. This new color is applied to the "assigned to" display text in `EditPeopleControlSet`, ensuring a consistent visual style for selected elements within the task edit view.
