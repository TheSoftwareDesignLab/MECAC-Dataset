feat: Implement dark theme and refactor theming

Introduce a new dark theme, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes.

This change includes:
- Adding `p_use_dark_theme` preference.
- Refactoring theme application logic to dynamically apply `Tasks` or `Tasks.Dark` themes.
- Updating layouts to use theme attributes for colors, text colors, and drawables.
- Introducing `Tasks.Dark`, `TEA_Dialog_Dark`, and `TasksDialog` styles.
- Adding various dark theme specific assets (drawables, colors, selectors).
- Incrementing `versionCode` to 346.
