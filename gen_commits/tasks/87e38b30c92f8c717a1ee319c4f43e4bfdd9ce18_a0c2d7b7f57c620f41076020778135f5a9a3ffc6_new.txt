fix: Prevent pager interception during task reordering

The TaskListFragmentPager would sometimes intercept touch events while
a user was attempting to reorder tasks in the DraggableListView.

This change introduces a flag to temporarily disable the pager's touch
event interception when a drag operation is active. This ensures that
task reordering is smooth and not interrupted by accidental page swipes.
