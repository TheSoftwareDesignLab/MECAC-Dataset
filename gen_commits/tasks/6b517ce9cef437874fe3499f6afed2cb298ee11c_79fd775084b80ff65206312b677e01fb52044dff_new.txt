feat: Add web services tab and refactor task edit tabs

Introduces support for a dedicated Web Services tab in the task edit screen.
Refactors tab view determination logic by creating a `getTabForPosition`
method to map view pager positions to specific tab types (More, Updates,
Web Services).

Updates `getPageView` and `setPagerHeightForPosition` to use the new
centralized tab mapping, improving maintainability and extensibility.

Additional changes:
- Add a null check for layout parameters in `setViewHeightBasedOnChildren`.
- Set the background color of section dividers in `WebServicesView` to gray
  for better visibility.
- Add an early return condition in `TaskEditFragment#setCurrentTab` if
  `mIndicator` is not null.
