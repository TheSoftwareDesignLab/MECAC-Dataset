fix: Resolve widget background theming on Android 2.1

On Android 2.1 (API level 7), RemoteViews cannot programmatically set background colors or drawables. This commit refactors widget theming to use separate, pre-themed layout XML files for each widget theme, circumventing this platform limitation. New layouts like widget_initialized_dark.xml and widget_initialized_transparent.xml were added for this purpose.
