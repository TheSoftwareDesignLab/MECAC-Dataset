feat: Add Ukrainian language support and clean up string resources

Added comprehensive Ukrainian translations across the API and Astrid modules.
Performed an extensive cleanup, removing numerous unused and deprecated English string resources from various `strings.xml` files. This includes strings related to:
- Act.fm sharing and login.
- General dialogs and UI elements.
- Google Tasks specific messages.
- OpenCRX integration.
- Premium features and in-app billing.
- Intro popovers (entire `strings-intro.xml` removed).
- Backup and sync options.
A new script `bin/find-unused-strings.rb` was added to facilitate this cleanup.
