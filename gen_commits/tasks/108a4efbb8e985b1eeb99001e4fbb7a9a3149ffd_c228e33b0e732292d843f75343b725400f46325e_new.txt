refactor: Replace RemoveListener with SwipeListener for directional swipes

Transitioned TouchListView's gesture handling from a generic remove action
to distinct swipeLeft and swipeRight actions. The old RemoveListener
interface and 'remove_mode' attribute have been removed in favor of the new
SwipeListener and direct coordinate checks.
