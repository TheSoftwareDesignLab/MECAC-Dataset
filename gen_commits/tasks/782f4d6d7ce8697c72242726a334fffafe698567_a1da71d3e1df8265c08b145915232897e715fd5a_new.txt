fix: Convert snooze interval to milliseconds and use absolute time

The AlarmService.snooze method now expects an absolute timestamp. Updated
NotificationClearedReceiver to calculate this absolute time by adding the
snooze duration to the current time. The Preferences.swipeToSnoozeIntervalMS()
method now correctly converts the user-defined snooze interval (stored in
minutes) to milliseconds, ensuring accurate duration calculation.
