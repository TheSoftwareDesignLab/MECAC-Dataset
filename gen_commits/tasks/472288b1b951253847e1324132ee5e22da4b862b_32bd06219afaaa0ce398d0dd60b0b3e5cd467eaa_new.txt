fix: Ensure performance settings changes trigger UI refresh

Previously, changing certain performance-related settings in Labs (e.g., swipe gestures) would only show a warning dialog, requiring a manual restart for changes to take effect.

This commit refactors the preferences flow to:
- Propagate a "performance setting changed" event from LabsPreferences.
- EditPreferences now handles this event and passes it up.
- TaskListFragment listens for this result and automatically restarts the activity, ensuring that performance-related UI changes are applied immediately.
- Removes the old, non-enforcing warning dialog.
