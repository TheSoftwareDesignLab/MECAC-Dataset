feat: Add A/B tests for welcome/login flow

Introduces A/B tests to experiment with different welcome and login
experiences. The `ABTests.externalInit` method is called at startup to
conditionally define two new tests based on the presence of Google
accounts: `AB_NEW_LOGIN_NO_GOOGLE` and `AB_NEW_LOGIN_YES_GOOGLE`.

The `WelcomePagerAdapter` now dynamically selects the final welcome
page layout based on the chosen variant from these A/B tests, allowing
for different login UIs to be displayed.
