feat(ko): Add many new strings and refine existing translations

This commit introduces a large set of new Korean localized strings for various
new features and UI elements such as chip appearance settings, upgrade blurbs,
notification troubleshooting, and more.

Additionally, it refines the wording for:
- "no_application_found"
- "restart_required"
- "etesync_encryption_description"
