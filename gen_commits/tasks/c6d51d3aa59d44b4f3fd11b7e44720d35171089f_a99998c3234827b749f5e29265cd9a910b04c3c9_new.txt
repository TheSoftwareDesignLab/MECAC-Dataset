feat: Introduce AB test for drag-and-drop subtask sorting

Adds an AB test to control the default state of drag-and-drop subtask ordering.
New users are more likely to have drag-and-drop enabled by default, while existing users will primarily have it disabled.
Removes custom item sizing logic from the subtask list adapter, allowing standard layout behavior.
