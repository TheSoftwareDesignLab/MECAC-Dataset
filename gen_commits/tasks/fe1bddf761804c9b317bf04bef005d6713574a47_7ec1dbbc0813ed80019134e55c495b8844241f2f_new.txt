fix: Set task list row height to wrap content

The task list row layout (task_list_row.xml) previously set the root LinearLayout's
height to 'fill_parent'. This change ensures the row only takes up as much
vertical space as its content requires, preventing excessive spacing.

Updates the app version to 1.7.3 (versionCode 9).
