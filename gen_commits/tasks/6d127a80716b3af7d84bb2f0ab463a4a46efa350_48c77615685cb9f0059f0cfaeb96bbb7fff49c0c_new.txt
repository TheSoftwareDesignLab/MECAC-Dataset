feat: Add Gtasks list activity with swipe-to-indent

Introduces `GtasksListActivity` extending `DraggableTaskListActivity` to manage Gtasks-specific task lists.
This enables indenting and outdenting Gtasks tasks using left/right swipe gestures on the list view.
The `TouchListView` was refactored to replace `RemoveListener` with a `SwipeListener` supporting distinct left and right actions, making `DraggableTaskListActivity` more generic.
