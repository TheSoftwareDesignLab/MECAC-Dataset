feat: Split ActFm login and signup into separate UI flows

Redesigned the ActFm login/signup experience into distinct UI elements and flows.
- Replaced the single "Login with Username/Password" button with a "Sign up with email" button and a "Sign in" text link.
- Refactored dialog logic to use separate listeners and flows for signup and signin.
- Updated layout files, string resources, and removed unnecessary atomic variables.
