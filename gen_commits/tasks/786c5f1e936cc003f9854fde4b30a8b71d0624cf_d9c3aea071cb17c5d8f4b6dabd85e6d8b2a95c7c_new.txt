refactor: Streamline task row visibility and alignment

Removed redundant `setVisibility` helper method.
Updated `dueDateView` and `tagsView` to use direct `View.VISIBLE` or `View.GONE` calls based on content.
Added `android:gravity="center_vertical"` to the simple task row text container for consistent vertical alignment.
Adjusted adapter logic to prevent conflicting `CENTER_VERTICAL` rule application in simple layouts.
