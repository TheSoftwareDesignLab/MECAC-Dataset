refactor: Merge AstridTranslationTest into TranslationTests

Consolidates translation testing logic into a single `TranslationTests` class.

- Made `TranslationTests` concrete and removed abstract methods.
- Moved specific test logic and helper methods from `AstridTranslationTest` to `TranslationTests`.
- Eliminated redundant tests like `testDateFormats` and `testArraySizesMatch`.
- Removed `AstridTranslationTest` entirely.
- Dropped `DateTime` dependency for date formatting tests.
