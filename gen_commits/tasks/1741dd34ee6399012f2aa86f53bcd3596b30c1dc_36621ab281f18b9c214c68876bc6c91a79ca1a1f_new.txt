feat: Allow customizing task edit page layout with Beast Mode

Refactors "Beast Mode" from a simple toggle to a fully customizable task edit page.
Introduces a new preference screen where users can drag and drop to reorder elements within the Task Edit Activity.
Elements like Title, Who, When, Importance, Lists, Notes, Reminders, Timer Controls, and Share With Friends can now be repositioned.
The custom order is persisted across app sessions and can be reset to defaults. This provides users with greater control over their task creation and editing workflow.
