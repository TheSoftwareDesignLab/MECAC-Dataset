feat: Add task description display to scrollable widget

Introduces the ability to show task descriptions (notes) directly within the scrollable widget rows.
New preferences allow users to:
- Enable or disable the description display.
- Choose between a truncated (2 lines) or full description view.
The full description preference is dependent on the description display being enabled.
The widget layout and rendering logic have been updated to accommodate this new element and its preferences.
