refactor: Remove redundant task modification date updates

The `saveAndUpdateModifiedDate` method no longer explicitly updates
the `MODIFICATION_DATE` and `DETAILS_DATE` of the associated task.
This update is typically handled by the `TaskService` when metadata
is saved, making the explicit update here redundant. This change
simplifies the method signature and avoids unnecessary database writes.
