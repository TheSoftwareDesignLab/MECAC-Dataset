feat: Show "anyone" icon for unassigned tasks

Adds a default image (`icn_anyone.png`) for tasks explicitly assigned
to `Task.USER_ID_UNASSIGNED`.

This commit also refactors the task assignee picture display logic in
`TaskAdapter` to use `Task.USER_ID_SELF` and `Task.USER_ID_UNASSIGNED`
constants. A new `isTaskRabbit()` helper method was introduced to
`TaskRabbitTaskContainer` for clarity.
