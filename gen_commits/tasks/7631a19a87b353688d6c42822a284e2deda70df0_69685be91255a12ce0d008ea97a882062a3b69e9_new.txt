refactor: Streamline widget theme selection and application

Removes the dedicated WidgetTheme class and its management from ThemeCache.
Widget theme selection now reuses ThemePickerDialog, distinguishing widget themes from general app themes.
Widget background and text colors are determined directly based on the theme index.
