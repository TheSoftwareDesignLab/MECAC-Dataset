refactor: Abstract location fetching with LocationProvider

Introduce a LocationProvider interface and MapboxLocationProvider implementation.
This decouples LocationPickerActivity from direct Mapbox SDK calls
and enables using coroutines for fetching the current location.
Improves code structure and testability.
