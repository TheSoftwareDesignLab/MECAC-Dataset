fix: Prevent task reset when launching TaskList from widget

Remove FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED from the intent flags when launching TaskListActivity from the widget. This ensures that the existing task for TaskListActivity is not reset, preserving its state and back stack history when navigating from the widget.
