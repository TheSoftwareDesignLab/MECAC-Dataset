feat: Enhance 'Waiting On Me' section styling

Introduces new icons and themeable backgrounds for the 'Waiting On Me' (WOM)
section in the task edit activity.

- Add `tea_icn_waiting` icons for various densities.
- Introduce `asWomEditRowBackground` attribute and corresponding drawables
  (`wom_edit_background`, `wom_edit_background_white`).
- Update `task_edit_activity.xml` to use the new themeable background attribute
  and set the default visibility of the WOM row to `gone`.
- Dynamically set the WOM message text color and update the icon to the new
  `tea_icn_waiting` asset based on the current theme.
- Adjust `asEditBackground` in `Theme.White` slightly.
