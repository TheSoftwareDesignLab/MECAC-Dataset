refactor(sv): Improve string wording and typography

Updated various strings in the Swedish localization file.
Changes include:
- Replaced ASCII ellipsis '...' with the Unicode ellipsis '…'.
- Corrected punctuation by adding a missing period.
- Refined wording for action phrases like "done" and "snooze",
  and expanded the "themes" description for better clarity and accuracy.
