fix(hu): Refine existing and add new Hungarian translations

Enhanced clarity and conciseness for various strings (e.g., changing 'directory' to 'folder', 'program' to 'app').
Improved phrasing for messages related to app restart, sync permissions, notification bundling, and network errors.
Added new strings for the upgrade blurb and the 'Back' button.
