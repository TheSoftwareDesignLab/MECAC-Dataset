fix: Move task action processing and cursor closing to UI thread

The `ActionsLoaderThread` now schedules the entire task action loading loop, including cursor processing, task data extraction, and cursor closing, to be executed on the UI thread via `runOnUiThread`. Previously, these operations were performed on the background thread, with only `notifyDataSetChanged` being dispatched to the UI. This change may resolve threading synchronization issues related to cursor access or `taskActionLoader` updates.

Additionally, the import order for `AsyncImageView` was adjusted.
