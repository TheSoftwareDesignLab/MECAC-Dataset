feat: Implement help popover UI with arrow indicators

This commit introduces a new UI component for displaying contextual help or guide messages.
It includes the `help_popover.xml` layout and new `popover_arrow_up.png` and `popover_arrow_down.png` drawable assets.
The margins for the arrow indicators were also adjusted for optimal visual alignment.
