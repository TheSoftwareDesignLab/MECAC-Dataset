feat: Add task limit and 'View more' footer to widgets on Android 14+

Introduces a task limit for widgets on Android 14 (API 34, Baklava) and
above. Widgets will now display a maximum of 25 tasks plus an additional
'View more tasks' footer.

This change is implemented to address potential performance issues or
system limitations with RemoteViews on newer Android versions when
displaying a large number of items.

The new footer, when clicked, opens the full task list in the app,
allowing users to access all their tasks.
