refactor: Streamline widget theming and layouts

Removed `getThemedRemoteViews` and inlined its logic into `buildUpdate`.
Standardized widget header styling by defining text color and add button icon directly in XML layouts.
Updated header backgrounds, text colors, and add button icons for consistency across light and dark themes.
Removed unused color definitions and header separator image views from widget layouts.
Adjusted widget body color transparencies in `colors.xml`.
