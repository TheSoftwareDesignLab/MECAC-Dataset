feat: Introduce PowerWidget42 for 4x2 size

Adds a new Power Widget variant, `PowerWidget42`, specifically designed
for a 4x2 layout, displaying 5 tasks.

This change includes:
- A dedicated configuration activity (`ConfigurePowerWidget42Activity`).
- Its own AppWidgetProvider and UpdateService for managing widget lifecycle.
- Layout definitions (`widget_power_42.xml`) for the new widget size.
- Integration into `TaskListActivity` and `TaskDao` to ensure the new
  widget updates on task changes and sorting.
- Refactoring of the base `PowerWidget` to allow for easier extension
  and polymorphic updates for different widget sizes.
