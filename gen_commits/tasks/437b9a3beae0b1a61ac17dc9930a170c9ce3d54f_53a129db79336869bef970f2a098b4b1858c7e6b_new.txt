fix: Widget config theme and filter selection behavior

The WidgetConfigActivity now consistently applies the default theme.

Updated the FilterAdapter's setSelection method to always set the selected item,
rather than toggling off the selection when the same item is re-picked.

Also includes minor import reordering in FilterAdapter.
