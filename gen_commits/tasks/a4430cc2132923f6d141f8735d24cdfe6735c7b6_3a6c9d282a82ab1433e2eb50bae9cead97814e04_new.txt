refactor: Centralize chip styling and improve color defaults

Moved default chip text, icon, and stroke colors to ChipStyle using a new
@color/chip_text resource. Programmatic color application in ChipProvider now
only applies if a specific theme color is present, falling back to the style
defaults otherwise. This ensures consistent theming.
