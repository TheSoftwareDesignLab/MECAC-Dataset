fix: Improve comment input text color and filter long-press menu

Ensures comment input text is consistently black for better readability in `tag_updates_fragment.xml` and `task_edit_activity.xml`.
Implements a custom long-press dialog for filter list items in `FilterListFragment` when the layout is `LAYOUT_SINGLE`. This resolves an issue where standard context menus fail to appear reliably in certain UI configurations.
