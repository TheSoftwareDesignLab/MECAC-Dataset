refactor: Streamline task edit UI and layout structure

- Consolidate large-land layouts into general large layouts for task edit and list.
- Remove redundant `task_edit_activity.xml` for small-land screens.
- Extract save/discard buttons and their listeners from `TaskEditActivity`, centralizing UI control.
