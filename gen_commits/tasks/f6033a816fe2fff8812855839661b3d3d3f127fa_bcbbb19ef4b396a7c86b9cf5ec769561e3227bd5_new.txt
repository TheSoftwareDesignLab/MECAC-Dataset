feat(eu): Add new translations and refine existing strings

This commit introduces several new strings for the Basque localization (`eu`):
- Translations for Markdown feature description and title.
- Strings for various upgrade and subscription benefits, including automation, desktop access, customization, and free trial.
- Descriptions for different date and time picker modes.
- Translations for "Next [Day]" recurring options (e.g., Next Monday).

Additionally, it refines existing string descriptions:
- Clarifies the EteSync selection description.
- Simplifies the DecSync selection description.
