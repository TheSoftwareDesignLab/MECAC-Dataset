refactor: Replace filter selection UI with Jetpack Compose

The legacy FilterSelectionActivity and FilterAdapter have been removed. Filter selection
is now handled by a new Jetpack Compose-based FilterPicker DialogFragment and ViewModel.
A dedicated WidgetFilterSelectionActivity was introduced to host the Compose picker for widget configuration.
