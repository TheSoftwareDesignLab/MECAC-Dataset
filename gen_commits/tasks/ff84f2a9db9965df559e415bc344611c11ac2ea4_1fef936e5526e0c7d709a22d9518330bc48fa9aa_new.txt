refactor(it): Improve Italian string translations

Update terms for drawer customization and multiline titles for better clarity and consistency.
Specifically:
- Change "drawer" to "menù laterale".
- Change "linee" to "righe" for multiline titles.
- Clarify "multiline_title_on" and "multiline_title_off" descriptions.
