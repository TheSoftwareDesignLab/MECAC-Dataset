feat: Improve theme selection with preview and Pro integration

Introduced a dedicated ThemePickerDialog for choosing base themes, replacing the generic ColorPickerActivity.
The new dialog allows users to preview themes immediately upon selection.
Integrated Pro subscription checks, restricting certain themes to Pro users.
Refactored theme loading logic to support intent-based theme overrides and enforce Pro theme availability.
