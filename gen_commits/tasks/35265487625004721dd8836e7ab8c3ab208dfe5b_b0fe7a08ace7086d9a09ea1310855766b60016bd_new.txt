refactor: Centralize loading string and improve UI feedback

Renamed `ENA_loading` string resource to `DLG_loading` for a generic "Loading..." message, affecting multiple language files and `edit_note_activity.xml`.
Implemented explicit "Loading..." text for the empty view in `TagViewActivity` during initial list display and "No items" after data refresh if no tasks are present.
Added Javadoc and code comments for clarity in `TagViewActivity.java`.
Ensured consistent newline at end of `strings-opencrx.xml`.
