refactor: Abstract drag and drop enablement

Introduces an abstract `dragAndDropEnabled()` method in `TaskListRecyclerAdapter`.
This allows subclasses to define their drag and drop capabilities explicitly,
improving clarity and modularity in how drag and drop is enabled or disabled
for different task list types.
