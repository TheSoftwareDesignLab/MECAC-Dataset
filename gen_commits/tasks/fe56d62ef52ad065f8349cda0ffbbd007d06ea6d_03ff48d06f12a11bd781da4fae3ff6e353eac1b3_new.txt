feat(tr): Add and refine localization for location and backups

This commit introduces new Turkish string resources and updates existing ones to
improve clarity and support new features.

Key changes include:
- Renamed backup/export/import actions for better understanding (e.g., "Import tasks"
  to "Import backup", "Export tasks" to "Backup now").
- Updated "Copy to Google Drive" to "Google Drive backup".
- Added translations for background/foreground location permissions, crucial for
  location-based reminders.
- Introduced strings for automatic backups, including last backup status and
  Android's auto backup service integration.
- Included general UI strings such as "account", "device settings", and
  "no app found".
