refactor(fr): Improve UI terminology in French translations

Updates several French strings for better clarity and accuracy:
- Renames "Puce" to "Étiquette" for "chip" related strings (`chip_style`, `chips`, `chip_appearance`) to better reflect UI labels/tags.
- Changes "Cacher le bouton de vérification" to "Cacher le bouton d'achèvement" for `hide_check_button` to more accurately convey its completion purpose.
