feat: Improve widget checkbox styling with priority colors

Introduces dedicated color resources for widget priority checkboxes, ensuring a distinct visual appearance in widgets compared to the main application UI. Also defines explicit priority colors for night mode, improving readability and consistency in dark themes.
Refactors checkbox rendering logic in CheckBoxes.java to accommodate these distinctions and use shared drawable utilities.
