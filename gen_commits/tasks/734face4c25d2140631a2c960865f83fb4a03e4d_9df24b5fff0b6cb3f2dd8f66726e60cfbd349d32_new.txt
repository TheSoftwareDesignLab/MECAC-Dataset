refactor: Rewrite App Widget and abstract database operations

- The `AstridAppWidgetProvider` has been renamed to `TasksWidget` and moved
  to `com.todoroo.astrid.widget`. Its internal logic was completely
  rewritten to leverage `TaskService` and dependency injection for data.
- `AbstractDatabase` now provides direct wrapper methods for core
  `SQLiteDatabase` operations (insert, update, delete, rawQuery),
  improving abstraction and simplifying DAO interactions.
- `GenericDao` and `MetadataDao` were updated to use these new wrappers.
- Default task ordering logic was extracted into `TaskService.defaultTaskOrder()`.
- Minor UI cleanup includes removing 'Help' and 'Addons' menu items from
  task and filter lists.
- A new `reminder_popup.9.png` drawable was added.
- Fixed `isNewTask` logic in `TaskEditActivity` to handle null models.
- Disabled debug mode by default.
- Removed outdated `BasicDatabaseTests`.
