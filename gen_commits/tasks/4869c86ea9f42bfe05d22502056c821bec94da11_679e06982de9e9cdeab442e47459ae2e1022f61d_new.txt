fix: Handle nullable RemoteViews in widget factory

The `getViewAt` method now correctly handles cases where `buildUpdate(position)`
might return null by changing its return type to nullable and removing
the non-null assertion operator. This prevents potential `NullPointerException`s
and improves widget stability.
