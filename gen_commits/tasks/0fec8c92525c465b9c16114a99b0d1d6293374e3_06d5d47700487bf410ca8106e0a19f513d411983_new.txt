refactor: Adopt two-pane layout boolean for responsive UI

Replaces the `ActivityPreferences.isTabletSized()` method with a resource-based boolean `R.bool.two_pane_layout`. This allows for more flexible and clearer control over responsive UI behavior across different screen sizes, leveraging resource qualifiers like `values-w820dp`.
