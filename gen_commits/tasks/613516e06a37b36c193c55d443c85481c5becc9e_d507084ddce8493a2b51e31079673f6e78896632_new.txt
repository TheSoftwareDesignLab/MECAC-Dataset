fix: Enhance Producteev sync and tag management

Ensures Producteev metadata changes are correctly saved and the task modification date is updated.
Corrects Producteev label identification during sync by including dashboard context, preventing potential conflicts.
Optimizes tag synchronization logic to only save changes and update task modification date when tags have actually been modified.
Also includes build configuration updates: removes debuggable flag from manifest, updates target SDK to android-8, and streamlines launch configurations.
