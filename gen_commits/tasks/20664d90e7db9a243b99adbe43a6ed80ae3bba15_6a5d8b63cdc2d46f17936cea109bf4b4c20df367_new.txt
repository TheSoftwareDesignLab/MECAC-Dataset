feat(i18n): Add Hungarian strings for Markdown support

Adds new translatable strings for the Markdown feature, including a
description for enabling Markdown in titles and descriptions, and
the "Markdown" label itself. Also includes a minor fix for escaping
a special character in an existing string.
