refactor(db): Chunk DAO operations for large ID lists

Introduces chunking logic for database operations that take a list of IDs.
This change addresses potential SQLite "Too many SQL variables" errors
when querying or updating a large number of items in a single transaction.

The following methods in `TaskDao` now process ID lists in chunks:
- `fetch(ids: List<Long>)`
- `touch(ids: List<Long>)`
- `setParent(parent: Long, tasks: List<Long>)`

New utility functions `dbchunk`, `eachChunk`, and `chunkedMap` are
added to `DbUtilsKt` to facilitate this. Additionally, the `touch`
method now uses `currentTimeMillis()` for the `modified` timestamp
instead of SQL `strftime()`.
