refactor: Consolidate tablet layout into desktop layout

Removes the explicit `AppLayout.tablet` enum and all related logic.
Devices previously classified as tablet will now be treated as desktop,
simplifying layout management and providing a more consistent experience.

Changes include:
- Removal of `AppLayout.tablet` enum, `isTablet` getter/function.
- Update `calculateLayout` to only differentiate between mobile and desktop.
- Removal of tablet layout selection from device settings.
