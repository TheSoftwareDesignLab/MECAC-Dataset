refactor: Add ScrollControllers to client and vendor full-width views

Initialize and dispose multiple ScrollController instances for the ListView widgets in ClientViewFullwidth and VendorViewFullwidth. This allows for programmatic control over scrolling and ensures proper resource management.

TickerProviderStateMixin was added as a prerequisite for ScrollController usage, potentially enabling future complex scroll interactions.
