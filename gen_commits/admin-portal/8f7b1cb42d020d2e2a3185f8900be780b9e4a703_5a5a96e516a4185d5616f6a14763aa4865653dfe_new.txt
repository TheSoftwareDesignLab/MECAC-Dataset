refactor: Update menu and dialog typography and focus

Standardize text styles from `headline6` to `subtitle1` for company names, action labels ('Add Company', 'Logout'), and the About dialog title.
Improve keyboard navigation by wrapping `IconButton` with `FocusTraversalGroup(descendantsAreTraversable: false)`.
