refactor(presenters): Change getField return type to Widget

The getField method in all EntityPresenters now returns a Widget instead of a String. This enables direct rendering of UI elements in data tables and other display components, improving flexibility.

Other changes include:
*   InvoiceModel: Added logic to clear invitation links when an invoice is cleared.
*   AuthRepository: Simplified initial data fetching by using 'first_load=true' instead of extensive explicit includes.
