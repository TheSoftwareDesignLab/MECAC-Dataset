feat: Adapt editor layout based on preview enablement

The editor's full screen state and the visibility of its layout toggle
button are now conditional on the `isPreviewEnabled` preference.

When `isPreviewEnabled` is false on desktop:
- The editor will automatically display in full screen mode.
- The toggle button to switch between sidebar and full screen editor will be hidden.

This change ensures a more streamlined and consistent user experience when the
preview pane is not enabled or available.
