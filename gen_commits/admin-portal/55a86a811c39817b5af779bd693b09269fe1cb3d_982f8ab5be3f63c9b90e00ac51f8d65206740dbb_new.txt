refactor: Remove nested GatewayEntity from CompanyGateway

The GatewayEntity object is no longer directly embedded within the CompanyGatewayEntity model. Instead, relevant gateway properties are now accessed via a lookup in the static state's gatewayMap using the company gateway's gatewayId. This reduces data duplication and simplifies the model structure.

Specifically:
- The 'gateway' property has been removed from CompanyGatewayEntity.
- Display names (e.g., in lists, views) now use 'companyGateway.label' instead of 'companyGateway.gateway.name'.
- Gateway type IDs and token billing support are retrieved by looking up the GatewayEntity from 'state.staticState.gatewayMap[companyGateway.gatewayId]' when needed.
- API requests for company gateways no longer include '?include=gateway'.
