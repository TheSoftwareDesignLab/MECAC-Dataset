feat: Add Quote, Project, Task, Vendor, Expense screens

- Integrated new entity screens and navigation routes for Quote, Project, Task, Vendor, and Expense.
- Corrected selection logic in ExpenseListItem to use expense.id instead of client.id.
- Refactored InvoiceEdit to receive GlobalKey<FormState> as a parameter, centralizing form state management in the respective screen wrappers (e.g., InvoiceEditScreen, QuoteEditScreen) for improved reusability.
