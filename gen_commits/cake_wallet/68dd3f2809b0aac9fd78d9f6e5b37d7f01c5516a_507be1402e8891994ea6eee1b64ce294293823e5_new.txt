refactor: Centralize EVM chain priority fee calculations

Introduced an abstract `getTotalPriorityFee` method for chain-specific priority fee logic.
Implemented `getTotalPriorityFee` for Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, and Polygon, moving Polygon's unique fee logic.
Adjusted `sendAll` gas buffer calculation for Base chain transactions.
Increased transaction fee display precision in `EVMChainTransactionInfo`.
