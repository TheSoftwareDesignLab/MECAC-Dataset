feat: Implement EVM chain scam token detection

Allows Erc20Token.iconPath and isPotentialScam to be mutable for dynamic updates.
Introduced abstract getDefaultTokenContractAddresses for EVM wallets to list whitelisted tokens.
Added _checkForExistingScamTokens to identify tokens with symbols conflicting with native currencies and not present in the whitelist, marking them as potential scams and clearing their icons.
Improved send_page.dart with context.mounted checks for robust navigation.
