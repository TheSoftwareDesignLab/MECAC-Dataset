feat: Add Wallets setting and refine UI card borders

Introduces a new 'Wallets' entry in the settings menu (both global and desktop-specific)
allowing users to navigate to the wallet list.
Refactors `DashBoardRoundedCardWidget` to use `OutlinedButton` instead of `TextButton`
to manage card borders more effectively, removing the border from `BoxDecoration`.
Increases the border width of `BalanceRowWidget` from 1 to 1.5 for better visual emphasis.
