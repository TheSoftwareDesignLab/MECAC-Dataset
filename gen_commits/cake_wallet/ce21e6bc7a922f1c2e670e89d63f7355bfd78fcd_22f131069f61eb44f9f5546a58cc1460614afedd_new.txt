feat: Implement app-wide dark and light themes using ThemeData

This commit introduces comprehensive theming support across the application.

Key changes include:
*   **Theme Integration**: Migrated all UI components from direct `Palette` and `PaletteDark` color references to Flutter's `ThemeData` properties, enabling dynamic theme switching.
*   **Palette Refinement**: Reworked `Palette` and `PaletteDark` with more semantic color names for improved organization and clarity.
*   **Asset Management**: Added dedicated image assets for the light theme, ensuring visual consistency across themes.
*   **BasePage Enhancements**: Updated `BasePage` to dynamically manage background colors and button assets based on the active theme.
*   **Screen Specific Styling**: Refactored `DashboardPage` and `ReceivePage` to utilize `Scaffold` with theme-adaptive linear gradients, and updated other screens to correctly apply themed colors.
*   **Theme Definition**: Extended `themes.dart` with detailed `ThemeData` configurations for both light and dark themes, mapping all necessary colors and text styles.
*   **Code Cleanup**: Removed obsolete color definitions and unused UI widgets (`CopyButton`, `PresentPicker`, `StandartCloseButton`).

This refactoring significantly improves the application's visual flexibility and maintainability.
