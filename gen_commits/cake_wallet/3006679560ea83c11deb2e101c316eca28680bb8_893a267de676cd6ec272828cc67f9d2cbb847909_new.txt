feat: Integrate Trocador AnonPay functionality

This commit introduces full support for Trocador AnonPay, enabling users to generate privacy-focused invoices and donation links within the application.

Key features include:
- Creation of crypto invoices and donation links with optional details (name, description, email, amount).
- Support for various cryptocurrencies and fiat currency equivalents for invoices.
- Tracking of AnonPay invoice statuses.
- Generation of both clearnet and onion service links for privacy.
- Integration into the receive flow, offering AnonPay as an option alongside regular addresses.
- Display of AnonPay transactions in the dashboard's transaction list.

Architectural changes:
- Introduced a `Currency` abstract interface, implemented by `CryptoCurrency` and `FiatCurrency`.
- Added new models (`AnonpayInvoiceInfo`, `AnonpayDonationLinkInfo`, `AnonPayRequest`, `AnonpayStatusResponse`), API client, stores (`AnonpayTransactionsStore`), and view models (`AnonInvoicePageViewModel`, `AnonpayDetailsViewModel`, `ReceiveOptionViewModel`).
- Implemented dedicated UI pages for AnonPay invoice creation, receive, and details.
- Added `anonPayReferralCode` secret and corresponding environment variable.
- Updated core components like `WalletAddressListViewModel`, `DashboardViewModel`, and transaction filtering to accommodate AnonPay items.
- Introduced new internationalization strings for AnonPay-related UI elements.
- Stored AnonPay donation links in shared preferences for persistence.
