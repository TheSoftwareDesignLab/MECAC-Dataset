refactor: Simplify theme-dependent UI logic

Removed `itemFromTheme` utility and replaced its usage with direct conditional theme checks using new `isLightTheme`, `isBrightTheme`, and `isDarkTheme` getters on the `Themes` enum.

This refactors theme-specific asset and color selection logic across `BasePage`, `main.dart`, various wallet-related screens, and alert dialogs. `ThemeData` text style properties were also refactored to store specific UI colors for alerts and buttons.

Updated `transfer.png` and `upload.png` assets with 2.0x and 3.0x versions for improved display resolution.
