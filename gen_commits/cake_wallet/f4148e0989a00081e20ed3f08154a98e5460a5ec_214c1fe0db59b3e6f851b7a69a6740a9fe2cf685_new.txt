feat: Enhance fiat API settings with Tor-only mode

Replaces the boolean `shouldDisableFiat` with a `FiatApiMode` enum (Enabled, Tor Only, Disabled).
Introduces a 'Tor only' option for fiat API requests to provide users with more granular privacy control.
Includes migration for existing users, updates backup/restore, privacy settings UI, and relevant view models.
