feat: Add macOS desktop support and responsive UI

Introduces comprehensive macOS desktop support, including native integration
for the `cw_monero` plugin and all wallet functionalities. The UI has been
refactored to be fully responsive, with dedicated desktop-specific components
like a new dashboard layout, sidebar navigation, and wallet selection dropdown.

Key changes include:
- Implemented macOS build and runtime environment, including Xcode project
  configuration, CocoaPods, and native Swift/C++ code for Monero.
- Developed `ResponsiveLayoutUtil` and applied it across the application for
  adaptive UI on desktop screens.
- Added desktop-specific UI elements such as `DesktopDashboardPage`,
  `DesktopSidebarWrapper`, `DesktopWalletSelectionDropDown`, and
  reusable action/setting buttons.
- Replaced custom platform wake lock implementations with the cross-platform
  `wakelock` package.
- Integrated new OnRamper and Payfura buy providers, with desktop-specific
  API key handling for ChangeNow and SimpleSwap exchanges.
- Refactored core modules like `WalletKeysViewModel` and `NodeListViewModel`
  to improve architecture and reactiveness to wallet changes.
- Abstracted main dashboard actions and settings into structured classes
  for better maintainability and UI presentation.
- Enhanced form fields for better keyboard navigation on desktop.
- Conditional loading of features (e.g., `initUniLinks`) based on platform.
