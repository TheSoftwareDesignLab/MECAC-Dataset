fix(fr): Standardize "wallet" to "portefeuille" and refine translations

Updates the French localization file (strings_fr.arb) to consistently use
"portefeuille" instead of "wallet". Also includes minor corrections for
"Reset" to "Réinitialiser", "All" to "TOUT", and other phrasing improvements
for enhanced clarity and accuracy in various parts of the application.
