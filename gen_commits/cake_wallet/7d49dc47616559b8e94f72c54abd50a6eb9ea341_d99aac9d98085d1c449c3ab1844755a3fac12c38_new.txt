feat: Replace Ionia purchase confirmation with generic send alert

The dedicated Ionia gift card purchase confirmation modal has been removed.
It is now replaced by the `ConfirmSendingAlert` used for regular cryptocurrency sends,
leveraging the `SendViewModel`. This change unifies the confirmation experience
and allows for more detailed transaction information. `ConfirmSendingAlert`
and `BaseAlertDialog` were updated to support payment ID display and custom button styling.
