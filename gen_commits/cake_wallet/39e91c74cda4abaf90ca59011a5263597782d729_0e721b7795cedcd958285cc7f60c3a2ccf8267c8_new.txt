refactor: Auto-determine picker scrollbar visibility

Removed `isAlwaysShowScrollThumb` property from `Picker` and related components. The scrollbar thumb visibility is now dynamically calculated within the `Picker` widget based on the number of items. This simplifies component interfaces and centralizes scrollbar display logic.
