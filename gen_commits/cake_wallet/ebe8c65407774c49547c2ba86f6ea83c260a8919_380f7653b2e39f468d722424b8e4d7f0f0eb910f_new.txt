feat: Allow MWEB/non-MWEB UTXO selection for Litecoin transactions

Introduce `UnspentCoinType` to filter unspent transaction outputs.
Enable users to select MWEB or non-MWEB funds when creating transactions.
Add "Peg-in" and "Peg-out" buttons on the Litecoin balance page for easier fund management.
Update `ElectrumWallet`, `SendViewModel`, and UI components (Send, Unspent Coins List) to support this functionality.
Includes minor fixes for Litecoin sync and dependency updates.
