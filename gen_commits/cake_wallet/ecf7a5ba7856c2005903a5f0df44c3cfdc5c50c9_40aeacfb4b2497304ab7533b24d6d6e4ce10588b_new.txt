feat: Revamp alert dialogs, pickers, and exchange confirm page UI

Introduces a consistent design for alert dialogs and pickers across the app.
Refactored `CurrencyPicker` and generic `Picker` to use new custom alert components (`AlertBackground`, `AlertCloseButton`).
Redesigned the `ExchangeConfirmPage` for improved clarity and interaction, including new `question_mark` assets.
Added new colors (`alizarinRed`, `deepVioletBlue`) to `palette.dart` and extensively updated `themes.dart` to support the new UI.
Applied consistent typography (Poppins font) to various UI texts.
Implemented input length limiting for the exchange amount field.
