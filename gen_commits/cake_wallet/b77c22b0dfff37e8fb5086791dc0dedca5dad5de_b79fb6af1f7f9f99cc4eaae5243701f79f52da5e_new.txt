refactor: Centralize system theme handling in RootState

Moved `didChangePlatformBrightness` logic from `AppState` to `RootState` to consolidate app lifecycle observation. Added a delay for iOS when applying system theme changes to prevent potential issues.
Updated API for `platformBrightness` from `window` to `platformDispatcher`.
