refactor: Consolidate alert dialogs and improve node UI

Replaced multiple custom alert dialogs with generic `AlertWithOneAction` and `AlertWithTwoActions` for consistency.
Overhauled Node List and New Node pages with dark theme adjustments, improved styles, and updated navigation.
Added `add_new_node` translation and implemented a disabled state for new node save button.
