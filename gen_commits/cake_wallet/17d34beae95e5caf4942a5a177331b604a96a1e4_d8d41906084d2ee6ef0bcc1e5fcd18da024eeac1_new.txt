fix: Improve error handling and corrupted wallet recovery

- Await all ExceptionHandler calls for proper error processing and UI context.
- Implement dedicated popup for corrupted wallets to display recovered seeds.
- Make BaseAlertDialog content scrollable to accommodate long error messages.
- Consistently track the `_lastOpenedWallet` across wallet lifecycle events.
- Update `monero_c` dependency to the latest version.
- Remove unused `sp_scanner` and `cw_mweb` plugins.
- Refactor backup service logic for transaction descriptions.
