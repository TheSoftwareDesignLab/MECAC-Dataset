feat: Make exchange best rate observable and improve updates

The `bestRate` property in `ExchangeViewModel` is now `@observable`, allowing dependent UI elements to react to its changes. Amounts are now automatically recalculated when `bestRate` changes.

Best rate calculation is now triggered immediately on user input in deposit/receive fields, improving responsiveness. Error handling for Trocador API has been enhanced, and `printV` is used for verbose logging in exchange providers.
