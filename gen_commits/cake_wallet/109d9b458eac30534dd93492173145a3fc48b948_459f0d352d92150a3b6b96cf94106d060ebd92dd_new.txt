feat: Revamp contact list UI and add sorting and filtering

This commit introduces significant improvements to the contact list functionality and user interface:

- **UI Redesign**: The contact list page now features a tabbed interface, separating "Wallets" from "Contacts" for better organization.
- **Contact Sorting & Filtering**: Users can now sort their contacts by:
    - Creation Date (requires a new `lastChange` field in the `Contact` entity)
    - Alphabetical order
    - Group by type
    - Custom reordering via drag-and-drop.
- **Filter Action Button**: A new floating action button provides quick access to sorting and filtering options for the contact list.
- **Refactoring**: The `WalletListOrderType` enum has been renamed to `FilterListOrderType` to be more generic and reusable across different lists (wallets, contacts).
- **Preference Keys**: Added `contactListOrder` and `contactListAscending` preference keys to `SettingsStore` to persist user sorting choices.
- **Duplicate Contact Name Validation**: Implemented a check to prevent adding contacts with existing names, improving data integrity.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed the unused `CollapsibleSectionList` widget.
