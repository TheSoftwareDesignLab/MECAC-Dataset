fix: Correct exchange address input enablement

Restore conditional logic for enabling/disabling deposit and receive address
inputs in the exchange store, which were previously hardcoded to true.

Also, refactor subaddress display on the receive page:
- Removed manual string shortening logic for subaddresses.
- Implemented `Text` widget's `maxLines` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`
  to handle visual truncation of subaddresses when `isShortAddressShow` is enabled.
