feat: Enhance seed phrase input validation and UX

Refactors the seed widget to provide direct and immediate feedback during seed phrase entry.

- **SeedWidget:**
  - Now validates individual words or multiple pasted words dynamically.
  - Displays an 'incorrect_seed' error message directly within the input field for invalid current entries.
  - Utilizes the new `onDisabledPressed` callback for the 'Add new word' button to show validation errors when attempting to add invalid words.
  - The 'Restore Next' button's enabled state now depends on the validity of all entered seed words.
- **PrimaryButton:**
  - Added `onDisabledPressed` callback to allow actions when the button is disabled (e.g., showing a validation error).
  - Changed disabled button color to transparent for better consistency.
- **RestoreFromSeedForm:**
  - Removed outdated MobX reaction-based error handling, as SeedWidget now manages its own validation state.
- **i18n:**
  - Added 'incorrect_seed' localization string across all supported languages for improved error clarity.
