fix: Handle wallet loading errors with fallback mechanism

Introduces a try-catch block in the wallet loading service.
If the initially requested wallet fails to load (e.g., due to corruption),
the service now attempts to open another available wallet. This prevents
the app from becoming completely inaccessible and improves overall
resilience, ensuring the user can still access the app with a functional
wallet if one is available. If all wallets are corrupted, the original
error is re-thrown.
