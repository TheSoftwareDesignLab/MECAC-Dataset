feat(address): Integrate Yat via dedicated AddressResolver service

Introduces YatService for fetching Yat emoji addresses and AddressResolver
class to centralize domain parsing for Yat, Unstoppable Domains, and OpenAlias.
Removes outdated Yat-specific UI components and screens, streamlining the
address resolution flow with dependency injection. Adds emoji string extension
and ParsedAddress factory constructors for improved handling.
