feat: Improve wallet restore seed validation for different types

Enhances the seed phrase validation logic to be type-specific for wallet restoration.
Bitcoin and Litecoin wallets now support both 12 and 24-word Electrum seed phrases,
while Monero wallets continue to require a 25-word seed. The restore button
enablement logic has also been adjusted to bypass height validation for wallet
types that do not utilize a blockchain height selector.
