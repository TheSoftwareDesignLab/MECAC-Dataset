refactor: Extract dashboard header with action buttons and filters

Moved the `ButtonHeader` from `trade_history_panel.dart` to its own dedicated file `button_header.dart`. This header includes Send, Exchange, and Buy action buttons, as well as a comprehensive filter for transaction and trade history.

Updated relevant history list item heights (`DateSectionRaw`, `TradeRow`, `TransactionRow`) and border widths to ensure consistent layout. Adjusted `AnimatedContainer` duration in `TradeHistoryPanel`.
