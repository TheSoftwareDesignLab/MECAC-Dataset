feat: Display and use resolved addresses for domain inputs

Introduces `extractedAddress` to store the final resolved address after domain/alias parsing.
The UI now shows this extracted address for clarity in send and confirmation screens.
Transaction outputs in Bitcoin and Monero wallets now correctly use the `extractedAddress` for sending.
