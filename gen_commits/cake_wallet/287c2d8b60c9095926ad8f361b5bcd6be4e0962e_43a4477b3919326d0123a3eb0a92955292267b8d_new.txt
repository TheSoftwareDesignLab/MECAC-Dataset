feat: Centralize BasePage route callbacks and unfocus keyboard

Refactor BasePage to integrate RouteAwareWidget, exposing route lifecycle callbacks
like push and pop. These callbacks now receive a BuildContext.

This enables pages to define actions upon navigation, such as automatically
dismissing the keyboard when navigating away from input fields. Implemented
keyboard unfocus for Exchange, New Wallet, Restore, and Send pages.
