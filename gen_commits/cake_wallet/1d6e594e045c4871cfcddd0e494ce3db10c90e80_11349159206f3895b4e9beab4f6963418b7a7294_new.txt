feat: Implement automatic exchange trade monitoring

Introduced `TradeMonitor` to periodically fetch and update the status of active exchange trades using their respective providers.
- Monitoring is automatically paused when the app is in the background and resumed in the foreground.
- Added a new privacy setting to enable/disable automatic exchange status updates.
- Enhanced the trade list UI with a visual status indicator on each trade row.
