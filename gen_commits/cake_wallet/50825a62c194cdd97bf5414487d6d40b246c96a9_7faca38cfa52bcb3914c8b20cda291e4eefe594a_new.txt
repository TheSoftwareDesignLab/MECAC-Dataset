feat: Improve Litecoin MWEB sync, Electrum client, and transaction handling

Refactors Litecoin MWEB synchronization with a dedicated `mwebSyncStatus` for more robust state management. Enhances Electrum client connection handling, error logging, and socket cleanup. Updates `getChangeAddress` logic for MWEB peg-ins and coin control, and improves `PendingBitcoinTransaction` with UTXO details and change address overrides. Also includes UI refinements for Litecoin balances and various minor fixes across the codebase.
