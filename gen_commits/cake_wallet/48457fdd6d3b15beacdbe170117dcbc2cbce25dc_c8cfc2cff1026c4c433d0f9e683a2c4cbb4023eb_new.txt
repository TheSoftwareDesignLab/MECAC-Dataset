feat(cakepay): Add country selection and filtering for cards

Introduce a new `Country` entity to standardize country data, including ISO codes and full names, along with flag assets.
Implement fetching available countries from the CakePay API as `Country` objects.
Add a country picker to the CakePay cards list page, allowing users to filter available vendors.
Persist the user's selected country preference in `SettingsStore`.
Update `CakePayCardsListViewModel` to utilize the new `Country` entity and `SettingsStore` for country management.
