refactor: Improve BaseAlertDialog action button layout

Consolidates the height management for the action button row into a single
parent Container. This change also simplifies the structure of individual
button containers by removing redundant ButtonTheme widgets and explicit
padding. Unused styling FIX-ME comments have also been removed.
