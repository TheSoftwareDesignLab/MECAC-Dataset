feat: Redesign welcome and wallet setup flow

Introduces a new multi-step welcome experience for initial setup.
- Added `CreatePinWelcomePage` to prompt users to set a PIN before wallet options.
- Refactored `WelcomePage` to serve as a dedicated hub for creating or restoring wallets.
- Centralized PIN setup logic, removing it from individual restore flows.
- Updated routing and added new translation strings to support the new flow.
