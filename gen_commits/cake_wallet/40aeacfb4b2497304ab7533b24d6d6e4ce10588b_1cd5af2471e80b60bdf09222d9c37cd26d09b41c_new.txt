refactor: Unify exchange page structure and theme integration

Extract common page scaffold and navigation into `BaseExchangeWidget`.
Integrate `Theme.of(context)` for consistent styling of colors, gradients, and text across exchange UI components.
Add new theme text styles and palette colors to support dynamic theming.
Remove direct `Palette` usage in favor of theme-based colors.
