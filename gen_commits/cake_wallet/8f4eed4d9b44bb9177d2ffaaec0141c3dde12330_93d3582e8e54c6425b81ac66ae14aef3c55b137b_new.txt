chore: Improve Spanish localization for clarity and branding

- Corrected pluralization of "wallet group" (`grupo de billetera` to `grupo de billeteras`).
- Replaced "billetera de pastel" with "Cake Wallet" for proper branding.
- Addressed various grammatical errors, phrasing, and capitalization inconsistencies.
