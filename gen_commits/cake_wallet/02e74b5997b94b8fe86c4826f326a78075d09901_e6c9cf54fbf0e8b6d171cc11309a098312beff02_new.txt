feat: Enhance background sync with notifications and granular controls

- Implemented transaction notifications for newly received/sent transactions during background sync.
- Added advanced background sync conditions: require unmetered network, battery not low, device charging, and device idle.
- Integrated `flutter_local_notifications` and necessary Android permissions (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC`).
- Upgraded Android Gradle plugin to 8.7.1 and enabled Java 17 desugaring.
- Introduced new dev pages for inspecting shared preferences and background sync logs.
