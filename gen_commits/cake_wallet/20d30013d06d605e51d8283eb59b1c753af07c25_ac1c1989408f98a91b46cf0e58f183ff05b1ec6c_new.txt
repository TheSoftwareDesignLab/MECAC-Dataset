fix: Refine Node URI handling and prevent unmounted context issues

Refactor `Node.path` to be non-nullable, defaulting to an empty string, and simplify its usage in URI construction.
Enhance URI generation logic for non-Electrum wallet types (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) by directly building the URI string, ensuring proper HTTP/HTTPS prefixing and path formatting for improved robustness.
Add `context.mounted` check before `Navigator.pop` in seed verification to prevent navigation errors on unmounted widgets.
