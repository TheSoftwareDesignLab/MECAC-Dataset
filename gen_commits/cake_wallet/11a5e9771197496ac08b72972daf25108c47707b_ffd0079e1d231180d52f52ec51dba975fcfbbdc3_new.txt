refactor: Use uninitialized state for initial authentication

Updates the application's initial authentication state handling. The bootstrap process no longer explicitly sets 'denied' if no wallet is found, relying on 'uninitialized' state instead. This state is then used to determine the initial route for new users.
Adds null-safe assertions for navigator state in route changes.
