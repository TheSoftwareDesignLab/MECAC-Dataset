feat: Add 'Introducing Cake Pay' card to dashboard

Introduce an onboarding card on the dashboard to highlight Cake Pay.
The card is displayed for the first wallet of a given type (excluding Haven).
Users can dismiss the card, and its state is persisted in `WalletInfo`.
This includes a new `IntroducingCard` widget and localization for the card's text.
