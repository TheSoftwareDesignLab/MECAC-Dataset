feat: Implement background trade monitoring and status display

Introduces a `TradeMonitor` service to periodically fetch and update the status of active exchange trades. This service leverages timers to poll various exchange providers and saves updated trade states to the database.

The `DashboardViewModel` now utilizes the `TradeMonitor` to keep track of ongoing swaps. Additionally, `TradeRow` widgets on the dashboard have been enhanced with a visual colored indicator to quickly convey a trade's current state (e.g., completed, failed, pending).
