fix(ui): Fade long transaction titles in dashboard

Wrap the transaction title and its associated tags within an `Expanded` widget.
The title `Text` widget is now wrapped in `Flexible` and configured with `TextOverflow.fade`.
This ensures that long transaction titles gracefully truncate and fade out instead of causing layout overflow or being abruptly cut off.
