refactor: Simplify Fiat API setting to a toggle switch

The Fiat API setting was refactored from a multi-choice `SettingsChoicesCell` to a simple on/off `SettingsSwitcherCell`. This simplifies the user experience for enabling or disabling the Fiat API.

The view model now maps `FiatApiMode.disabled` to `true` (for the switcher's `value`) and `FiatApiMode.enabled` to `false`.
