feat: Add Red Light, Red Dark, and Purple Dark themes

This commit introduces three new distinct theme options for users.

Key changes include:
- Adding `RedLightTheme`, `RedDarkTheme`, and `PurpleDarkTheme` classes.
- Deprecating and removing the `isDarkThemeLegacy` preference key and its associated logic.
- Updating the default theme selection to use `isMoneroOnly` for initial setup.
- Integrating new color definitions (`veryLightRed`, `red`, `darkPurple`) into the palette.
- Applying minor UI adjustments to dashboard padding and the home screen account widget layout.
- Updating `MoneroDarkTheme` menu styling for improved consistency.
- Including localization support for all new theme names.
