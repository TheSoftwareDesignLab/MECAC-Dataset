feat: Implement keyboard 'Done' button for exchange amounts

Integrates the `keyboard_actions` package to provide a 'Done' button in the
keyboard toolbar for deposit and receive amount input fields. This enhances
the user experience by allowing easy keyboard dismissal after inputting
amounts, especially on iOS.
