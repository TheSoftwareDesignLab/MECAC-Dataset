feat: Unify buy/sell providers and enhance MoonPay integration

- Consolidated `BuyProvider` to use a single `providerDescription` for both buy and sell options.
- Renamed `MoonPayBuyProvider` to `MoonPayProvider` and extended it to handle sell functionality.
- Replaced `BuyProviderType` enum and `BuyProviderHelper` with a more generic `ProviderType` and `ProvidersHelper`.
- Simplified seed phrase strength calculation for Ethereum and Polygon wallets.
- Added `mounted` checks in UI components for improved stability.
