refactor: Unify route creation and refine theme management

Introduced `handleRouteWithPlatformAwareness` to centralize platform-specific route creation (Material/Cupertino), significantly reducing code duplication in `createRoute`.
Streamlined theme mode setting logic in `ThemeStoreBase` by extracting preference saving and refining system theme initialization.
Removed commented-out code in `base_text_form_field.dart`.
