fix: Prevent UI overflow on restore pages and button titles

Wrapped `RestoreOptionsPage` and `RestoreWalletOptionsPage` with `SingleChildScrollView` to ensure content is always accessible, preventing overflow on smaller screens.
Increased `maxLines` for `RestoreButton` titles from 1 to 2, allowing longer titles to wrap without truncation.
Adjusted `RestoreButton` layout by replacing `Flexible` with `Container` for consistent sizing within the new scrollable context and simplified image embedding within the button widget.
