feat: Implement verbose TOTP 2FA settings and presets

Introduces granular control over when TOTP 2FA is required for various sensitive actions within the application.

Key changes include:
- Added `AuthService.authenticateAction` with `conditionToDetermineIfToUse2FA` for flexible 2FA enforcement.
- Implemented new 2FA presets: Narrow, Normal, and Aggressive.
- Introduced verbose control settings for:
    - Accessing wallets
    - Sending to contacts, non-contacts, and internal wallets
    - Exchanges to internal wallets
    - Adding contacts
    - Creating new wallets
    - All security and backup settings
- Updated `SettingsStore`, `BackupService`, and numerous UI screens/ViewModels to integrate and persist these new settings.
- Added new localization strings for 2FA presets and individual control options.

This enhancement allows users to customize their 2FA security levels more precisely based on their needs.
