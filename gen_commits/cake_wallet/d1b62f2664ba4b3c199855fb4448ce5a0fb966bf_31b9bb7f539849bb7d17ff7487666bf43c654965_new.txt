feat: Integrate in-app swap flow with 'Pay Anything'

This commit introduces a comprehensive in-app swap flow accessible from payment requests. It includes:
- `SwapConfirmationBottomSheet` for user input (amount, address) and provider selection.
- `SwapDetailsBottomSheet` to confirm trade details and initiate the send.
- Integration with `PaymentViewModel` to offer swap as an alternative for incompatible payment requests.
- Fiat amount display and input functionality for receive amounts during swaps.
- Ensures correct wallet context propagation to send-related view models (`Output`, `UnspentCoinsListViewModel`) during wallet switches.
