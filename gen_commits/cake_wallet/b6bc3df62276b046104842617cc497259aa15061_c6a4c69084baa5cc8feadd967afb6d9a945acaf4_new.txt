feat: Conditionally hide Silent Payments settings

The menu widget now dynamically filters the list of setting actions.
This commit ensures that the "Silent Payments Settings" option is
hidden from the dashboard menu if silent payments are not available
or enabled for the current wallet (checked via `hasSilentPayments`).

This improves the user experience by presenting only relevant options
and removes the need for conditional rendering within the list builder
by pre-filtering the data source.
