feat: Prompt Android users to disable battery optimization

Improves background synchronization reliability on Android by prompting users to disable battery optimization when they select an active sync mode.

This change:
- Adds the `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` permission to the Android manifest.
- Implements native Android methods (`disableBatteryOptimization`, `isBatteryOptimizationDisabled`) to interact with `PowerManager`.
- Integrates a pop-up prompt within the 'Connection & Sync' settings to request disabling optimization when a background sync mode (Unobtrusive or Aggressive) is selected on Android.
- Updates the 'Aggressive' sync mode interval from 6 hours to 1 hour.
- Adds corresponding localization strings.
