feat(security): Implement TOTP 2FA for enhanced wallet security

- Introduced Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP).
- Added dedicated screens for 2FA setup (QR code display, secret key entry) and modification.
- Integrated TOTP authentication into existing login, unlock, and sensitive action flows.
- Implemented `Setup2FAViewModel` to manage TOTP logic, including secret key generation, code verification, and a failed attempt ban mechanism.
- Stored 2FA settings (secret key, enabled status, failed trials) in `SettingsStore`.
- Added new localization strings across supported languages for 2FA messages.
- Included `base32` dependency for TOTP secret key handling.
