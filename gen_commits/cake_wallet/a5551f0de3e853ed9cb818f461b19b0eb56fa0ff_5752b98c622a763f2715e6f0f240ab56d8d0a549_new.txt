feat: Add theme-dependent images and refactor welcome/wallet layouts

Introduced light theme image variants for Welcome, New Wallet (name & type), and Seed screens.
Updated these screens to dynamically load images based on the active theme.
Refactored UI layouts for Welcome, New Wallet, and Seed pages to improve responsiveness and theme adaptability, replacing `ScrollableWithBottomSection`.
Enhanced `BaseTextFormField` to support configurable text and hint font sizes.
