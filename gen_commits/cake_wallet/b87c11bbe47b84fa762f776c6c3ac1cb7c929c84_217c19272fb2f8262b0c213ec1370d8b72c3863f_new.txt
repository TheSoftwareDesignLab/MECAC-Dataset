feat: Improve 2FA setup flow with a dedicated warning page

Repurposes the `WarningPage` to serve as a pre-setup warning for Cake 2FA, alongside its original use for seed phrase generation.

- Introduce a new image asset for the 2FA setup screen.
- Remove redundant "Important note" heading from 2FA setup UI.
- Allow customizable foreground and background colors for the `QrImage` widget.
- Streamline external link handling by directly launching URLs.
- Adjust DI and routing to support nullable parameters for `WarningPage`.
