feat: Implement message signing and verification across wallets

Introduced `signMessage` and `verifyMessage` methods in `WalletBase` and implemented them for all supported wallet types (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Wownero, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Tron, Nano).
Added new UI screens (`SignPage`, `SignForm`, `VerifyForm`) for users to sign and verify messages with their private keys.
Enhanced `AddressTextField` with an option to pick from existing wallet addresses.
Updated `DashboardViewModel` to expose message signing capability and `bitcoin_base` dependency.
