feat: Add description support to generic picker widget

The Picker widget now accepts an optional `description` string, which is
displayed at the bottom of the picker dialog.

This is used in the PresentProviderPicker to provide a hint when XMRto
is active, explaining that ChangeNOW or MorphToken may require a
different trading pair.
