refactor: Standardize alert dialog button order and colors

Reordered action and cancel buttons in `AlertWithTwoActions` widgets for consistency. Primary actions (e.g., delete, confirm) are now on the right with a red background, and secondary/cancel actions are on the left with a blue background.

Removed unused `cardColor` and `cardTheme` properties from `themes.dart`.
