fix(monero): Migrate wallets from outdated Android directory paths

Implement `repairOldAndroidWallet` to move existing wallet files from old Android application document paths to the new, app-specific directory. This ensures wallets created with previous app versions can still be loaded.

Further changes include:
- Refactor `MoneroAccountListBase.update` and `MoneroWalletBase.validate` methods to be synchronous, removing unnecessary `Future` return types and `await` calls.
- Correct typo by renaming `ValidableAnnotatedEditableText` to `ValidatableAnnotatedEditableText` and updating its usage.
- Change the keyboard type for seed phrase input to `TextInputType.visiblePassword` for better usability.
- Update `MoneroWalletLoadingException` message for clarity.
