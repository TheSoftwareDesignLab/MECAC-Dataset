feat(monero): Add BIP39 seed support

Introduce BIP39 seed phrase compatibility for Monero wallets.

This change set includes:
- Added `bip39` and `bip32` dependencies.
- Implemented `MoneroSeedType.bip39` for creating and restoring Monero wallets using 12-word BIP39 mnemonics.
- Logic to convert BIP39 seeds to Monero legacy seeds for wallet creation/restoration, while caching the original BIP39 seed.
- Updated wallet creation and restoration UI to support BIP39 seed selection and associated validation rules.
- Expanded Monero wallet service with new methods for BIP39 seed handling.
- Added comprehensive unit and integration tests for BIP39 seed functionality.
- Genericized Monero seed type titles in localization.
- Updated Dart SDK constraint.
