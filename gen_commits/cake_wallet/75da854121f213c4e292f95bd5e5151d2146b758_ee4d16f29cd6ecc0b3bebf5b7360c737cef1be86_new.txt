feat: Make contact list sections collapsible

Introduces `CollapsibleSectionList`, an extension of `SectionStandardList`, which adds collapsible functionality to list sections using `ExpansionTile`.
This new widget is applied to `ContactListPage` to allow sections like "Contacts" and "Frequented" to be collapsed and expanded.
Refactors `SectionStandardList` to support theme customization and method overrides for extension.
