feat: Integrate ThorChain exchange and add transaction memo support

This commit introduces ThorChain as a new exchange provider, enabling cross-chain swaps.
It also adds comprehensive support for transaction memos (OP_RETURN data) across Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and EVM chains, which is essential for ThorChain's functionality.

Key changes include:
- Added `ThorChainExchangeProvider` and its associated logic.
- Implemented `memo` field in `OutputInfo` and `Trade` models.
- Extended `ElectrumWallet`, `BitcoinTransactionBuilder`, `BitcoinCashWallet`, and `EVMChainClient` to support `OP_RETURN` or transaction `data`.
- Added validation for ThorChain transactions, including a check for Taproot addresses.
- Updated UI elements and internationalization strings for the new provider and memo features.
