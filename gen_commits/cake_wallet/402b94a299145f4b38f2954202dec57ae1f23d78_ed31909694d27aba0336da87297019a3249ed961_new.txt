refactor: Improve layout of settings text list row

The `title` and `trailing` elements of `SettingsTextListRow` are now
contained within a `Row` using `spaceBetween` alignment. This ensures
the title text and the accompanying widget are always on the same line
and handle space distribution effectively via `Flexible` widgets,
improving visual consistency and preventing overflow.
