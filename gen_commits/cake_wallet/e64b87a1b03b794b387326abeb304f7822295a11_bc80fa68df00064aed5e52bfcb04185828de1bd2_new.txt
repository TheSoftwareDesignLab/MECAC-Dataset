feat: Enhance balance visibility and interaction

This commit refines the user experience for managing balance visibility:
- Changed balance toggle from tap to long press on the balance row.
- A short press now displays an instructional toast message.
- Hidden 'available balance' is now obfuscated with '●●●●●●'
  instead of '---', and fiat balances show 'CUR ●●●●●'.
- 'Additional balance' is no longer obfuscated and shows '0.0' when hidden.
- Includes minor UI adjustments and internal refactoring within the
  BalanceViewModel for improved consistency and maintainability.
- New localized strings were added to support these UI changes.
