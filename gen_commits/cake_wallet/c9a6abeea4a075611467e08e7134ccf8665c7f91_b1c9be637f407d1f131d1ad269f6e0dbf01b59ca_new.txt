feat: Revamp balance display and refine balance calculations

Overhauled the Balance Page UI, introducing a tabbed view for crypto and NFTs on EVM chains, and splitting components into `BalancePage`, `CryptoBalanceWidget`, and `BalanceRowWidget`.
Integrated unconfirmed amounts into the available balance for Electrum-based wallets (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash).
Corrected Electrum frozen balance calculation to exclude silent payment outputs.
Refactored Monero and Wownero balance models for explicit representation of unconfirmed, unlocked, and frozen amounts.
Enhanced Monero frozen balance accuracy.
Added 'frozen_balance' localization string.
