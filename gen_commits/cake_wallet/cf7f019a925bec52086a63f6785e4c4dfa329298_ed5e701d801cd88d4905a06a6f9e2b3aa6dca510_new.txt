feat: Improve custom contact list ordering and lifecycle

Refactors the lifecycle management of the `ContactListViewModel`, moving its disposal to a higher-level state widget.

Extracts the logic for saving custom contact order into a dedicated `saveCustomOrder` method within the view model. This method is now conditionally invoked when the custom order setting is active during contact list disposal.

Introduces an `isEditable` flag to dynamically control the displayed contact list and the visibility of the filter button, enhancing the user experience for custom reordering.
