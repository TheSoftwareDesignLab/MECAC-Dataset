feat(walletconnect): Enhance EVM typed message display and WCv2 redirect

Refactor EVM chain service to dynamically parse and display EIP-712 typed data messages, replacing static field extraction with a generic formatting approach for better readability. Add native redirect URI for WalletConnect v2 sessions.

Other changes include:
- Streamline Solana chain service response handling and simplify error messages.
- Improve WalletConnect pairing and session request widget UI.
- Implement robust image error handling for network and asset images.
- Add common SVG parsing errors to the exception handler ignore list.
