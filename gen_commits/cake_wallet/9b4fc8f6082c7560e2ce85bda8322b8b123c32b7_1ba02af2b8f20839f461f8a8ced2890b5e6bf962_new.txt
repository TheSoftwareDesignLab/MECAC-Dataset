refactor: Modernize button styling with ButtonStyle

Replaced `ButtonTheme` with `SizedBox` for dimension control.
Migrated all `TextButton` styling from deprecated properties to `ButtonStyle`.
Implemented `backgroundColor`, `shape` (rounded borders), and `overlayColor` using `MaterialStateProperty.all`.
Removed old commented-out styling and FIX-ME notes, ensuring consistent button appearance and adherence to current Flutter API recommendations.
