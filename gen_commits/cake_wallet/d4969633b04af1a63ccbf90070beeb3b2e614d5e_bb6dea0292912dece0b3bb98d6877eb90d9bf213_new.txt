feat: Implement wallet renaming and improved management

This commit introduces the ability for users to rename their wallets across various cryptocurrency types (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Haven).

Key changes include:
- Added `rename` method to `WalletService` and its specific wallet type implementations.
- Implemented file system operations (`renameWalletFiles`) to copy wallet data to new paths and delete old directories.
- Enhanced wallet `remove` logic to also delete associated wallet metadata from `walletInfoSource`.
- Introduced `WalletLoadingService.renameWallet` to orchestrate password and wallet information updates in secure storage and Hive.
- Added `KeyService.deleteWalletPassword` to correctly manage wallet passwords during rename and delete.
- Created a new `WalletEditPage` and `WalletEditViewModel` to provide a dedicated interface for renaming and deleting individual wallets.
- Refactored `WalletListPage` to direct wallet editing and deletion to the new `WalletEditPage`, removing the `Slidable` actions.
- Updated node management in `ConnectionSyncPage` to move edit/delete actions to `NodeCreateOrEditPage`, improving UX for node configuration.
- Added necessary string resources for localization.
