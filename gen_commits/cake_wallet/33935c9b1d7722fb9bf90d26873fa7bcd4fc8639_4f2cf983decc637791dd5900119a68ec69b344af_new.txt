fix: Migrate from flushbar to another_flushbar package

Migrates the `flushbar` dependency to `another_flushbar` to fix previous compatibility issues.
Re-enables and updates toast/progress bar implementations in `AuthPage`, `PinCodeWidget`, and `WalletListPage`.
Adjusts flushbar durations to `null` for indefinite display when needed.
Introduces a `dismissFlushBar` helper and refactors `AuthPageState.close` for safer UI operations.
Wraps state updates and navigation calls in `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` for improved stability.
