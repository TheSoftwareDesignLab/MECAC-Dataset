feat: Add Robinhood Connect and enhance buy provider selection

Introduce Robinhood Connect as a new fiat-to-crypto buy provider for BTC, LTC, and ETH. Rework the buy flow with a `BuyOptionsPage` to choose between providers or set a default in settings. Implement message signing for BTC and ETH wallets. Refactor common UI elements into a reusable `OptionTile` widget.
