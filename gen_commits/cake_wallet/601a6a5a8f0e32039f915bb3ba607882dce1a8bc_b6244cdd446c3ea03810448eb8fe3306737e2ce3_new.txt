perf: Optimize THORChain name resolution

- Prevents unnecessary network requests to ThorChainExchangeProvider.
- ThorChain address lookup now only occurs if the input string:
  - Is 30 characters or less.
  - Is not already recognized as a standard cryptocurrency address.
- Removes unused `picker.dart` import.
