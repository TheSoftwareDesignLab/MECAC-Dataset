refactor: Implement new extensive design system and themes

Introduce new color constants in `palette.dart`. Overhaul `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` definitions in `themes.dart` with comprehensive `TextTheme` properties for granular styling. Migrate numerous UI widgets from direct color references to `Theme.of(context)` properties for consistent theming. Update base page and dashboard backgrounds, and add new `bitcoin_menu.png` assets.
