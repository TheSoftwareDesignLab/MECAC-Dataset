refactor(exchange): Unify exchange and template page logic

Extracted common UI and state management for exchange and exchange template pages into `BaseExchangeWidget`. Created `PresentProviderPicker` to centralize exchange provider selection UI.

Added `isDepositAddressEnabled` and `isReceiveAddressEnabled` to `ExchangeStore` for dynamic control over address field editability. Also internationalized "New template" title with `exchange_new_template` key and updated `AddressTextField` to support disabled border styles.
