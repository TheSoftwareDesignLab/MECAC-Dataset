refactor: Centralize contact list filtering logic

The ContactListViewModel now directly receives the CryptoCurrency parameter
during instantiation, enabling it to manage currency-specific contact
and wallet filtering internally via computed properties.

This decouples ContactListPage from direct currency handling, simplifying
its logic and improving separation of concerns.
