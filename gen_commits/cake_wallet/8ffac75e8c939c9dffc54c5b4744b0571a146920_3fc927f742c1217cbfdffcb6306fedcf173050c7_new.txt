feat: Implement in-app release notes display

Introduces a Release Notes screen that automatically appears when the app is launched after an update.
The app now tracks the last seen app version and distinguishes between updates and fresh installations.
Includes new preference keys for `lastSeenAppVersion` and `isNewInstall`, along with a `VersionComparator` utility.
Refactors `AlertCloseButton` usage across various screens.
