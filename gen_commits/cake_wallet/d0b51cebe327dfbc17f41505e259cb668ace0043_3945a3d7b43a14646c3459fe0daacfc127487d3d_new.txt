feat: Add new localizations, improve send flow and camera description

- **feat(i18n)**: Added numerous new localization strings across multiple languages to support upcoming features (e.g., Robinhood integration, background sync, 2FA, wallet sweeping) and enhance existing descriptions.
- **docs(ios)**: Clarified `NSCameraUsageDescription` in `InfoBase.plist` to explicitly mention image capture for identification.
- **fix(send)**: Ensured correct currency selection in `AddressTextField` for both `SendCard` and `SendTemplateCard` widgets.
- **refactor**: Optimized `ExceptionHandler` by using a static file object for error logging.
- **chore(tools)**: Implemented automatic alphabetization of `.arb` files in the translation consistency script.
