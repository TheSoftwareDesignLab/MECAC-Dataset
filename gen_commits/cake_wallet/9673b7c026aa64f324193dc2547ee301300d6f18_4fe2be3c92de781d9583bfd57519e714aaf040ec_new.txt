feat: Revamp Wallet Keys and Seed pages with tabbed view

This commit significantly refactors the Wallet Seed and Wallet Keys pages to improve UI/UX and code organization.

- Introduces a tabbed interface on the Wallet Keys page to separate "Seed", "Keys", and "Legacy" (for Monero/Wownero Polyseed).
- Extracts common UI components into new reusable widgets:
    - `SeedPhraseGridWidget`: For displaying seed phrases in a grid.
    - `WarningBox`: For consistent warning messages.
    - `TextInfoBox`: For displaying key-value pairs with copy functionality.
- Consolidates seed display logic into the Wallet Keys page for a unified experience.
- Adds block height display for relevant wallet types.
- Provides dedicated copy and QR actions for seed phrases and keys.
- Updates `WalletKeysViewModel` to support the new tabbed structure and data handling.
