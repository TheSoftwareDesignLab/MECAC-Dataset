feat: Introduce Payjoin support for Bitcoin wallets

This release integrates the Payjoin (BIP-78) protocol for Bitcoin transactions.
Users can now opt-in to send and receive Payjoin-enabled transactions, enhancing privacy by making transaction analysis harder.

Key changes include:
- **Core Payjoin Logic**: Implemented `PayjoinManager` and worker isolates for handling Payjoin sending and receiving sessions.
- **PSBT Integration**: Refactored PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) handling with dedicated signer, deserializer, and finalizer components for robust signing flows.
- **Wallet Integration**: Updated `BitcoinWallet` and `BitcoinWalletAddresses` to manage Payjoin sessions, generate Payjoin-compatible URIs, and handle transaction creation/committing for Payjoin.
- **UI Enhancements**:
    - Added a "Use Payjoin" toggle in privacy settings.
    - Updated receive screen QR codes to display Payjoin URI and status.
    - Introduced new transaction list items and a dedicated details page for Payjoin sessions.
- **State Management**: Implemented `PayjoinSession` for persistent storage and `PayjoinTransactionsStore` for managing Payjoin session states.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Ensured Payjoin sessions are correctly resumed and cleaned up across app lifecycle events.
- **Dependencies**: Added `payjoin_flutter` and updated Ledger Bitcoin library.
