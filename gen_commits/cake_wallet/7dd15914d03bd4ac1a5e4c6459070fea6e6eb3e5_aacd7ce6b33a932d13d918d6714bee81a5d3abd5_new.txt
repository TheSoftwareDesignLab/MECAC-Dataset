feat(seed): Normalize input for Polyseed French & Spanish

Refactor text normalization logic from `cw_bitcoin` to a new `cw_core/utils/text_normalizer.dart` utility.
Conditionally apply Unicode normalization (NFD, lowercase, combining character removal, CJK space handling) to seed phrase input for Polyseed French and Spanish languages.
This ensures proper validation against the wordlist for these specific languages.
Moved `unorm_dart` dependency from `cw_bitcoin` to `cw_core`.
Updated `polyseed` dependency to `^0.0.5`.
