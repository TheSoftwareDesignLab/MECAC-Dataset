feat: Update default Ethereum and Polygon RPC nodes

Updated public node URIs for Ethereum and Polygon to their rpc-suffixed variants (e.g., ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com) in `assets` and `default_settings_migration`.
Enabled SSL and marked these as default nodes. Added migration logic to ensure existing user-configured nodes are updated to these new, secure endpoints.

Temporarily disabled the Solana `_isEnoughSolForMintRentExemption` function by commenting out its logic and making it always return true. This is a workaround as the original implementation was not correctly calculating rent exemption, with a TODO added for future re-implementation.
