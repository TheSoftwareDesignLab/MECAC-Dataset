feat: Implement automatic node switching

Introduces a new service to monitor the health of the currently connected node and automatically switch to an alternative trusted node if it becomes unresponsive.

Key changes include:
*   Added `NodeSwitchingService` to manage health checks and node switching.
*   Implemented `checkNodeHealth` method for all wallet types to verify node connectivity and responsiveness.
*   Added `isEnabledForAutoSwitching` property to `Node` model and updated existing default nodes to use it.
*   Integrated node health verification into wallet sync processes for EVM, Solana, and Tron.
*   Added UI settings to enable/disable global automatic node switching and to configure auto-switching for individual nodes.
*   Increased migration version to 50 and included a migration script to enable auto-switching for default nodes.
