refactor: Enhance UI text, button colors, and social media link

- Updated various in-app strings for improved clarity and consistency across languages,
  including renaming "subaddress" to "address", clarifying reconnection prompts,
  and refining wallet restore instructions.
- Standardized button colors on account and address creation/edit pages to use
  the accent theme color for better UI consistency.
- Updated the Twitter handle link in settings from `@CakeWalletXMR` to `@cakewallet`.
