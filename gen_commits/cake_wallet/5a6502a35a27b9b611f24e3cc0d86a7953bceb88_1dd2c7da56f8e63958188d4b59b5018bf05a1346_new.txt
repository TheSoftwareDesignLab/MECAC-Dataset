fix: Improve Electrum connections and UI error handling

- Ensure `useSSL` is consistently applied when connecting or reconnecting to Electrum nodes.
- Handle `RequestFailedTimeoutException` during DFX tweak retrieval to prevent crashes.
- Add `if (mounted)` checks to prevent `setState` calls on unmounted widgets.
- Verify `navigatorKey.currentContext` before showing popups in exception handler.
- Refactor `onConnectionStatusChange` callback to a dedicated private method in `ElectrumWalletBase`.
- Call `getCurrentChainTip` before processing transaction history to ensure up-to-date data.
- Update DFX option description in multiple languages for better clarity.
