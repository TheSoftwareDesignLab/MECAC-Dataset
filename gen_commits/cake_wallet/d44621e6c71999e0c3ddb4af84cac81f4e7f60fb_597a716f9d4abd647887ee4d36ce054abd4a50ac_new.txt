refactor: Internationalize transaction-related UI strings

- Convert hardcoded strings (e.g., "Confirm Transaction", "Generating transaction", "Transaction Sent") to use localization keys (`S.of(context)`) across CakePay, Exchange, Send, and RBF screens.
- Add new localization keys for "Confirm transaction" and "Generating transaction" to ARB files.
- feat: Implement a post-transaction flow on the Send page to navigate to the dashboard, trigger an app review request, and clear the new contact address.
- style: Adjust `ConfirmSendingBottomSheet` text styles, padding, and address display to prevent overflow and improve responsiveness.
- fix: Resolve duplicate translation keys (`please_reference_document`, `Payment_was_received`) in German and Hindi ARB files.
