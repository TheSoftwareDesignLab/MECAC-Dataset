- Added a "What is Payjoin?" informational link with a help icon on the Bitcoin balance page, along with new localization strings.
- Standardized the `StandardSwitch` API by renaming `onTaped` to `onTapped` for better consistency.
- Corrected the `UnderlineInputBorder` border style in `BaseTextFormField` for zero-width borders.
