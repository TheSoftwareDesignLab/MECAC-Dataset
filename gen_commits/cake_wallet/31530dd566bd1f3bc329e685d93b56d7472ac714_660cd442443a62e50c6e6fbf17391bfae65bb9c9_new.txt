fix: 2FA: Open URLs in external app and update theme

Ensures that all URLs launched within the 2FA setup process are
opened using an external application, improving consistency and
user experience.

Also updates the theme extension reference for the QR code border
color from DashboardPageTheme to CakeTextTheme to reflect recent
theming system changes.
