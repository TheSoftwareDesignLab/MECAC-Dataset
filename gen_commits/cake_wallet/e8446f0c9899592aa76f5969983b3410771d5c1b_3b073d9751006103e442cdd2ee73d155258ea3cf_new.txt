refactor: Improve Ionia marketplace flow and navigation

- Extracted Ionia authentication check into `MarketPlaceViewModel`.
- Updated `MarketPlacePage` to use `MarketPlaceViewModel` for Ionia navigation logic.
- Revised `IoniaWelcomePage` and `IoniaGiftCardsListViewModel` dependencies.
- Changed AnonPay routes from `pushReplacementNamed` to `pushNamed` for proper back navigation.
- Modified AnonPay Invoice page back navigation to return directly to the Dashboard.
- Removed `fullscreenDialog` attribute from Wallet Restore and AnonPay routes.
- Added keyboard dismissal before navigation on Wallet Restore.
- Implemented search bar focus management in `IoniaManageCardsPage` on back button press.
