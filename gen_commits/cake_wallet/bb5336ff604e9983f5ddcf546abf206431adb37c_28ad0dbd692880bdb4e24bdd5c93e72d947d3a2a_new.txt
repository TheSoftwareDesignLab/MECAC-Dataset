refactor: Rename frozen balance to unavailable balance

This commit renames 'frozen balance' to 'unavailable balance' for improved clarity and consistency.

Changes include:
- Renaming balance properties in `Balance` and `MoneroBalance` classes.
- Adjusting `MoneroBalance` calculations to correctly represent unavailable funds.
- Updating the dashboard UI to display 'Unavailable balance' with an informative description tooltip.
- Removing old localization strings and adding new ones for 'unavailable_balance' and its description across multiple languages.
