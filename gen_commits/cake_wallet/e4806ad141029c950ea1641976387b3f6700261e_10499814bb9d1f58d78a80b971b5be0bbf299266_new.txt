feat: Implement Bitcoin view-only wallets and PSBT/UR support

This release introduces support for Bitcoin view-only wallets, enabling air-gapped
transaction signing workflows using PSBTs encoded as UR or BBQR.

- **View-only wallets:** Allow restoring Bitcoin wallets with an xPub.
- **PSBT/UR/BBQR integration:** Facilitates offline transaction signing via QR codes
  with companion apps (e.g., Cupcake App).
- **BIP353 DNSSEC support:** Embeds DNSSEC proofs for validated Bitcoin addresses
  directly into PSBT outputs.
- **Tooling updates:** Bumps Flutter to 3.27.4, NDK to r28, and updates Docker images.
  Adds `ur`, `bbqrdart`, and `dnssec_proof` dependencies.
