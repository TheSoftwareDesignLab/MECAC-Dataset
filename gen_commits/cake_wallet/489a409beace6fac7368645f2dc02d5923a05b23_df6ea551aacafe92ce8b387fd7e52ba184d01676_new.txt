feat: Add extraId support for exchange trades and enhance Exolix limits

This commit introduces `extraId` (deposit memo/destination tag) support across several exchange providers and integrates it into the UI.

- **Exchange Extra ID:**
    - `extraId` field added to the `Trade` model.
    - `extraId` is now fetched and stored for LetsExchange, SideShift, StealthEx, and Trocador trades.
    - Displayed in trade list cards and the detailed trade view with a dynamically adjusted label (e.g., "Destination Tag" for XRP, "Memo" for XLM).
    - The `extraId` can now be copied from the detailed trade view.

- **Exolix Provider Enhancements:**
    - `fetchLimits` now correctly retrieves and stores `maxAmount`.
    - Implemented a retry mechanism (up to 2 attempts) for `fetchLimits` to handle `HTTP 422` errors, retrying with a suggested `minAmount` if provided in the error response.
    - Added a `_toDouble` utility for robust parsing of amount values.
