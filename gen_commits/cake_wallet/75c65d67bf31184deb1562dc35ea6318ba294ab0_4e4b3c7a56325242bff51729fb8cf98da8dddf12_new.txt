feat: Add Yoruba (yo) language support and refactor localization

- Implements full localization for Yoruba, including UI strings, date/time formats, and flag.
- Refactors existing Hausa (ha) localization by moving files to `lib/locales/`.
- Centralizes all localization delegates into `lib/locales/locale.dart` for improved structure.
- Updates `README.md` to list the new supported language.
- Fixes a minor typo in `strings_en.arb`.
