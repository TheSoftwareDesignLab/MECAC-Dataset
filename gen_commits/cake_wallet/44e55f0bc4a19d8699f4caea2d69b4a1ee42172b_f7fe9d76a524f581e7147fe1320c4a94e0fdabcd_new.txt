refactor: Use theme accent text colors for primary buttons

Updated PrimaryButton instances to derive their `color` and `textColor` from `Theme.of(context).accentTextTheme` properties. This ensures UI consistency and better aligns with the application's theming system, replacing hardcoded `Colors.green` and `Colors.white`.

Affected buttons include:
- Disclaimer page: 'Accept' button
- Wallet Restore page: 'Recover' button

Also bumped `path_provider` dependency to version `1.6.22`.
