refactor: Unify color management across themes and UI

This commit significantly refactors the application's theming system.
Colors are now consistently managed and accessed through
`Theme.of(context).accentTextTheme` properties, replacing scattered
`Colors.white` or simple theme property usages in UI widgets.

Key changes:
*   Redefined `lightTheme`, `brightTheme`, and `darkTheme` to map specific
    UI element colors to `accentTextTheme` properties.
*   Updated dashboard, exchange, receive, and send screens to utilize the
    new theme color mappings for dynamic styling.
*   Corrected the `brightTheme` to correctly use its own definition.
*   Updated `lib/palette.dart` with new colors, an adjusted existing color,
    and removed unused/temporary color definitions and comments.

This improves theme switching flexibility and overall style maintainability.
