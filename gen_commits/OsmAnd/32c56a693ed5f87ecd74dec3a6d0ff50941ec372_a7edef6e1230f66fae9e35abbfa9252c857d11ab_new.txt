feat: Add coordinates widget to map top bar

Introduces a new widget to display the current GPS location's coordinates on the map's top bar. It supports various formats (Lat/Lon, UTM, OLC), updates in real-time, and allows copying or sharing coordinates. A new preference controls its visibility.

Refactors coordinate conversion logic in `LocationConvert.java` to improve reusability and handle cardinal directions. Unifies visibility handling across map widgets using `AndroidUiHelper`.
