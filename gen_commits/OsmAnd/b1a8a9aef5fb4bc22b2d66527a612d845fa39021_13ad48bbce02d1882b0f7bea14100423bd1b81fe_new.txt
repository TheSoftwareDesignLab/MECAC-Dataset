refactor: Isolate GPX navigation into dedicated helper

Moved all GPX navigation related methods from ExternalApiHelper to the
new NavigateGpxHelper class. This includes logic for saving, displaying,
approximating, and starting navigation for GPX tracks.

This change improves modularity and separates concerns within the codebase.
Existing calls in OsmandAidlApi and ExternalApiHelper have been updated.
