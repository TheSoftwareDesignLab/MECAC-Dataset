refactor(amenity): Centralize additional info processing

Moved the logic for handling amenity additional info, collecting POI categories,
and deriving alternate names from `AmenityExtensionsHelper` into a new
`getAdditionalInfoAndCollectCategories` method within the `Amenity` class.

This improves encapsulation and promotes reusability, as the method is now
called from `AmenityExtensionsHelper` and `QuickSearchListItem`.
`Amenity.getInternalAdditionalInfoMap()` is now private, and
`MapObject.isContentZipped()` is public.
Added `Amenity.hasAdditionalInfo()` for convenience.
