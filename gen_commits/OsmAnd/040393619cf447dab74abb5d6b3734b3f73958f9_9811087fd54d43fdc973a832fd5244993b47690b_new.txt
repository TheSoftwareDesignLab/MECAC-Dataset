feat(i18n/hy): Add auto-continue prompt for previous route

The Armenian translation file `strings.xml` was updated:
- Introduced the `continue_follow_previous_route_auto` string, adding a new
  prompt for automatically continuing unfinished navigation routes with
  a visible countdown.
- Corrected file encoding by removing the Byte Order Mark (BOM).
- Improved file readability by formatting previously merged `<string>`
  tags onto separate lines.
