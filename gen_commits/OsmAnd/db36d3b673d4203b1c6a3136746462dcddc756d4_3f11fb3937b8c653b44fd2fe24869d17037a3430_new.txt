feat: Enhance Add New Device form with validation and loading

This commit introduces several improvements to the 'Add New Device' bottom sheet:

- **Input Validation**: Added checks for empty, excessively long, and duplicate device names.
- **Loading State**: A progress bar is displayed on the 'Add' button during device creation for better user feedback.
- **Success Notification**: Displays a toast message upon successful device addition.
- **Code Refactoring**: Improved JSON serialization logic in `TelegramSettings` for better readability and error handling.
