feat: Persist map linked to location state

Introduce `linkMapToLocation` to remember the map's follow-location state.
Restore `isMapLinkedToLocation` from the remembered state when MapActivity resumes. This ensures the map maintains its following/unfollowing status across lifecycle events.
Refine auto-follow logic to only activate when a route is actively being followed.
