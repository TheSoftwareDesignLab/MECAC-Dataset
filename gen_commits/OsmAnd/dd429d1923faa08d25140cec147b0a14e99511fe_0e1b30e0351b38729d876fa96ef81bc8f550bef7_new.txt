fix: Adjust text alignment and remove inactive router logic

The `GeneralRouter.calculateTurnTime` method no longer contains a commented-out block for handling traffic signals. This block was already inactive due to its `return 0;` statement being commented out. Removing it cleans up vestigial code.

The `TextRenderer` now correctly adjusts the vertical offset for text drawn on a path. The `vOffset` is updated to account for `paintText.ascent()/2 + paintText.descent()` for improved vertical centering, and a related `p.vOffset` adjustment in `calculatePathToRotate` has been removed.
