refactor: Standardize UI colors and spacing in layouts

Standardized UI elements by replacing hardcoded dimensions (`dp`) with `@dimen` resources and specific color values with `?android:textColorSecondary`. This improves overall UI consistency, dark mode compatibility, and maintainability. Also updated `gravity` attributes for enhanced RTL support.
