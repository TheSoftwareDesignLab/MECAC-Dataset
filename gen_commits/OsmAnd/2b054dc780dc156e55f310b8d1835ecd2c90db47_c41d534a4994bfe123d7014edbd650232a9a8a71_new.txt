feat: Enhance UI with FontFitTextView and refine title bar layouts

Introduces a new `FontFitTextView` component to dynamically adjust text
size to fit within its bounds, preventing text truncation.

Refactors title bar layouts, creating `titlebar_extrabutton.xml` for
specialized configurations and updating `CustomTitleBarWithExtraButton`
to utilize it.

Adjusts horizontal margins for text views in `local_index.xml` from 3dp to
10dp for improved visual spacing.
