fix: Correctly update favorite group color image

The `updateColorView` method was previously called with the `R.id.change_color_icon`
ImageView. This commit now passes the `R.id.colorImage` ImageView, which is
the intended target for displaying the selected color, resolving an issue
where the color display might not update correctly.
