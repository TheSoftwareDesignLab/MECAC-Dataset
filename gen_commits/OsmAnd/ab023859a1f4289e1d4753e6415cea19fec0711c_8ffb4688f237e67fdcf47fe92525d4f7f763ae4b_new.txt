feat: Allow adding measurement points by tapping on map

Introduces the ability to add new points to the measurement tool path by single-tapping on the map.
The logic for adding a point and updating the UI was extracted into a dedicated method. A listener mechanism was implemented to communicate map single taps from the MeasurementToolLayer to the MeasurementToolFragment.
