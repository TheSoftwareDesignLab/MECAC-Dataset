feat: Enhance profile editing and mode activation

Makes profile input fields more descriptive (e.g., "Profile Name",
"Navigation Type"). Explicitly sets the application mode when navigating
from profile settings to ensure the selected profile is active.
Disables auto-filling/selecting of the profile name field for new
custom profiles and removes automatic back navigation after saving.
