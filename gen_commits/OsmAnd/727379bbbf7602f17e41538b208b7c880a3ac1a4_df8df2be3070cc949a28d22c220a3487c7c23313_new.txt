fix: Apply selectable background only to enabled items

Ensures that interactive visual feedback, such as the selectable background, is only shown for list items that are currently enabled. This applies to items in the `ChangeItemActionsBottomSheet` (download/upload actions) and general `ItemViewHolder` instances in the backup status UI. This improves UI consistency and user experience by preventing disabled items from appearing interactive.
