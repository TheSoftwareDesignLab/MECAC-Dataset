feat: Dynamically update map context menu favorite action text

Adds IDs to context menu action TextViews and implements dynamic text updates for the "Favorite" action. This ensures the action text (e.g., "Add to Favorites" or "Remove from Favorites") accurately reflects the current state of the selected point. The string resource used for this action was also updated.
