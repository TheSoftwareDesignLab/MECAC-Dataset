feat: Dynamic 'Add/Edit POI' label and improved menu descriptions

Enhances the map context menu by dynamically changing the 'Add' action to 'Edit' when a favorite point is selected, both triggering the same favorite point creation/editing flow.

Significantly improves descriptions for various menu items within the 'Rearrange Menu' settings, providing more specific context for features like GPX, online maps, and OSM tools. The 'Create POI' item is now labeled 'Create/Edit POI'.

Includes minor UI layout adjustments for profile edit list items and a string comparison refactor.
