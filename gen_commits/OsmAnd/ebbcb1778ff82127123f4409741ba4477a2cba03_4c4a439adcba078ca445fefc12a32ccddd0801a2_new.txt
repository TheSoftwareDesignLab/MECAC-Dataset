feat: Dynamically adjust margin for online routing vehicle card

Refactors `removeBottomMarginSelectionMenu` to `updateBottomMarginSelectionMenu`
to allow setting an arbitrary bottom margin. The vehicle card's selection menu
now receives a bottom margin when `VehicleType.CUSTOM` is selected, improving
layout for subsequent input fields.
