fix: Improve drawer list item vertical alignment and height

Vertically centers the icon, text container, and checkbox within the list item.
Adjusts the root layout height to `wrap_content` with a `minHeight` of 48dp
to allow for content expansion while maintaining a minimum size.
Adds `tools` attributes for improved design-time rendering.
