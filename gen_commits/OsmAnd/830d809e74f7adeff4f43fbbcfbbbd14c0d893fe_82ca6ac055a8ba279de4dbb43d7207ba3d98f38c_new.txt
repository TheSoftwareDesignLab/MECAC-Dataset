feat: Implement travel guide download/update card

Introduces a new UI component for displaying download and update information for travel guides.
This includes a new layout file (travel_download_update_card.xml), dedicated drawable assets (travel_card_download_icon, travel_card_update_icon, travel_card_stroke_bg), new dimension (travel_card_title_text_size), and theme attributes/colors (wikivoyage_primary_btn_text_color) for styling.
