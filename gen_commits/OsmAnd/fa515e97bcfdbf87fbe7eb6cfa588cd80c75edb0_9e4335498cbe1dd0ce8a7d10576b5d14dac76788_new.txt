feat: Add icon and color-coding to context menu additional info

Introduce `additional_info_image_view` to display an icon alongside the additional information text in the map context menu. Implement dynamic color-coding for opening hours status (open/closed) within the additional info section. Refactor `getAdditionalInfoColor` to `getAdditionalInfoColorId` for consistency and clarity. Adjust the format of opening hours comments from `(comment)` to `- comment`.
