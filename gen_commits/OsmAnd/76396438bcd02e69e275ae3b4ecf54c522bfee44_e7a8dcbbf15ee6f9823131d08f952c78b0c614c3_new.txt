fix: Correct location sharing widget status

The location sharing widget now accurately reflects the current sharing state.
It will display as 'not sending' if location sharing is explicitly turned off,
even if there are buffered messages or a stale 'sending' status.
Also, tapping the widget now directly opens the "My Location" tab in the app.
