fix: Suppress single tap after two-finger tap zoom

The `afterTwoFingersTap` flag was uncommented and integrated to prevent `onSingleTapConfirmed` events immediately following a two-finger tap. This ensures a single tap is not registered after the zoom out gesture, mirroring the existing behavior for double taps.
