refactor: Migrate map layers to float coordinates and improve animations

Replaced `TIntArrayList` with `List<Float>` for pixel coordinates in several map layers, allowing for more precise floating-point coordinate handling.
Enhanced `RouteLayer` drawing by adjusting arrow spacing with zoom coefficient and preventing arrow rendering during zoom animations for non-walk lines.
Introduced `OsmandMapTileView.isAnimatingZoom()` to support animation-aware rendering logic.
