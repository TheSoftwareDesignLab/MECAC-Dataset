refactor: Consolidate zoom level configuration UI

The `TerrainZoomLevelsFragment` has been removed. All zoom level configuration UI now leverages the generic `ZoomLevelsFragment` and its associated `ZoomLevelsController` instances.

Key changes include:
- `ZoomLevelsController` now provides default dialog title and summary.
- The `onBackPressed` callback was renamed to `onCloseScreen` for clarity.
- `TerrainZoomLevelsController` was refactored to directly update terrain zoom values as the slider changes and manage apply/cancel states more explicitly.
- `GridZoomLevelsController` constants were renamed for better clarity, and `OsmandSettings` updated accordingly.
