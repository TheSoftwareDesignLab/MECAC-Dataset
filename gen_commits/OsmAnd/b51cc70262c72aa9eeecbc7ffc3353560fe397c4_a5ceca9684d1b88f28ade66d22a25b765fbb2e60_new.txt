feat: Add intermediate waypoints to BROUTER routing

The BROUTER routing service now supports intermediate waypoints.
Previously, the BROUTER request only included start and end points.
This enhancement allows passing `params.intermediates` to the BROUTER
service for more complex route calculations.
