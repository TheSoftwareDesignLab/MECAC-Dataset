feat(l10n): Update Czech localization for v0.7.0 and preferences

This commit comprehensively updates the Czech (cs) string resources.
Key changes include:
- New strings for OsmAnd 0.7.0 features, such as offline Wikipedia POIs, updated maps, and free version messages.
- A significant rework of strings related to the new Preferences structure, covering settings profiles, rendering, appearance, monitoring, and routing.
- Addition of new region names for map download categories (e.g., North America, Europe).
- Updates to informational tips for day/night mode, map rotation, and OSM improvements to reflect new menu navigation paths.
