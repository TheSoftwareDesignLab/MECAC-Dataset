refactor(map): Rename auto-follow to auto-return, remove nav-only option

The "auto-follow route" terminology has been updated to "map view auto return" for improved clarity in both English and German UI strings.
Additionally, the 'Auto return nav only' preference (`AUTO_FOLLOW_ROUTE_NAV`) has been removed from the settings menu and underlying logic to simplify the navigation preference menu.
