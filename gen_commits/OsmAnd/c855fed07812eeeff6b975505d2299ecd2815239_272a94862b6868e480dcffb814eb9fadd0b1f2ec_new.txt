refactor: Extract ViewChangeProvider to custom Layout/Frame classes

Moved the ViewChangeProvider implementation, including onSizeChanged,
onVisibilityChanged, and viewChangeListeners, into new FrameLayoutEx
and LinearLayoutEx custom view classes.

Updated existing UI components (SideWidgetsPanel, VerticalWidgetPanel,
MapButton, TopToolbarView, RulerWidget) to extend these new base
classes. Corresponding XML layouts were also updated to use
net.osmand.plus.widgets.FrameLayoutEx and
net.osmand.plus.widgets.LinearLayoutEx.

This change centralizes common view lifecycle observer logic,
reducing boilerplate and improving code maintainability.
