fix(ui): Restore list scroll position and refine search layouts

Fixes an issue where ListView scroll position was not correctly restored
after editing POI filters. Switched from 'scrollTo' to 'setSelectionFromTop'
to ensure accurate scroll restoration.

Refactors the button layout in 'search_address.xml' for better distribution
and alignment of 'SearchOnline', 'ShowOnMap', and 'NavigateTo' buttons.
Uses 'layout_weight' for horizontal distribution.

Includes minor margin adjustments in 'search_address_online.xml' and
XML formatting cleanup in 'search_address_offline.xml'.
