feat: Implement two-finger tap to zoom out map

Introduces a new SimpleTwoFingerTapDetector to handle two-finger gestures on the map.
Tapping with two fingers will now zoom out the map by one level, centered at the tap location.
Adds a flag to prevent onLongPress from being triggered immediately after a two-finger tap.
