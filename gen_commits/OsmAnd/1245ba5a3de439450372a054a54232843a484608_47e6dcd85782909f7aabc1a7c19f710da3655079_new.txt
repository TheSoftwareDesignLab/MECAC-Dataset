refactor: Improve layout of move marker bottom sheet (landscape)

Restructure the `move_marker_bottom_sheet` layout to optimize space usage in landscape mode.
The "Apply" and "Cancel" buttons are re-positioned directly within the root horizontal layout,
aligned vertically, and the text content now utilizes `layout_weight` to fill available space.
Updated the background attribute for consistency with other bottom menu views.
Removed redundant `tools:visibility="gone"` from the include.
