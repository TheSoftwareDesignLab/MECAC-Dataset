fix(android-auto): Streamline navigation start from preview

Removed redundant `onSearchResultSelected` call when starting navigation from
`RoutePreviewScreen`. Simplified `CarNavigationSession.startNavigation()`
by using a safe call operator and removing the `hasStarted()` check.
Includes minor formatting improvements.
