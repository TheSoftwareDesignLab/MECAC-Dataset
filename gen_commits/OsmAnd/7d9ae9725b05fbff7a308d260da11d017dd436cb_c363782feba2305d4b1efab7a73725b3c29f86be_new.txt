refactor(radius-ruler): Rename night mode vars and invert logic

Renamed internal keys and variables from `nightRadiusRuler` to `nightModeRadiusRuler` for clarity.
Inverted the boolean logic for the `nightModeRadiusRuler` variable. It now stores `true` when the "Light Theme" is selected and `false` when the "Dark Theme" is selected, effectively reversing the meaning of the `RADIUS_RULER_NIGHT_MODE` setting.
Updated `TextToggleButton` initialization and click listeners to reflect this inverted logic.
