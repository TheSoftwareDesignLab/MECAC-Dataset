feat: Add single tap to select marker in lists

If the 'SELECT_MARKER_ON_SINGLE_TAP' setting is enabled, a single tap on a map marker in the active or groups lists will now move that marker to the top of the list. This provides an alternative interaction flow, avoiding immediate navigation to the map.
