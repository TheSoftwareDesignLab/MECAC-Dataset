feat: Implement dynamic map localization based on zoom

Refactor map localization logic into MapVectorLayer, centralizing the determination
of preferred locale and transliteration preference. This enables dynamic updates
based on zoom levels, using the app's locale for overview maps when no specific
preferred locale is set.
