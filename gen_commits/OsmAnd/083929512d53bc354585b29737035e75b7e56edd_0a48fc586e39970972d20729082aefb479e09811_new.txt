style: Implement and use compact Material text input

Introduces `CompactInputLayoutStyle` based on `OutlinedBox.Dense` to provide a more compact text input field by disabling hints and reducing internal padding. This style is applied to the color picker's HEX input field, replacing the `FilledBox` style.
