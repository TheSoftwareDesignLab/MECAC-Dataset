feat: Categorize history entries by source

Introduces a `HistorySource` enum to distinguish between search and navigation history entries.
The `HistoryEntry` model is updated to store the source, and `SearchHistoryHelper` methods are refactored to accept this new parameter.
The database schema for history items is migrated to include the history source.
History retrieval methods are added to fetch search-specific or navigation-specific history.
All relevant call sites across the application have been updated to correctly assign the history source.
