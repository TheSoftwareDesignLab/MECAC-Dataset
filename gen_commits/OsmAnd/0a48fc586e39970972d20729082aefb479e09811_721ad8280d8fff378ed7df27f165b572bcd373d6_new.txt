feat: Improve UI scrolling and short click handling in context menus

Introduce `OnVisibilityChangeListener` and `OnNeedScrollUiAdapter` interfaces.
Add `isPointInsideView` and `addVisibilityChangeListener` to AndroidUtils.
Implement short click detection and `onShortClick` callback in ContextMenuFragment.
Enable automatic vertical scrolling to bring elements into view (e.g., Track Width slider).
TrackAppearanceFragment leverages these improvements for map adjustment and card scrolling.
