feat: Implement dedicated map animation for route previews

Introduces `animateToPreview` for controlled map animations, particularly for route and area previews. This method allows independent animation of target, zoom, elevation angle, and azimuth.

Refactors `OsmandMapTileView` to use `animateToPreview` when fitting a rectangle with rotation. Removes ad-hoc map state adjustments in Android Auto screens for a unified approach.
