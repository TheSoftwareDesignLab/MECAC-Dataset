feat: Revamp quick search dialog with tabbed UI

This commit significantly refactors the quick search dialog.
The main changes include:
- Replaced the single ListView with a tabbed interface using TabLayout and ViewPager.
- Introduced dedicated fragments for Main search results, Search History, and Categories.
- Enhanced search list item presentation to include amenity type icons and opening hours.
- Renamed SearchListAdapter and SearchListItem classes for clarity (QuickSearchListAdapter, QuickSearchListItem).
- Added new styling and theming attributes to support the new tab bar and search input fields.
