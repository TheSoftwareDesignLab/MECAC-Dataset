refactor: Prioritize widget's own visibility preference

The MapWidgetRegistry's `setVisibility` method now checks if a widget provides a specific visibility preference and toggles it directly. If no such preference exists, it falls back to mode-based visibility management.

The MapMarkersBarWidget has been updated to provide its `SHOW_MAP_MARKERS_BAR_WIDGET` preference. Removed redundant widget reset methods from MapWidgetRegistry.
