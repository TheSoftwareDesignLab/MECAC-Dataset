feat(mapcontextmenu): Enhance menu layout and collapse handling

- Increase half-screen menu height to 75%.
- Default to opening the menu in half-screen mode.
- Control zoom button visibility based on menu state (visible only when header is active).
- Introduce a global listener for collapsible sections to trigger full menu layout updates, preventing incorrect sizing after content changes.
- Refine full-screen menu positioning and slide-down gesture handling.
- Rename `OnCollExpListener` to `CollapseExpandListener` for clarity.
