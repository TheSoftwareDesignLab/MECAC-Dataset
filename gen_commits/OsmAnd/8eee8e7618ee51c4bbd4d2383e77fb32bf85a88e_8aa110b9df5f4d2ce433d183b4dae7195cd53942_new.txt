refactor: Standardize menu icons and list item layout

Renamed `list_view_*.png` and other specific icons to `list_activities_*.png`
for better consistency. Introduced `list_menu_item.xml` as a standardized
layout for menu items and updated relevant UI code to use these new assets.
Also added compound drawable padding for improved visual alignment.
