refactor: Nest AddMarkersGroupFragmentListener for improved encapsulation

Moved the `AddMarkersGroupFragmentListener` interface inside `AddMarkersGroupBottomSheetDialogFragment` to improve encapsulation. This clarifies the interface's scope.

Additionally, wired the `favouritesOnClick` callback to call a new `openAddFavouritesGroupMenu()` method, laying the groundwork for future functionality to add marker groups based on favourites.
