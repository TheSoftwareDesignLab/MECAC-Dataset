feat: Integrate GPS filter with Measurement Tool

Allows users to apply GPS filters to tracks created or edited within the Measurement Tool.

- A new "GPS Filter" option is available in the Measurement Tool's options menu for plain tracks.
- The current measurement data is passed to the GpsFilterFragment.
- Upon saving a filtered track, it replaces the original track in the Measurement Tool.
- The Measurement Tool layer drawing is paused while the GpsFilterFragment is active.
- Improved handling of disabled filters and track saving paths within the filter helper.
