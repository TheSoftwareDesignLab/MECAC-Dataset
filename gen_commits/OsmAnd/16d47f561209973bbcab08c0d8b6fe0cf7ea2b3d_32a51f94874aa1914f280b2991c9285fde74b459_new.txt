feat: Add specific warning for key already assigned to same action

Introduces a dedicated warning message when a user attempts to assign a key
that is already configured for the current action. Previously, a warning
only appeared if the key was assigned to a *different* action.

This new warning:
- Uses the string "This button is already assigned to this action."
- Appears without a warning icon, distinguishing it from conflicts.
- Only displays after the user provides input, tracked by a new `hasInputFromUser` flag.

Adds `warning_icon` ID to the layout for explicit control of the icon's visibility.
