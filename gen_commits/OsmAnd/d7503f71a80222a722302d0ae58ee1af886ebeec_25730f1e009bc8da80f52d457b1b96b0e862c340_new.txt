feat: Enhance double-tap zoom interaction and indicator

Refactors the double-tap zoom gesture to use screen-relative scaling, providing a more consistent zoom experience across devices.

- Introduces a new visual indicator (crosshair) drawn at the double-tap gesture center during zoom.
- Prevents other gesture detectors from interfering when double-tap zoom is active.
- Updates `DoubleTapScaleDetector` to require an `Activity` context.
