feat: Enhance app data move/copy flow with detailed results

Refactors the user experience when changing the application data directory.
Changes include:
- Renamed "Copy maps" action to "Move maps" to better reflect the intent.
- Introduced "Don't move" and "Cancel" buttons for clearer user choices.
- Implemented a detailed results dialog showing counts and sizes of moved,
  copied, and failed files after the operation completes.
- Offers a restart option from the results dialog.
