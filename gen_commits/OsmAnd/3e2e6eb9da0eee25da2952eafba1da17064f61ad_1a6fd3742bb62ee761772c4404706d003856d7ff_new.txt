feat(coordinates): Improve RTL support and layout mirroring

Ensure proper display of coordinate values in RTL layouts.
The numerical coordinate strings are now explicitly marked LTR using Unicode
bidirectional control characters to prevent misinterpretation of numbers
and symbols in RTL contexts.
The coordinate widget's layout (e.g., order of latitude/longitude, icon
placement) is dynamically mirrored to adapt to RTL display direction,
enhancing usability for RTL language users.
The `android:textDirection="ltr"` attribute has been removed from XML
as text direction is now handled programmatically.
