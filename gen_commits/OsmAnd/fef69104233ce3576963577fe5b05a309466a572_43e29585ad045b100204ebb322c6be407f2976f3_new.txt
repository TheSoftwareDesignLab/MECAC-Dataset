feat: Support elevation metrics from GPX extension tags

Introduces the ability to parse and display pre-calculated elevation metrics
(min/max/avg elevation, total uphill/downhill gain) stored in GPX file
extension tags.

This enhances `GpxTrackAnalysis` to recognize these metrics and makes them
available for display in various UI components, including:
- Map context menu for track amenities
- Quick search results for tracks
- GPX track statistics blocks

Refactored elevation-related constants for consistency and updated OBF
file handling to persist these new metrics.

Also, improved location update logic in `QuickSearchDialogFragment` to
reduce unnecessary UI refreshes based on minor bearing changes.
