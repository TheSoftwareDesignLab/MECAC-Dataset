feat: Remember global track interval per profile

Introduce OnApplyChanges interface to notify fragments of preference updates.
Use this interface in MonitoringSettingsFragment to set SAVE_GLOBAL_TRACK_REMEMBER
flag to true when the user explicitly changes the 'Save global track interval' preference.
This ensures the chosen interval is correctly loaded and remembered for each
application profile.
Mark save_global_track_interval preference as non-persistent in XML,
as its value is now programmatically managed based on the remember flag.
