feat: Auto-open points tab after adding new GPX waypoint

When adding a new GPX waypoint via the map context menu, the associated
TrackActivity will now automatically navigate to and display the "Points" tab.
This provides a more seamless user experience by immediately showing the newly
created point within the track's waypoint list.

A new flag `newGpxPointProcessing` is introduced in the waypoint editor to
distinguish this specific flow and customize the editor's toolbar title to
"Save GPX Waypoint". The OnDismissListener interface was also refactored.
