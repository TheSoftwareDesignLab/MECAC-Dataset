fix(coord-input): Dynamically set toolbar title color based on theme

The title text color for the coordinate input dialog's toolbar is now
dynamically set in code. This ensures proper visibility and theming
consistency across light and dark modes, resolving potential issues
where the text color might not adapt correctly. The `android:textColor`
attribute in XML was replaced with `tools:textColor` to reflect this
runtime control.
