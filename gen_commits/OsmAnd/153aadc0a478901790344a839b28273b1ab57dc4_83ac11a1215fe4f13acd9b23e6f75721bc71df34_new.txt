fix: Allow gesture detector during non-scaling double-tap

Previously, `gestureDetector` was blocked during a double-tap sequence (`isDoubleTapping` true) even if no active zoom (`isInZoomMode` false) was occurring. This change allows `gestureDetector` to process events in such scenarios, preventing accidental blocking of other gestures when a double-tap doesn't lead to active scaling.
