- Introduces a dedicated navigation bar scrim for consistent system bar coloring.
- Centralizes status and navigation bar coloring logic within OsmandActionBarActivity and AndroidUiHelper, leveraging scrims.
- Adjusts status bar padding to only apply when Edge-to-Edge is not supported.
- Standardizes InsetsUtils interfaces to use Set<InsetSide> for increased flexibility.
- Refactors logcat_activity.xml to use a common recyclerview include.
