feat: Add `usedOnMap` parameter for contextual card rendering

Introduces a `usedOnMap` boolean parameter to `onBindCardContent` and relevant card constructors. This allows card controllers and cards to adjust their behavior and appearance based on whether they are displayed directly on the map or within configuration screens/dialogs.

- Propagates `usedOnMap` through `IMultiStateCardController`, `MultiStateCard`, `BaseCard`, and `IconsPaletteCard`.
- Ensures map buttons displayed in configuration cards are non-interactive by clearing their touch/click listeners.
- Updates `map_button_background_color_dark` in `colors.xml` from transparent white to black for improved visibility in dark mode.
