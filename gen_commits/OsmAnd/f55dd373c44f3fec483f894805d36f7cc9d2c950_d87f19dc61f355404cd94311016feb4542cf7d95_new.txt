feat: Add dynamic routing mode and improve route region bounds

This enables users to select routing profiles (car, bicycle, pedestrian)
from application preferences. The `MapRouterLayer` now dynamically
initializes the appropriate `VehicleRouter` based on the chosen mode.

Further improvements include:
- Displaying exact latitude/longitude bounds for route regions in BinaryInspector.
- Adding an `estimatedDistance` field to `RoutingContext` for initial
  route planning setup.
