refactor: Move map touch detector lifecycle to MapViewWithLayers

Touch detectors (gesture, multi-touch, double-tap, two-finger) are now initialized in `MapViewWithLayers` constructor and cleared in `onDestroy`. This decouples their lifecycle from `OsmandMapTileView.setMapActivity()`. The `DoubleTapScaleDetector` now receives `Context` directly, eliminating `OsmandMapTileView.getUiContext()`.
