chore: Refactor BackupCloudFragment and hide action icons

Refactor `BackupCloudFragment` by declaring `WarningStatusCard` and `IntroductionCard` as local variables within `setupCards` to reduce their scope.
Explicitly hide the second icon for download and upload actions in `ChangeItemActionsBottomSheet`.
