style: Update dashboard text colors and sizes

Introduces new `dashboard_black` and `dashboard_blue` color resources.
Applies these new colors and adjusted text sizes to elements in the dashboard
favorites list and general dashboard buttons via XML styles.
Removes programmatic `ForegroundColorSpan` for distance text, as styling
is now handled directly in the layout XML.
