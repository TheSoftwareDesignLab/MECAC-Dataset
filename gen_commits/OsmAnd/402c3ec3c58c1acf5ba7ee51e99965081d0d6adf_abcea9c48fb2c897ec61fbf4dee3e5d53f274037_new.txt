refactor: Remove notifyListener param from animatingMapAnimator

The `notifyListener` parameter and the related `animateTarget` logic have been extracted from `animatingMapAnimator`. This logic is now explicitly handled in `startDragging` where it is required, making `animatingMapAnimator` more focused and generic. This change does not alter the overall animation behavior.
