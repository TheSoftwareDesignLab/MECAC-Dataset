refactor(shared): Move track filter logic to common module

Migrate track filtering core logic and data structures to `OsmAnd-shared` (Kotlin Multiplatform).
Introduce common types: `KWidthMode`, `KStringMatcher`, `StringIntegerPair`, `KInteger`.
Centralize filter creation with `TrackFiltersHelper` and refactor `DateTrackFilter` to use epoch milliseconds for internal state.
Update Android module to consume shared filter types and provide platform-specific implementations for interfaces like `KStringMatcher` via `OsmAndContext`.
Remove redundant filter helper and adapter classes from platform-specific modules, adjusting remaining UI adapters for the new shared structure.
