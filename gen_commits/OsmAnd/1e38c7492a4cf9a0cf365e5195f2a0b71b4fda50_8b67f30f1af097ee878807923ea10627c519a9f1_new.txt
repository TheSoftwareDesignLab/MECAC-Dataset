feat: Add `usedOnMap` flag to SharedStorageWarningBottomSheet

Introduces a `usedOnMap` boolean parameter to `SharedStorageWarningBottomSheet.showInstance`
to indicate whether the dialog was triggered from a map-related context.
This allows the dialog to adapt its behavior or content based on its origin.
