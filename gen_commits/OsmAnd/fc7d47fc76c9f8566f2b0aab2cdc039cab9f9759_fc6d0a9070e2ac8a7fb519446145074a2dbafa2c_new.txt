refactor: Extract map widget creation logic into new classes

Introduces `WidgetInfoCreator` to handle the creation of `MapWidgetInfo` objects, centralizing logic for widget panels, pages, and order.
A new `WidgetsInitializer` class now manages the creation of all default, plugin, AIDL, and custom map widgets, replacing the previous `createAllControls` method in `MapWidgetRegistry`.
This refactoring improves modularity and maintainability by separating concerns.
`WidgetType.getGroup()` also now conditionally determines widget group availability, e.g., altitude widgets based on plugin settings.
