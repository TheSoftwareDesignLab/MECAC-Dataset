feat: Allow waiting for views within specific Espresso roots

Enhance `waitForAnyView` utility to accept an optional `RootMatcher`.
This enables waiting for views specifically within popups, dialogs, or other windows, making test assertions more robust.
Updated `EditPoiTypeSuggestionsTest` to utilize this for verifying text in platform popups.
