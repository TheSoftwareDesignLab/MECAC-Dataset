fix: Use correct active app mode and collapse online photos by default

Corrected the retrieval of the active application mode in `MapRouteInfoMenu` to use `getRoutingHelper().getAppMode()`.
Set the default state for the "Online Photos" row (Mapillary menu) to be collapsed.
Refactored `MapRouteInfoMenu` to use a local `OsmandApplication` variable for clarity and efficiency.
