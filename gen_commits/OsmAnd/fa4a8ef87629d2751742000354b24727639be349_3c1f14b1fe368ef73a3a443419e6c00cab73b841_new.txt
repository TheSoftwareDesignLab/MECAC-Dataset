refactor: Streamline bottom sheet cancel button and content management

Removed bottom_sheet_item_cancel.xml by inlining its content into bottom_sheet_menu_base.xml for simplified layout.

AddGroupBottomSheetDialogFragment now integrates its custom content as a BaseBottomSheetItem into MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment's item list, removing redundant cancel button definitions and aligning its structure with the parent's item management.

Added onDestroyView cleanup in MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment to prevent memory leaks.
