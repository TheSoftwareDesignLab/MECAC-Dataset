feat: Improve measurement tool points list display in landscape

Introduce a dedicated landscape layout for the measurement tool fragment.
Display the list of measurement points in a separate `PointsListFragment`
when the device is in landscape orientation. This optimizes screen space
usage and improves usability compared to the in-place expanding list used
in portrait mode.
