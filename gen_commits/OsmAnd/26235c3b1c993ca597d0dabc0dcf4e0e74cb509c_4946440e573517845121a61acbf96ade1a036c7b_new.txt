feat(travelcards): Add contextual toast messages for card actions

Replaces generic placeholder toast messages with specific, context-aware messages when primary or secondary buttons are clicked on the travel download/update card.
- Primary button now shows "Download" or "Update".
- Secondary button now shows "Cancel" (if loading) or "Later".
