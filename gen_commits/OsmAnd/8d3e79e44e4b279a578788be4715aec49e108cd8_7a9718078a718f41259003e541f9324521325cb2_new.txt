feat: Justify search results and prioritize by matched words

Implements a new mechanism to refine search results by performing sub-searches for "unknown" words in the phrase.
Search results are now prioritized based on the count of matched "unknown" words (`foundWordCount`).
Introduces `parentSearchResult` to link refined results to their original matches.
Updates search phrase parsing to better handle delimiters and identify unknown words.
