feat: Enhance profile icon and color selection UI

Redesigned the profile editing screen to provide a more organized
and visually appealing interface for selecting both the profile icon
and its associated color.

This change:
- Replaces the previous simple icon button with distinct sections
  for choosing the icon and the icon color.
- Introduces new UI elements for color selection.
- Updates layout IDs and view bindings in `EditProfileFragment`.
- Adds a new string resource for "Icon".
- Applies a themed divider to `profile_list_item.xml`.
