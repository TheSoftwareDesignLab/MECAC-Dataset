feat(routing-memory): Add setting for allocated routing memory

Introduces a new development setting to adjust the memory allocated
for routing calculations. A dedicated bottom sheet with a slider
allows users to modify this value, with the available range
dynamically determined by device memory. This aims to improve
calculation speed for long routes.
