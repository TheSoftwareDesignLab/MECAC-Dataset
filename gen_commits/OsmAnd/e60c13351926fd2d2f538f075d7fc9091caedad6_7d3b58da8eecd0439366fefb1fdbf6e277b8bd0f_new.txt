fix(poi): Improve opening hours editor and resolve UI scroll bug

- Fixes NestedScrollView cutting off content in POI editor by adding
  a 500dp Space workaround to fragment_edit_poi_advanced.xml and
  fragment_edit_poi_normal.xml.
- Enhances opening hours editor functionality:
    - Parses existing 'opening_hours' tag values to pre-fill the editor UI.
    - Sets sensible default times (8:00 for start, 20:00 for end) in the
      opening hours rule dialog.
    - Dynamically loads and sets clock and delete icons for individual
      opening hour items.
    - Refactors tag processing in NormalDataFragment using a new TagFilter
      interface and specific filters.
    - Uses 'toStringNoMoths()' for saving 'opening_hours' tags, simplifying
      the output when changes originate from user input.
