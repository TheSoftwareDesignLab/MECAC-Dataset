refactor: Improve POI editing UI theming and back press handling

Convert EditPoiFragment to a DialogFragment for better presentation.
Implement OnBackPressedProvider and OnBackPressedListener to allow fragments
to intercept the system back button, used by EditPoiFragment to prompt
about unsaved changes.
Refactor POI editing layouts to use theme attributes (?attr/) for colors
and styles, enhancing overall theme support including dark mode.
Standardize button heights and text colors for consistency.
