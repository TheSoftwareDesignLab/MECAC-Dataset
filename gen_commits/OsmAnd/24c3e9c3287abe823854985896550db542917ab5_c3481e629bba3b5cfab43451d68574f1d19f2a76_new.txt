feat: Improve auto-zoom, route animation, and add lane data parsing

Refactor auto-zoom logic to maintain a consistent look-ahead distance based on speed and utilize fractional zoom.
Enhance route animation for GPX tracks by utilizing timestamps and improving speed/bearing calculations.
Introduce parsing and handling of 'lanes' data from binary OSM maps.
Adapt UI zoom controls and map tile rendering to work with fractional zoom levels.
Refactor location projection during routing for improved accuracy.
Move `LatLonUtils` methods directly into `RouteAnimation` to consolidate utilities.
Add "Shared location" string and update map intent parsing to use it.
