security: Restrict access to core services

Introduces `net.osmand.SERVICE_PERMISSION` with `signature` protection.
This permission is applied to `NavigationService` and `DownloadService` to
ensure that only applications signed with the same certificate as OsmAnd
can interact with these services.

This enhances security by preventing unauthorized access from external apps.
The intent filter for `NavigationService` was removed accordingly.
