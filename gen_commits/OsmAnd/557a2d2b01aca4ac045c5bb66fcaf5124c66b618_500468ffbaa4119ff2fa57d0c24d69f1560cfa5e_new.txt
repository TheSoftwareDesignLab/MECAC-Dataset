feat: Enhance warning icons with multi-density support

Adds new `mdpi`, `xhdpi`, and `xxhdpi` assets for pedestrian, railway, and
traffic calming warning icons. Updates existing `hdpi` versions for these
icons. This improves visual quality and clarity of warning indicators across
various screen densities.
