fix: Use device density for rendering calculations

Replaced `tileBox.getMapDensity()` with `tileBox.getDensity()` in `OsmandMapLayer.java`. This ensures the device's screen density is consistently used for rendering context scaling and when calculating the rendering properties hash, preventing potential scaling issues.
