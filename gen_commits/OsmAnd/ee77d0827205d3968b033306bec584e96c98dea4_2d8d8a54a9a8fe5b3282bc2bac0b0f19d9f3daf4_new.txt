feat: Add dedicated settings screen for Coordinates Grid

Implemented a new UI and controller to manage the coordinate grid settings. Users can now enable/disable the grid, select display format (DMS, DM, Digital, UTM), and set min/max zoom levels. Grid format and zoom preferences were moved to core OsmandSettings.
