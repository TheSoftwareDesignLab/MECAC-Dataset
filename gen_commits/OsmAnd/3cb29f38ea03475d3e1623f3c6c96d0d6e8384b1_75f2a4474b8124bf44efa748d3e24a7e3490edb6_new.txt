refactor: Extract Street Name & Waypoint widget to separate component

Extracted the street name and waypoint information UI into a dedicated `street_name_widget.xml` layout file and a new `StreetNameWidget` class. This improves modularity by encapsulating the display logic for street names, turn icons, road shields, exit references, and waypoint details. Updated `MapInfoLayer` and `MapActivity` to integrate the new component and removed the obsolete `TopTextView` class.
