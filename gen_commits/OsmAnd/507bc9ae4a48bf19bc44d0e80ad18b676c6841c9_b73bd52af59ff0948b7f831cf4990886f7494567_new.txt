feat: Reduce multi-profile geometry path and icon sizes

Reduces the path width for multi-profile geometries from 10dp to 4dp.
Significantly shrinks the profile icons frame size from 70dp to 18dp
and the internal icon size from a calculated value to a fixed 12dp.
This change aims to make the geometry display less intrusive on the map.
Adjusted the straight line color for improved contrast and consistency.
