feat: Improve vertical widget styling and update logic

Introduced `bs_vertical_widget_night.xml` for vertical widget backgrounds in night mode, enabling proper pressed states.
Updated `MapInfoLayer` to use this new drawable.
Refactored `RouteInfoWidget` update logic with a `forceUpdate` flag to ensure a complete refresh when the view is recreated.
Applied minor layout adjustments to `widget_route_information_large.xml` and refactored `Algorithms.formatMinutesDuration`.
