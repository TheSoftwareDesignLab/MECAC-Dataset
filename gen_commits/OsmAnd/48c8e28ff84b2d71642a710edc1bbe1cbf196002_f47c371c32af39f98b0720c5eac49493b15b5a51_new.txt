refactor: Remove MainMenuActivity and standardize button attributes

The `MainMenuActivity` class has been fully removed, including its manifest declaration and all internal references.
Updated button background attribute from `options_button_background` to `dashboard_button` across several layout files for consistency.
Encapsulated `isAmazonEnabled` and `isGooglePlayEnabled` methods by making them private in `Version.java`.
