fix: Prevent fragment stacking during navigation

Dismiss the current fragment when navigating to a target fragment that is
already present in the fragment manager. This avoids creating duplicate
fragment instances (e.g., ChoosePlanFragment, PurchasesFragment) and
improves back stack management.

Also, update ChoosePlanFragment to use `AndroidUtils.isFragmentCanBeAdded`
for more robust fragment transaction checks.
