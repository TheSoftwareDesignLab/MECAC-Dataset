feat(ru): Add GPX privacy strings and enhance translations

Added new string keys for GPX upload privacy settings (Public, Identifiable, Trackable, Private).
Corrected grammar, phrasing, and terminology in existing strings, notably for the 0.8.0 release tips.
Translated "Changes in 0.8.1 :" and removed a superfluous hyphen from "Map settings".
