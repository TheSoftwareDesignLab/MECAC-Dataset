refactor: Unify track rendering culling and refine arrow visuals

- Centralized asynchronous culler initialization logic in `RenderableSegment`.
- Standardized `segmentSize` parameter handling across track renderers.
- Reduced `segmentSize` for Conveyor and Arrows for increased density.
- Updated arrow drawing logic, including fixed arrow size and adjusted fade-out.
