style: Align text content to the right in menu layouts

Adds `android:gravity="right"` to the `TextVersion` TextView and various action `TextViews` (search, settings) across all `menu.xml` configurations. This change ensures their text content is consistently right-aligned within their view bounds, improving menu readability and visual presentation.
