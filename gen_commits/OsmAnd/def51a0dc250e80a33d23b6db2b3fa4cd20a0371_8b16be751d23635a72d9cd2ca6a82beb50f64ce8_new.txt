feat: Introduce Quick Actions on map screen

Implements a new quick actions widget and a toggle button directly on the map HUD.
The QuickActionsWidget is positioned at the top of the bottom HUD, controlled by a new button near the zoom controls.
A dedicated MapQuickActionLayer manages the widget's visibility and action population.
Layouts are adjusted to accommodate the new elements, including animated layout changes and improved touch feedback for quick action items.
