fix: Improve map context menu interaction through shadow overlay

Previously, tapping on the shadow view surrounding the map context menu would immediately dismiss it. This prevented users from interacting with map objects or context markers that might be visible through the shadow.

This change introduces a `GestureDetector` on the shadow view to first check if the `ContextMenuLayer` can handle the tap event (e.g., if it hits a context marker or an object that opens a new menu). The menu is now only dismissed if the tap does not interact with these elements.

Additionally, `ContextMenuLayer.onSingleTap` now correctly returns `true` when a single object is selected, indicating the event has been consumed.
