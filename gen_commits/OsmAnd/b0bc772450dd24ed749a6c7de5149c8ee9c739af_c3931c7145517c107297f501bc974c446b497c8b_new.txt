refactor: Adjust map markers and ruler text sizes for clarity

Reduce map marker text size from 14 to 12.
Increase ruler control vertical offset from 10 to 15.
Introduce distinct text sizes for ruler elements: circle labels remain 14, while distance line labels are increased to 16, improving readability hierarchy.
Refactor text size handling in RulerControlLayer with dedicated variables.
