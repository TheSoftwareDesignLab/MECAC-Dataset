feat: Redesign 'My Location' tab UI

Refactored the `fragment_my_location_tab.xml` layout to implement a modern UI using `CoordinatorLayout`, `AppBarLayout`, and `NestedScrollView`.

This change introduces:
- A prominent image and informational text for starting location sharing.
- An integrated search bar for groups or contacts, including new search icon drawables.
- New dimension and string resources to support the updated layout elements.
