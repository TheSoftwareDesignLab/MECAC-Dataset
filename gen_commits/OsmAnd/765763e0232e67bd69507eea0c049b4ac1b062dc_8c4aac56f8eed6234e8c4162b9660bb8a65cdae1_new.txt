refactor: Centralize coordinate row in context menu

Moved the logic for displaying the coordinates row to the base MenuBuilder.
This centralizes the display of location information, ensuring consistency
and removing duplicated code from various MenuBuilder subclasses and
MenuControllers that previously handled it individually.
