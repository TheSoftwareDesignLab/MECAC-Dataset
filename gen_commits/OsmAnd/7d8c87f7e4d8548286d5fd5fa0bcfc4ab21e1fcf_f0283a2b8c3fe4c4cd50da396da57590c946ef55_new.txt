fix: Correct 'Distance to first intermediate' toggle behavior

The toggle for "Display distance to first intermediate" in Android Auto
settings was previously inverted, showing the opposite state and setting
the wrong preference. This commit fixes the logic to correctly reflect
and control the setting.

Additionally:
- A descriptive summary text is added to the setting.
- OsmandSettings instance is cached in TripHelper for cleaner access.
