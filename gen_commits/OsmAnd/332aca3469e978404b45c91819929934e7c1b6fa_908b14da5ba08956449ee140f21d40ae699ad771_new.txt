feat: Add monitoring services widget to map

- Introduced a new map info widget for "Monitoring services".
- Updated the parking widget icon to `widget_parking.png`.
- Applied minor UI improvements to the layers list checkboxes,
  including wrapping the checkbox in a LinearLayout for better alignment
  and changing visibility of non-selectable items from INVISIBLE to GONE.
