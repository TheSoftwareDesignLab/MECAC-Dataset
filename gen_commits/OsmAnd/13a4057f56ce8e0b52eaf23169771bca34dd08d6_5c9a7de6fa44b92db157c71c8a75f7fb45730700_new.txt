refactor(render): Simplify high-contrast road attributes

Remove `color_2`, `strokeWidth_2`, and `cap_2` attributes from high-contrast road definitions. This streamlines rendering configuration and facilitates easier color customization.
Adjust bridge rendering to use `color_0`, `cap_0`, and `strokeWidth_0` for the base layer.
