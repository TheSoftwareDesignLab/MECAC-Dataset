feat: Improve search view styling and group dialog title

Introduces `FavoritesActivity.updateSearchView` to consistently style SearchView elements (icons, text color) based on the light content theme, applied in `AvailableGPXFragment`. Adds "Edit group" string and sets it as the title for the edit group dialog.
