fix: Enhance nested scrolling for TrackSegmentFragment UI

Introduces a utility method to properly size ListViews when nested inside a ScrollView, ensuring all items are visible without inner scrolling.
Implements more robust touch event interception logic for both ListView and charts. This prevents the parent ScrollView from conflicting with child scroll/touch actions, allowing for smooth and correct interaction with these elements.
