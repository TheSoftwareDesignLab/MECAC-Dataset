fix: Initialize Toast on UI thread to prevent exceptions

Calling `new Toast(this)` in the application's onCreate method ensures that
the Toast system is initialized on the main UI thread. This prevents
potential RuntimeExceptions that can occur if the first Toast creation
happens on a non-UI thread.
