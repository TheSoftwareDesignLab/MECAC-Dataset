fix: Improve window insets and edge-to-edge UI adaptation

*   Updated `InsetsUtils.MINIMUM_EDGE_TO_EDGE_SUPPORTED_API` to 35 for better edge-to-edge support.
*   Ensured consistent navigation bar contrast by calling `setNavigationBarContrastEnforced(false)` for dialogs.
*   Enhanced `InsetsUtils.applyPadding` to allow granular control over applied inset types (system bars, display cutout, IME).
*   Added specific `InsetTarget` rules for several fragments (Explore Places, Edit POI, Configure Map/Widgets, Search Custom POI) to prevent UI elements from being obscured by system bars or the soft keyboard.
*   Refined landscape translation for the Explore Places fragment to correctly account for left system insets.
