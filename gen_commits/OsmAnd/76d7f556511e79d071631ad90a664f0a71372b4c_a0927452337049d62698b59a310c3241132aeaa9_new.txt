refactor: Improve voice download and selection in settings

- Extracted `isVoiceTTS` and `isRecordedVoice` methods to `IndexItem` for clearer voice type checks.
- Refactored `VoiceLanguageBottomSheetFragment` to streamline voice item click handling, especially for TTS voices.
- Introduced new helper methods to improve code readability and maintainability in voice settings.
- Added `@NonNull` annotations to `FragmentActivity` parameters in `DownloadValidationManager` for null safety.
- Added `main_container` ID to `list_item_icon_and_download.xml` for UI control.
