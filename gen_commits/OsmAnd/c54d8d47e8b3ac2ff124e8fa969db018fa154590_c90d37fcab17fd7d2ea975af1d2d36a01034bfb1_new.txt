fix: Use HTTPS for base short OSM URL

Updated the base short OSM URL to use HTTPS, enhancing security.
The hostname was changed from `osm.org` to `openstreetmap.org` to ensure
HTTPS functionality, as `osm.org` currently lacks HTTPS support.
A TODO comment is added to revert the hostname once `osm.org` supports HTTPS.
