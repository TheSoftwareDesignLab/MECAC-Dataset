refactor: Consolidate startedMode reset in MultiTouchSupport

The `startedMode` variable is now reset to `MODE.NONE` in a single
consolidated block for both `ACTION_UP` and `ACTION_CANCEL` events.
This removes redundant code and ensures consistent state management
at the end of multi-touch gestures.
