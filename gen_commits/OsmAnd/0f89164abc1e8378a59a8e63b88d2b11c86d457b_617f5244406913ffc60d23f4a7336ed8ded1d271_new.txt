feat: Improve weather source change handling and ECMWF compatibility

Introduced a `WeatherSourceChangeListener` to allow various weather components to react dynamically to changes in the selected weather data source.

- Weather raster layers now reset and recreate their providers.
- The forecast fragment updates its widgets.
- Weather contour and layer buttons now disable wind and cloud-related options when the ECMWF source is selected, as it does not provide this data.
- Weather widgets reload data when the source changes.
