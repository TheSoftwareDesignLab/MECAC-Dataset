refactor: Separate UI and search radii for transport stops

Distinguish display radius (SHOW_STOPS_RADIUS_METERS_UI) from internal search radius
(SHOW_STOPS_RADIUS_METERS) for transport stops.
Introduce MAX_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_AMENITY_AND_LOCAL_STOPS to improve accuracy
when linking an amenity to its closest transport stop.
