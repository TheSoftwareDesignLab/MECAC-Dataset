feat: Enhance multi-part address and POI search chaining

Removed the complex `justifySearchResults` method from `SearchUICore`.
Introduced `subSearchApiOrPublish` in `SearchCoreFactory.SearchBaseAPI` to provide a more structured and explicit mechanism for chaining searches.
Refactored `SearchAddressByNameAPI` and `SearchStreetByCityAPI` to utilize this new chaining logic, enabling more precise multi-part address and street searches (e.g., city -> street -> building).
Replaced `SearchResult.foundWordCount` with a computed `getFoundWordCount()` based on a new `otherWordsMatch` collection. This allows explicit tracking of which unknown words match a specific result, improving accuracy in subsequent chained searches.
Updated `SearchPhrase.countUnknownWordsMatch` to populate `otherWordsMatch` directly.
