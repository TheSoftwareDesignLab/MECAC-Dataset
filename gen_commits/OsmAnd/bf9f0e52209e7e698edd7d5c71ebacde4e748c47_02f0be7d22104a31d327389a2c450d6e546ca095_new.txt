feat: Store amenity names in dedicated fields

The `setAdditionalInfo` method now specifically handles 'name' and 'name:en' tags.
Instead of adding them to the generic `additionalInfo` map, these tags are used
to populate the Amenity object's dedicated 'name' and 'enName' fields,
improving data consistency and direct access to amenity names.
