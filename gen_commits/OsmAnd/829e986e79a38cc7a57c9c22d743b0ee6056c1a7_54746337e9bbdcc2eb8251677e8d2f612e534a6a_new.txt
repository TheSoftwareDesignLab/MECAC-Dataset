feat: Enhance Favourites bottom sheet for better UX and sorting

- Introduce a dedicated `favourites_recycleview.xml` layout for the Favourites list.
- Apply correct theme (light/dark) when inflating the RecyclerView.
- Improve sorting logic, preventing issues when current location is unavailable.
- Scroll to the top of the list automatically after sorting.
- Adjust icon margins in `favourite_list_item.xml` for consistent spacing.
