feat: Support configurable text size in MapTextLayer

The MapTextLayer now dynamically adjusts its text size based on the
TEXT_SCALE application setting. This enables users to configure the
size of map labels, improving readability. The `updateTextSize()`
method centralizes the text size calculation and is called during
layer initialization and before rendering text objects.
