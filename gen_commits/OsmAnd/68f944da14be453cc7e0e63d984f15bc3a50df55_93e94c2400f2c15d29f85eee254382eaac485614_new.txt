feat: Make OSM Notes min zoom configurable

Introduced a new `SHOW_OSM_BUGS_MIN_ZOOM` preference to allow users to customize the minimum zoom level for displaying OSM Notes.
The previously hardcoded `startZoom` in `OsmBugsLayer` now reads this preference.
Added a dedicated option in the OSM Notes context menu to select the desired zoom level, ranging from 8 to 16, with 8 as the default.
