refactor: Improve route progress calculation and HUD layout

Refine route calculation progress logic:
- Corrected typo from INITIAL_PROGRSS to INITIAL_PROGRESS.
- Adjusted total estimated distance multiplier (1.25f to 1.35f).
- Clamped intermediate progress value to ensure it does not exceed 1.
- Refined iteration condition (`<= 0` to `< 1`).

Repositioned the map_horizontal_progress bar within map_hud_bottom layouts (portrait and landscape) for correct display.
