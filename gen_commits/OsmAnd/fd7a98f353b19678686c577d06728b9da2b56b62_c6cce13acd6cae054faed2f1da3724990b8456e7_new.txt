refactor: Centralize rendering rule property value handling

OsmandSettings.getRenderPropertyValue now takes RenderingRuleProperty and ensures a valid value (or default) is returned.
Introduced AndroidUtils.getRenderPropertySelectedValueIndex for determining the selected index of a property in UI dialogs.
Added AndroidUtils.getRenderingStringPropertyValue to retrieve and format the display string for a rendering property.
Refactored various UI and map components to use these new centralized methods, reducing code duplication and improving consistency and robustness in property management.
