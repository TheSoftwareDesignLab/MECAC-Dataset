perf: Optimize location marker rendering and heading updates

Refactor location marker update logic to consistently trigger on location changes via `runMarkerInvalidation`.
Introduce `hasHeading` and `hasHeadingCached` to efficiently manage heading icon visibility.
Invalidate markers only when heading state changes or during explicit initialization/updates.
Consolidate renderer setup into `initRenderer()`.
Replace magic number with `MIN_ZOOM_MARKER_VISIBILITY` for marker visibility.
