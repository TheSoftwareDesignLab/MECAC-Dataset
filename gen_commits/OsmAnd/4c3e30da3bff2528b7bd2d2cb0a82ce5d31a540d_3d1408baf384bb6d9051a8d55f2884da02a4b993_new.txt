fix: Correctly center location marker when map is linked

Ensure the location marker is drawn at the screen's center when the map is tracking the user's position, preventing it from appearing off-center.

Refactor map animation:
- Rename `startMovingNav` to `startMoving` and generalize its usage.
- Add `notifyListener` parameter to control listener invocation during animation steps.
- Skip animation if the target location is outside the current view, improving responsiveness for large jumps.
