refactor(dev-plugin): Improve load average info readability

Updated the 'load_avg_info' string to "Engine statistics" for better clarity.
Changed the display format of FPS, GPU, CPU, and Battery values from
space-separated to slash-separated (e.g., "X / Y / Z") to enhance
readability for the 1 / 5 / 15 minute averages.
