refactor: Pass specific Context to UI utility methods

Updated calls to UiUtilities.getInflater and UiUtilities.getThemedContext to use a more specific Context (e.g., Activity or Fragment context) instead of the global OsmandApplication instance. This improves context management and adheres to Android best practices for UI-related operations. The OsmandApplication is now explicitly retrieved from the provided Context where needed. Also improved null-safety with @NonNull annotations.
