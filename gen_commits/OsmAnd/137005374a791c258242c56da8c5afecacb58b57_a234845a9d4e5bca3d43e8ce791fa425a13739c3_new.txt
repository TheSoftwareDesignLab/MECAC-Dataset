refactor(ui): Unify and standardize theme attributes and colors

This commit refactors the application's UI theming system for improved consistency and maintainability.
- Replaces numerous direct color and drawable references with new, semantic theme attributes like `card_and_list_background_basic`, `divider_color_basic`, `main_font_color_basic`, and `active_color_basic`.
- Introduces `bg_map_route_menu_dark.xml` and `bg_map_route_menu_light.xml` for consistent route menu backgrounds.
- Updates various layouts and Java files to leverage the new theming variables, ensuring a more cohesive appearance across dark and light modes.
