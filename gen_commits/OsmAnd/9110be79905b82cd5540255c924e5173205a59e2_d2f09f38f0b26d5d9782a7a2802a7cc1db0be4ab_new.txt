style: Apply primary text color and ellipsis to list labels

Ensures list item labels (favourites, search history) and generic list text views
use the theme's primary text color for consistent theming. Text truncation
with ellipsis is added to favourite and search history labels to prevent
text overflow on a single line. Includes design-time `tools:text` attributes
for improved layout previewing.
