fix: Smooth map following animation with dynamic duration

The map following animation now dynamically adjusts its duration based on the
time elapsed between location updates. This prevents jerky movements
and ensures smoother transitions, especially when location updates are infrequent.

Additionally, the interpolator for 3D map movement has been changed
from accelerate/decelerate to linear for consistent animation speed.
