feat: Filter map styles and routing profiles from inactive plugins

This commit clarifies plugin status retrieval by implicitly replacing `getDisabledPlugins()` with `getNotEnabledPlugins()`.
It ensures that map styles and routing profiles belonging to plugins that are not enabled are no longer presented in the UI, improving user experience by hiding unavailable options.
