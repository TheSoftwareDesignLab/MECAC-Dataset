feat: Enhance live location sharing with detailed data and flexible bot messages

Add support for sending bearing, speed, altitude, and accuracy to the OsmAnd Live server for device sharing.
Introduce configurable bot message types (map, text, or both) for live location sharing, allowing users to choose the preferred display format.
Enrich text-based live location messages with a clickable URL (osmand.net/go) and display detailed sensor information like altitude, speed, and horizontal precision.
Improve parsing of incoming text location messages to correctly extract data from the new rich format and embedded URLs.
Ensure bot messages are re-sent to reflect changes in the selected sharing type.
