refactor: Standardize rounded corners and purchase screen styling

- Introduced new dimen resources (`radius_small`, `radius_normal`, `radius_large`) for consistent rounded corner application.
- Refactored `rectangle_rounded.xml` and `rectangle_rounded_small.xml`, and added `rectangle_rounded_large.xml`.
- Defined new theme attributes (`purchase_sc_feature_list_bg`, `purchase_sc_selected_plan_bg`, `purchase_sc_header_icon_bg`) and corresponding colors to enhance purchase screen UI customization for both light and dark themes.
- Applied new styling attributes to `fragment_choose_plan.xml` and `fragment_selected_plan.xml`, removing old background assignments and unused layout components.
- Updated `OsmAndFeature` string resource usage and adjusted header icon logic for `OsmAndProPlanFragment` and `ChoosePlanFragment`.
