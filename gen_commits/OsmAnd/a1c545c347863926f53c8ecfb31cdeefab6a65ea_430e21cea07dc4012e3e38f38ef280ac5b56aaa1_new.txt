feat: Add MOTD display to OsMo groups

Introduces a Message Of The Day (MOTD) feature in the OsMo groups list.
A dedicated TextView is added to the header to display server-provided messages.
The OsMo service is updated to handle MOTD commands and store the message in session info, while the OsMo thread requests updates on changes.
Also refactors the layout of group items (osmo_group_item.xml and osmo_group_list_item.xml) to better utilize available space using fill_parent and layout_weight.
Corrects a French string escaping issue and adjusts the position of the OsMo groups option in the map activity context menu.
