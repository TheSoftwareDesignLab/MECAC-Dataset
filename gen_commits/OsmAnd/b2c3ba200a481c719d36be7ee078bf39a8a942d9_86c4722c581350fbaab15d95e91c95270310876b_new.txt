refactor: Use dedicated paint for ruler text outline

Introduces `circleAttrs.paint3` to draw a white outline around text on the ruler control layer. This separates the responsibility from `circleAttrs.shadowPaint`, which is now exclusively used for drawing the circle's shadow. The change improves text readability on various map backgrounds.
