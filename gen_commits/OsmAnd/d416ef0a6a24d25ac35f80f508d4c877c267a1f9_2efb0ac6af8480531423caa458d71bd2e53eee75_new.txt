refactor: Improve POI duplicate filtering logic

Refactor duplicate POI subtype comparison in `SearchUICore` for better readability and conciseness.
The logic now explicitly compares the filter status of two subtypes, ensuring consistent prioritization.

Also, apply minor whitespace adjustments in `Building.java`'s `toString` method for improved readability.
