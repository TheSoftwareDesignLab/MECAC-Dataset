refactor: Simplify route rule and elevation tag retrieval

Renamed `routeType` to `ruleid` in `RouteTypeCondition` for clarity regarding its purpose as a rule identifier.

Introduced a new `getValue(int pnt, String tag)` method in `RouteDataObject` to centralize the retrieval of tag values associated with specific route points. This simplifies the elevation calculation logic in `calculateHeightArray`, improving readability and maintainability.
