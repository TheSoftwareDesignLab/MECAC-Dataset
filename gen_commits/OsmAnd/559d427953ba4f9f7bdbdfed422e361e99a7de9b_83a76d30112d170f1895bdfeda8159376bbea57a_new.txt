feat: Add support for OBD AT text commands

Introduces `textCommand` and `isHexAnswer` fields in `OBDCommand` to handle
non-PID, text-based commands (e.g., "AT RV").
Updates `OBDDispatcher` and `Obd2Connection` to correctly send text
commands and parse their string responses.
Adds `OBD_ALT_BATTERY_VOLTAGE_COMMAND` to read adapter battery voltage.
