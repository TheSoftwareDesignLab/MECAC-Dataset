refactor: Remove Tips & Tricks feature and standardize list item styles

- Removed obsolete 'Tips and Tricks' feature along with its activity and layout files.
- Unified text sizes across multiple list item layouts to `default_list_text_size`.
- Adjusted padding and layout for `searchbyname_list.xml` and `simple_list_menu_item.xml` for improved UI consistency.
