feat: Show buffered location duration in status widget

The status widget now displays the time elapsed since the first location message
was buffered, instead of just the number of buffered messages. This provides
more meaningful feedback to the user about how long their location data has
been accumulating.

- Introduced `firstWriteTime` to track the timestamp of the oldest buffered message.
- Updated `ShowLocationHelper` to use this time for display.
- Added `OsmandFormatter.getFormattedDurationShort` for concise duration display.
- Clarified `buffer_time_descr` string resource.
