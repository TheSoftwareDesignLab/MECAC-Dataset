feat: Enhance turn instructions with destination shields and refs

Refactor destination handling to separately manage destination names and
references. Introduces a new utility method to clean up repeated
destination references (e.g., "M5;M5" becomes "M5").

- `RouteDirectionInfo` now stores `destinationRef` separately.
- `RouteSegmentResult.getDestinationName` can now optionally include `destinationRef`.
- `RoadShield` includes `createDestination` for improved shield generation
  aligned with destination references.
- Voice prompts and turn descriptions are updated to use the combined
  destination reference and name for clearer guidance.
