refactor: Replace application context with specific UI contexts

Replaced direct usage of the OsmandApplication instance with more
specific Context objects (e.g., Activity, ViewGroup, Fragment contexts)
for UI-related operations like inflating layouts and creating view
containers. This improves context management and adheres to Android
best practices.
