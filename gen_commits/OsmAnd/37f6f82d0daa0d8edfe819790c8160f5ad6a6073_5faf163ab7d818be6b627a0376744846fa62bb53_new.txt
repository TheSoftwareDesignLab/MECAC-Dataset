feat: Improve OBD connection lifecycle and error handling

- Introduced `isFinished` flag in `Obd2Connection` for graceful termination of the reading process.
- Refactored `OBDDispatcher` to use the `isFinished` flag, ensuring the read loop can be reliably stopped.
- Enhanced error handling for `NO_DATA` and `ERROR` responses from OBD commands.
- Implemented automatic disconnection when 'Simulate OBD Data' setting is turned off.
- Ensured `OBDDispatcher.stopReading()` is called consistently during disconnects.
- Added validation to prevent saving OBD devices with empty addresses.
- Updated icons for connect/forget actions in the OBD device list.
