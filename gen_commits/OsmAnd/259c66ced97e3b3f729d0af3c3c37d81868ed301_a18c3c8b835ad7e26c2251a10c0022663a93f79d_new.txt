refactor: Replace hardcoded day mode text colors with resources

Introduces dedicated color resources (widgettext_day, widgettext_shadow_day) for day mode widget text and shadows.
This replaces hardcoded Color.BLACK and Color.WHITE, improving theming consistency and maintainability.
Also removes an unused 'shadowColor' field in MapControlsLayer.
