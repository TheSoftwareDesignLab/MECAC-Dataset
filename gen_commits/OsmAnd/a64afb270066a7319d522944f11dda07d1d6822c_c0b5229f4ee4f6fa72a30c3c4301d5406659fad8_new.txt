fix: Exclude zoomScale from map renderer zoom

Previously, `tilesRect.getZoomScale()` was included in the map renderer's zoom calculation. This could lead to incorrect zoom levels or visual artifacts. This change ensures only `getZoom()` and `getZoomAnimation()` are used for a more accurate rendering.
