feat: Toggle system UI (status/nav bar) on map tap

A single tap on the map, when no context menu is active, will now
also toggle the visibility of the system status and navigation bars.
This functionality is integrated with the existing map controls
visibility switch, using a new `switchStatusbarAndNavbarVisibility`
method in `MapControlsLayer`.
