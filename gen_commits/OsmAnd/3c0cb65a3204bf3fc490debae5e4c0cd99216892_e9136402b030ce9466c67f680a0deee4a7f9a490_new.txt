fix: Ensure track segment split view updates on back press

When navigating back from the split segments screen, the TrackSegmentFragment
was not automatically updating. This change ensures that the split interval
data and view are refreshed whenever the 'open_split_segments' back stack
entry is popped, either via the system back button or the action bar.
