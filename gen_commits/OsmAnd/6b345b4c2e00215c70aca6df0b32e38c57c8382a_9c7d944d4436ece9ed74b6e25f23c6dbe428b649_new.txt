refactor: Abstract backup types UI and controller logic

Refactor backup types selection screen by introducing new abstraction layers.
- `BackupTypesAdapter` is now abstract, defining common adapter structure.
- `SwitchBackupTypesAdapter` implements the UI for switch-based type selection.
- `BaseBackupTypesController` manages core data and common backup/delete listeners.
- `SwitchBackupTypesController` handles logic specific to switch-based selection.
- `BackupTypesController` and `VersionHistoryController` now extend `SwitchBackupTypesController`.
- Fragments delegate adapter creation to controllers and use `updateListeners`.

This improves modularity, separates concerns, and simplifies future UI variations.
