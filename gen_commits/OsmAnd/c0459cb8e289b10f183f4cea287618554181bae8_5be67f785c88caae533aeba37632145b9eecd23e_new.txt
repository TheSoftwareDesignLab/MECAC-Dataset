refactor: Standardize preference layouts and simplify settings

- Renamed `simple_preference_category.xml` to `preference_category_with_descr.xml` and updated its usage across preference screens.
- Standardized margins, padding, and vertical alignment (`android:layout_gravity="center_vertical"`) for various preference items.
- Ensured consistent icon spacing by setting `iconSpaceReserved(true)` for categories and individual preferences.
- Refactored `preference_top_switch` and `preference_radio_button` for better structure.
- Removed the "External Storage Directory" preference and its associated logic from XML and Java.
- Applied minor code cleanups in `MapActivity` and `ConfigureProfileFragment`.
