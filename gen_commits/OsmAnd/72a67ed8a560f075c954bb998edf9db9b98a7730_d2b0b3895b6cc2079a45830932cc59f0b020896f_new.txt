feat: Display road reference in current street name

The current street name displayed in the routing helper now includes the road reference (e.g., 'M1', 'A3') if available.
Refactored the logic for retrieving the street name from route segments when the primary name is empty, avoiding redundant calls and ensuring the text is correctly assigned before determining its presence.
