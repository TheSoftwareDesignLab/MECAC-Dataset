fix: Refine stepless zoom animation and gesture completion

Improve precision of stepless zoom animation by correctly incorporating
the ongoing zoomAnimation into the float part calculation during updates.

Refactor `finishPinchZoom` to `finishZoomAndRotationGesture` for
clarity and consistency, encompassing both zoom and rotation.

Ensure the map viewport's zoom and animation state is explicitly finalized
and refreshed upon multi-touch gesture completion. This prevents
inconsistencies, especially when stepless zoom is enabled.
