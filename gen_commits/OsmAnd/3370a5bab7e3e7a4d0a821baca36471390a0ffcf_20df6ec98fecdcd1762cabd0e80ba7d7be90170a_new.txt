fix(gpx): Show context menu at exact long-press location

Improve the precision of the context menu by using the pixel location of the long press
event when interacting with GPX track points. Previously, it used the GPX point's
exact coordinates, which might not always align with the actual tap location.

Refactor TrackMenuFragment's updateHeader logic into smaller, dedicated methods
to improve readability and maintainability of card management within the header.
