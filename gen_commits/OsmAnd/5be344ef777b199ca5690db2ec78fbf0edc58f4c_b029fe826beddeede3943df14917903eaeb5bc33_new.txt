refactor: Optimize elevation profile rendering and stat block layout

- `OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/views/mapwidgets/widgets/ElevationProfileWidget.java`: Optimized slope data set creation to only execute when slopes are displayed, improving efficiency.
- `OsmAnd/res/layout/item_elevation_stat_block.xml`: Changed layout height to `wrap_content` with `minHeight` for improved UI flexibility.
- `OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/inapp/InAppPurchaseHelper.java`: Enabled OsmAnd Pro availability unconditionally for development/testing purposes.
