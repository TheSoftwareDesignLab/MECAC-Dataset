feat: Redesign map context menu with new icons and flexible layout

- Introduced a new set of `map_action_`, `map_overflow_menu_`, `map_osm_`, and `map_small_group` icons across various densities.
- Converted hardcoded dimensions in `map_context_menu_fragment.xml` to `@dimen` resources for better adaptability.
- Updated icon references in related components to use the new drawable assets.
- Adjusted compass visibility logic and point editor save/dismiss behavior.
