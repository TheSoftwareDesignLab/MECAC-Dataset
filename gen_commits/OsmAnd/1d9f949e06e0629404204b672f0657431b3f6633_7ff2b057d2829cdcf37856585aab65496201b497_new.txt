feat: Improve map widget height flexibility

Changed `layout_height` to `wrap_content` and added `minHeight` for large and medium map widgets. This allows widgets to dynamically adjust their height based on content while ensuring a minimum size.

Refactored ConstraintLayout attributes from `app:` to `osmand:` namespace in `simple_map_widget_large.xml`. Also included minor layout adjustments and added `tools:text` for better previewing.
