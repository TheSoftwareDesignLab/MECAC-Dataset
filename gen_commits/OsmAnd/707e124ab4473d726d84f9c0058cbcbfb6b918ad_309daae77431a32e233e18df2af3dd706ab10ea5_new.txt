feat: Pause compass updates during map marker item swipe

Introduces a mechanism to temporarily halt compass-based UI updates when a user starts swiping an item in the map markers list. This prevents visual flickering and improves the fluidity of the swipe gesture by ensuring that distance/direction calculations are not performed until the swipe interaction completes.
