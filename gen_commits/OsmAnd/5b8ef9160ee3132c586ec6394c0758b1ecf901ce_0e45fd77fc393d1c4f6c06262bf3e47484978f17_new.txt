fix: Improve accuracy of unknown word counting in search

Introduces a `startWith` parameter to `countUnknownWordsMatch` methods. This parameter allows
explicitly indicating how many leading unknown words in a search phrase are already
considered matched (e.g., by a POI type or an object name).

This refinement improves the accuracy of word counting and highlighting in complex
search queries, addressing previous limitations in scenarios where POI types are
embedded in the phrase.

Updates test resource paths for phrase files.
