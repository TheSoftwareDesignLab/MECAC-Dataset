fix: Profile save thread, dialog theming, and method cleanup

- Ensured profile saving operations in `ProfileAppearanceFragment` are executed on the UI thread to prevent potential UI blocking.
- Applied correct theming to the speed camera confirmation dialog in `VoiceAnnouncesFragment` to respect the current day/night mode.
- Removed the unused `shareProfile` method from `ConfigureProfileFragment`.
