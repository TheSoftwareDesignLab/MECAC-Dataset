refactor: Migrate Save As New Track dialog to items list

The SaveAsNewTrackBottomSheetDialogFragment now constructs its UI programmatically using MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment's BaseBottomSheetItems.
This refactors the monolithic XML layout into a more modular structure, extracting the images row into a dedicated layout file (`fragment_save_as_new_track_images_row.xml`).
