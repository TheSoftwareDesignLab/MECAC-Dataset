fix: Refresh map controls on RTL layout orientation change

Detects changes in RTL (Right-to-Left) layout orientation when MapActivity
resumes. If the orientation has changed, it triggers a refresh of the map
controls buttons to ensure they are correctly positioned and rendered for
the new layout direction. This prevents potential UI inconsistencies when
the user changes system language/layout settings while the app is in the
background.
