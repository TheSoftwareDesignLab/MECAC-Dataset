feat: Implement fractional zoom and density scaling for map tiles

Refactors map tile drawing in OsmandMapTileView to support non-integer
zoom levels and properly scale tiles based on display density, leading
to smoother map rendering.

- OsmandMapTileView:
    - Updated `getTileSize()` to calculate tile dimensions considering
      fractional zoom and display density.
    - Simplified `refreshMapInternal()` to consistently use scaled
      drawing for all map tiles.
- VoiceRouter: Refined conditions for triggering destination arrival
  voice announcements.
- YandexTrafficLayer: Optimized tile drawing using `Rect` and `RectF`
  for source and destination bitmaps.
- ToDoConstants: Updated TODO list and removed outdated bug comments.
