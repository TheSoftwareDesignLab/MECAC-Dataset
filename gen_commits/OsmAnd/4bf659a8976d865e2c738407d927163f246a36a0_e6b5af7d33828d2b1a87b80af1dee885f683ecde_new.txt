feat: Improve UI layout and flexibility for lists and dialogs

Enhance GPX overview fragment summary to be horizontally scrollable,
preventing truncation of activity and region details.

Update bottom sheet items to use wrap_content for height with a minHeight,
allowing better adaptability for varying content.

Introduce convenience methods for DisplayItem to control bottom divider
visibility, which is now respected in SingleSelectionAdapter.

Refactor SelectRouteActivityController to use DisplayItem directly for
search results, simplifying data handling.

Removed deprecated margin attributes (`android:layout_marginRight`/`Left`).
