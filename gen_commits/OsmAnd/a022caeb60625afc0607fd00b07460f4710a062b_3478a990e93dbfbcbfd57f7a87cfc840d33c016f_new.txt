refactor: Update tag list view creation and theme text colors

Removed view caching for tag list items in AdvancedDataFragment, simplifying view management and preventing potential issues with state reuse.

Adjusted `android:textColorSecondary` in both OsmandLightTheme and OsmandDarkTheme for improved visual consistency and readability across different UI elements.

Also cleaned up an unused `HashMap` import and enhanced debug logging in `AdvancedDataFragment`.
