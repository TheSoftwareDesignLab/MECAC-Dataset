refactor(route-line): Improve color controller lifecycle management

Introduces `onResume` and `onPause` methods to `RouteLineColorController` to properly activate and deactivate the map theme provider. The `RouteLineAppearanceFragment` now calls these lifecycle methods on its controller. Extracts predefined colors retrieval into a new static method.
