fix: Manage NearbyPlacesFragment without back stack

The NearbyPlacesFragment is now explicitly removed from the fragment manager when navigating back, rather than being added to and popped from the back stack. This simplifies its lifecycle management and resolves potential navigation issues. The unused PREFERRED_NEARBY_PLACES_ZOOM constant has also been removed.
