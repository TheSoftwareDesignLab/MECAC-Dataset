fix: Enforce full Telegram live location period constraints

Introduces explicit MIN/MAX constants for Telegram API live location periods
in `TelegramHelper`. The `sendLiveLocationImpl` method now strictly clamps
the live period to both the minimum and maximum API bounds.

Previously, only the minimum live period was enforced, potentially allowing
values exceeding the Telegram API maximum. UI-related min/max constants in
`ShareLocationHelper` are updated to reference these API constants with a
small offset for clearer separation.
