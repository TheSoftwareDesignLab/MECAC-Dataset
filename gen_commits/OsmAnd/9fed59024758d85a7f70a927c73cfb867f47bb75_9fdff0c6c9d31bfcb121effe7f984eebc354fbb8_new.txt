feat: Add ability to manage custom input device profiles

Introduces full CRUD-like functionality for external input device profiles.
Users can now:
- Add new custom device profiles via a toolbar action button.
- Rename existing custom profiles.
- Duplicate any existing device profile (custom or system) to create a new custom one.
- Remove custom device profiles with a confirmation dialog.
Includes UI adjustments with new dialogs for input and confirmation,
and logic for generating unique names for new or duplicated profiles.
