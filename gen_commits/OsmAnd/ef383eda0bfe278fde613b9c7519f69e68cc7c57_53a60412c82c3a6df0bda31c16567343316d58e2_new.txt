feat: Implement responsive route info widgets

- Introduce `MultiTextViewEx` for displaying multiple text elements with individual styling and auto-sizing.
- Overhaul RouteInfoWidget layouts (small, medium, large) to dynamically adapt content based on available width and secondary data presence.
- Update `ISupportMultiRow` to pass `widgetsCount` for more granular layout adjustments.
