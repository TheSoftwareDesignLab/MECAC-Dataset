refactor: Improve Reports fragment layout and code quality

Refactored `fragment_reports.xml` to use a ScrollView, ensuring content
is scrollable. Standardized icon widths, improved padding/margins,
and enhanced progress bar visibility with a dynamic divider.

Added `@NonNull` annotations to method parameters and fields in related
LiveUpdates classes for better null-safety. Simplified enum declarations
and AsyncTask parameter passing.
