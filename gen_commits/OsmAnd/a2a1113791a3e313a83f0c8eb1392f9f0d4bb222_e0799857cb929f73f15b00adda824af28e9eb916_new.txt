feat: Add route animation for navigation simulation

Introduces a new menu option to animate the current position along a calculated route.
This feature leverages mock locations and requires "Allow mock locations" to be enabled in developer settings.
A new `LatLonUtils` class is added to facilitate calculations for intermediate route points.
The `RouteAnimation` class manages the simulation thread and updates the map activity with new positions.
