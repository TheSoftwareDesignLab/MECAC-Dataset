refactor: Improve animated zoom level calculation and rendering

Refactors how animated zoom levels are calculated and applied.
The 'Zoom' class now extends the fractional part range from [-0.5, 0.5) to approximately [-0.6, 0.6), allowing for smoother transitions without immediate integer zoom level changes.
The map renderer now receives the base zoom level (enum) and the visual fractional zoom separately, enhancing the precision of intermediate zoom state rendering.
This change results in a more fluid and visually consistent animated zoom experience.
