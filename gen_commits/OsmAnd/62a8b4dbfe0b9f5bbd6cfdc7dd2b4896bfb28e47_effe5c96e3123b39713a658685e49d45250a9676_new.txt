feat: Add reusable map controls and integrate into track menu

Extract map ruler and HUD controls into `context_menu_controls.xml`.
Integrate this new reusable layout into `track_menu.xml`, `follow_track_options.xml`, and `track_appearance.xml`.
Hide the "my location" button in portrait mode within `TrackMenuFragment` to prevent UI overlap.
Adjust `MapQuickActionLayer` to hide quick action buttons when the track menu is active, ensuring proper display of the new controls.
