refactor: Consolidate location and navigation icon types

The `NavigationIcon` enum has been merged into `LocationIcon` to unify the handling of all map-related icons.

- `LocationIcon` now includes movement-related icons (e.g., MOVEMENT_DEFAULT, MOVEMENT_CAR) previously found in `NavigationIcon`.
- Introduced `isOriginallyUsedForNavigation` flag and `staticLocation` parameter in `fromName` and `getDrawable` methods to differentiate icon usage contexts.
- Added `LocationIconPreviousNamesMapper` for backward compatibility of previous navigation icon names.
- `IIconsPaletteController` now supports custom palette titles via `getPaletteTitle()`.
- The `LocationIconPaletteElements` now dynamically renders icons based on their original usage (static vs. movement).
