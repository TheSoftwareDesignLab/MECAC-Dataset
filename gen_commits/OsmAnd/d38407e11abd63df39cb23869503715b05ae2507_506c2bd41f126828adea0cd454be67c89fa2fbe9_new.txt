feat: Dedicated navigation service for continuous tracking

Introduces a dedicated NavigationService instance that is started and stopped
when route following begins or ends. This ensures continuous tracking without
being affected by the regular background service interval.

Refactors:
- NavigationService to differentiate between general background monitoring
  and active navigation for continuous operation.
- RoutingHelper to manage starting/stopping the NavigationService based on
  `setFollowingMode()`.
- MapActivity to centralize route following logic into a new `followRoute()` method.
- Updates `RoutingHelper` constructor to use `OsmandApplication` context.
- Adds "No route" string resource and updates navigation dialog buttons.
- Includes new `monitoring.png` assets.
