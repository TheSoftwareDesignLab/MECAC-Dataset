feat: Adapt map context menus to day/night mode

- The Point Editor, Multi-Selection, and Share menus now dynamically adjust their appearance based on the current day/night theme.
- This includes setting appropriate backgrounds, primary/secondary text colors, and hint text colors.
- Introduced a new `setHintTextSecondaryColor` utility in `AndroidUtils`.
- Added IDs to `point_editor_fragment.xml` for targeted styling of scroll view and description elements.
- The MapContextMenu now re-initializes when the application mode changes to ensure theme consistency.
