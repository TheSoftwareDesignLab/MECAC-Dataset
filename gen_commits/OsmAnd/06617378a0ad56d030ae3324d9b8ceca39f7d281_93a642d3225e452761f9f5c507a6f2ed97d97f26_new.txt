feat: Add segment selection for multi-segment GPX tracks

Introduces the ability to select a specific segment from multi-segment
GPX tracks before initiating navigation.

- Displays a new `TrackSelectSegmentBottomSheet` when a GPX track
  with multiple segments is chosen, allowing the user to pick one.
- Implements the routing logic to follow the user-selected segment.
- Updates UI for `bottom_sheet_select_segment.xml` and
  `gpx_segment_list_item.xml` with padding adjustments, text styling,
  and an updated distance icon.
