feat: Make route and display preferences profile-specific

Changed various navigation and display preferences from global to profile-specific.
This includes: SHOW_SPEED_LIMITS, SHOW_CAMERAS, SHOW_LANES, AVOID_TOLL_ROADS,
AVOID_MOTORWAY, AVOID_UNPAVED_ROADS, and AVOID_FERRIES.
Users can now configure these settings independently for each application mode
(e.g., Car, Pedestrian).

Also ensures OPTIMAL_ROUTE_MODE is correctly applied to the active application mode.
