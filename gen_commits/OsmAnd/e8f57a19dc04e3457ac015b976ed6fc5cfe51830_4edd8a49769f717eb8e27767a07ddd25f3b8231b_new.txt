feat: Allow users to select azimuth units (degrees/milliradians)

Introduces a new preference in General Settings to switch between degrees and milliradians for angular measurements. The OsmAndFormatter now formats azimuth based on this user-selected unit, affecting displays in the Measurement Tool, Route Info Widgets, and other relevant UI elements.
