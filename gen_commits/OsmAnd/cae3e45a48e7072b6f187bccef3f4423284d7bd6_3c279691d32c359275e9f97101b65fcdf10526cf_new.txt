fix: Always call animation finish callback

Ensure finishAnimationCallback is consistently invoked regardless of whether
the animation thread was stopped prematurely. Previously, the callback
might not be triggered if the thread was marked as stopped during animation.
This change guarantees the callback always runs at the end of an animation
attempt.
