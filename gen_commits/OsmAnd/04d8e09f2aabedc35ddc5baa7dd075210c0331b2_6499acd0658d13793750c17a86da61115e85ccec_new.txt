fix: Exclude Czech from default primary collation

The Czech locale, similar to Romanian and Slovak, can treat diacritics as primary differences during collation. By explicitly using `Locale.US` collator with `PRIMARY` strength for Czech, we ensure that only base character differences are considered for sorting, preventing unexpected orderings.
