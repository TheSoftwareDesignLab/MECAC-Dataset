fix: Correct route distance and improve GPX graph data processing

Fixes an off-by-one error in `getDistanceFromStart()` by adjusting the
array index and adding a boundary check.

In `GpxUiHelper`, initialize `x` to `0f` and change `x > 0` to `x >= 0`
to correctly handle data points with zero distance/time. Removes dead code.
