feat: Redesign coordinate input dialog UI

Replaced custom OsmandTextFieldBoxes with granular EditText fields.
Introduced dedicated N/S/E/W selection buttons and per-field backspace.
Extracted input area into `coordinate_input_data_area.xml` for reusability.
Updated Java logic to interact with new UI components and added new resources.
