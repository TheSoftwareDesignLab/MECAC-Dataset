feat: Add 'comment' background type and dynamic point selection icons

Introduces a new 'comment' background type for point markers.
This background is specifically used for OSM bug/note markers upon selection.
Replaces the static 'ic_shield_tap' selection icons with a dynamic system
that renders backgrounds based on the point's `BackgroundType`.
The 'comment' type is not user-selectable for general favourite points.
