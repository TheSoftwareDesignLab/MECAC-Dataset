refactor: Simplify spinner layout and remove custom dropdown icon

The custom `ImageView` used for the dropdown indicator of the `Spinner` in `spinner_rule_layout.xml` has been removed. The default Android `Spinner` widget provides its own dropdown functionality, making the custom icon redundant. This change also removes the associated Java code that set up and handled clicks for the custom `dropDownIcon`.
