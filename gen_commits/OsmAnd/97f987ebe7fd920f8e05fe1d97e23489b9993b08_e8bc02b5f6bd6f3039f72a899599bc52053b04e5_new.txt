feat: Enhance POI filter management and display

Refactor POI filter save and delete operations, moving them from
EditPOIFilterActivity to SearchPOIActivity.

This change:
- Simplifies EditPOIFilterActivity to focus on filter content.
- Integrates save/delete actions into SearchPOIActivity's options menu.
- Displays generated and truncated filter names in SearchPOIActivity's
  action bar for improved readability.
- Ensures saved filter names are applied correctly when a filter is
  selected for the map.
- Conditionally adds "Show All POI" filter based on Accessibility Plugin.
