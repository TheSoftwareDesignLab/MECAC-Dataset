feat: Add generic point information context menu

Introduces a new context menu controller and builder to display basic information for any tap on the map that doesn't correspond to an existing POI, favorite, or history item. This enables showing the point's description and coordinates.

Adds a fallback to use the last known location when initiating route calculations if no specific starting point is provided. This improves usability in cases where the 'from' location might be null.

Includes minor layout adjustments in the point editor fragment header and ensures proper layout refresh for the context menu title.
