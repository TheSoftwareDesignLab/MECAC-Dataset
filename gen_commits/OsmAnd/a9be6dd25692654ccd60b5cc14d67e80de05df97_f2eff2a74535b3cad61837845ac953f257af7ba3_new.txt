refactor: Make map context menu waypoint action text dynamic

The text for the waypoint/marker button in the map context menu is now set programmatically based on the context.
- Changed default 'Add to map markers' to 'Marker'.
- Changed 'Rename marker' for existing markers to 'Edit'.
- The XML layout no longer hardcodes the text, using `tools:text` for design-time preview.
