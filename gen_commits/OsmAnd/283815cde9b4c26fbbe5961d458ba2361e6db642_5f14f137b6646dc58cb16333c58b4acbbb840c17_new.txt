fix(cs-tts): Improve Czech grammar and add SVOX workarounds

Refactor distance and ordinal number generation to support grammatical cases.
This introduces locative, accusative, and instrumental cases for distances and ordinals, improving grammatical correctness and naturalness of navigation commands.
Includes specific workarounds for identified SVOX Classic TTS engine bugs, such as incorrect declension for 'go ahead' commands.
Changes distance prefix from 'o' to 'po' for better locative phrasing.
