refactor: Encapsulate periodic UI updates in dedicated handlers

This commit refactors the logic for periodic UI updates in `TripRecordingBottomSheet` and `DownloadTilesFragment`. Instead of managing `Handler` and `Runnable` instances directly within the fragments, dedicated `Handler` subclasses (`TripRecordingUpdatesHandler` and `UpdateTilesHandler`) are introduced. This centralizes the scheduling, starting, and stopping of recurring tasks (GPS status, track chart, tiles preview), leading to cleaner fragment code and improved separation of concerns.
