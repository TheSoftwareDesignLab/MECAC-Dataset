refactor: Distinguish internal and external widget IDs

Replaced the generic `KEY_WIDGET_ID` with more specific keys:
- `KEY_WIDGET_TYPE` for built-in widgets, passing `WidgetType.name()`.
- `KEY_EXTERNAL_WIDGET_ID` for AIDL (external) widgets.
This improves clarity and avoids ambiguity in bundle data handling for different widget sources.
