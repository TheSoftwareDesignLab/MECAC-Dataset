fix(geometry): Refine partial path drawing and update logic

Replaced the ambiguous `renew` flag with distinct `create` and `update` boolean variables within `cutStartOfCachedPath`. This change clarifies the intent, enabling separate handling for generating new path data lists (`create`) versus updating properties of an existing path line (e.g., `passedDist`) without full redraws (`update`). This improves efficiency and accuracy when rendering partial geometry ways.
