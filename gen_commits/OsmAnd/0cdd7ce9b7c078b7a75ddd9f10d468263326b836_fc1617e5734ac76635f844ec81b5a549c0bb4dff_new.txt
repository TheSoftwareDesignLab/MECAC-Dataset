feat: Display current/next street name in top bar during navigation

Add functionality to show the current or next street name with its reference
in the top information bar when following a route or viewing directions.

- Introduce `getCurrentName()` and `formatStreetName()` in RoutingHelper.
- Update MapInfoLayer to dynamically set and size the top text view.
- Refactor ShadowText drawing to use a static helper method.
- Ensure top text color and bold status update with theme changes.
