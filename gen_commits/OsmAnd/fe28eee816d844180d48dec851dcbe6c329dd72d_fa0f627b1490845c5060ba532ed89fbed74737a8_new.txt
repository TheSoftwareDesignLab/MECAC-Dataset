feat: Respect system font size in help article WebView

Enhance accessibility by dynamically adjusting the font size of the help article
WebView. The WebView now scales its content based on the system's global font
size setting, using setTextZoom for API 14+ and WebSettings.TextSize enums for
older Android versions.
