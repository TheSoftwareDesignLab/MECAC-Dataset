feat: Improve OSM Notes menu toggle and sub-option logic

Refreshes dashboard content when OSM Notes visibility changes.
Provides visual feedback for the "OSM Notes" toggle by changing its icon color based on its active state and day/night mode.
Disables related sub-options ("Show zoom level" and "Show closed notes") when OSM Notes are hidden, preventing illogical interactions.
