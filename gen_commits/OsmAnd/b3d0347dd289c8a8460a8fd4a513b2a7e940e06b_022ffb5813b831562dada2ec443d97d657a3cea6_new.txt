fix: Improve measurement tool robustness and UI consistency

- Add null safety checks for measurementLayer in MeasurementToolFragment.
- Refactor *OnClick methods to on* for better naming convention.
- Ensure consistent UI inflation with day/night mode in RouteBetweenPointsBottomSheet.
- Standardize DEFAULT_APP_MODE for straight-line routing.
