refactor: Split LockInfoControl into dedicated monitoring & screen lock

The original LockInfoControl had dual responsibilities for screen locking and managing quick actions for background services and monitoring. This commit refactors it by:
- Deleting LockInfoControl.java.
- Introducing MonitoringInfoControl.java to handle quick actions for monitoring services (e.g., background service, track recording).
- Moving the screen lock functionality directly into MapInfoLayer's createLockInfo method.
Plugins like OsmandBackgroundServicePlugin and OsmandMonitoringPlugin are updated to use the new MonitoringInfoControl for their respective actions.
