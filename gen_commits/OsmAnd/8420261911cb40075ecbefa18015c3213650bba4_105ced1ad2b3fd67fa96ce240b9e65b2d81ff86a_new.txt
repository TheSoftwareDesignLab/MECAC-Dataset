feat: Allow controlling map tilt animation duration

The `startTilting` method in `AnimateDraggingMapThread` now accepts an `elevationTime` parameter. This allows callers to specify a fixed duration for the tilt animation. If `elevationTime` is 0, the animation duration is dynamically calculated based on the angle difference.

Call sites updated:
- `OsmandMapTileView` now explicitly uses `ZOOM_ANIMATION_TIME` for tilt adjustments based on zoom level.
- `SurfaceRenderer` and `Map3DButton` pass `0.0f` to retain the default dynamic animation duration.
`ZOOM_ANIMATION_TIME` was also made public for external usage.
