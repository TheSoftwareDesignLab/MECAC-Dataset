refactor: Improve profile list item layout and dialog initialization

Adjusted profile_list_item.xml for consistent icon sizing, margin values, and divider placement, enhancing visual alignment.
Refactored AppModesBottomSheetDialogFragment by moving RecyclerView setup to onCreateView for proper view lifecycle management.
Implemented fallback icon display in ProfileMenuAdapter for profiles without a specific icon, defaulting to a parent's icon or a world globe.
Changed EditProfileActivity home button action to onBackPressed() for consistent navigation flow.
