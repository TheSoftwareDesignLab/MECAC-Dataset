feat: Add live routing visualization

Introduces a `RouteSegmentVisitor` in `BinaryRouteDataReader` to allow external
components to monitor the routing process.

Routing calculations in `MapRouterLayer` are now executed in background threads
to prevent UI freezes. The new visitor is used to incrementally display visited
road segments on the map during the `selfRoute` calculation, providing real-time
visual feedback of the routing algorithm's progress.
