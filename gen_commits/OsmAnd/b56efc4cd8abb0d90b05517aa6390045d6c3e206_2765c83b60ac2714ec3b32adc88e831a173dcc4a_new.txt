feat: Add new icons and fix sensor widget typo

- Add new sensor-related icons (outlined bicycle power, cadence, distance, speed, heart rate, find, off, remove).
- Add new general icons (outlined edit, settings, signal, signal not found).
- Update `ic_action_edit_dark` and `widget_sensor_bicycle_power` drawables.
- Rename `widget_sensort_distance_day` and `widget_sensort_distance_night` to `widget_sensor_distance_day` and `widget_sensor_distance_night` to correct a typo.
- Update `WidgetType` to reflect the renamed distance sensor resources.
