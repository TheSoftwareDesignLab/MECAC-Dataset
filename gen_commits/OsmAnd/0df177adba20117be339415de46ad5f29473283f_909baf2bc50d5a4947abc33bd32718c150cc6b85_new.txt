feat: Add true bearing map widget

Introduce a new map widget to display the true bearing to a target point.
The `BearingWidget` was refactored to use an enum `BearingType` to differentiate between relative, magnetic, and true bearing calculations.
This includes adding the necessary string resources, widget parameters, and integrating it into the widget settings.
