feat: Add speed camera legal warning and management UI

Introduce legal disclaimers and management UI for speed camera features.
A new `SpeedCamerasBottomSheet` informs users about legal restrictions on speed camera warnings.
This bottom sheet is accessible via a new 'Uninstall speed cameras' preference in Global Settings under a 'Legal' category, and through an alert linked to the 'Show cameras' and 'Speak cameras' preferences in Screen Alerts and Voice Announces settings, respectively.
