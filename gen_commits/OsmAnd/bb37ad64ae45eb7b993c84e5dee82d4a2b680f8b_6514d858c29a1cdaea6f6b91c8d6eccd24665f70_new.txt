feat: Make ANT+ sensors list fragment content scrollable

Wrap the main content of the ANT+ sensors list fragment in a `NestedScrollView`.
This change ensures that all UI elements, including the empty state, device lists,
and Bluetooth status messages, are scrollable if they exceed the screen height.
This improves UI adaptability and prevents content truncation.
