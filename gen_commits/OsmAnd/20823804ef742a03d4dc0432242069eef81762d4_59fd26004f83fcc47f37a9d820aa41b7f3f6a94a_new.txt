refactor: Improve Tripltek promo card display and state handling

Adjusts the logic for showing the Tripltek promo card and its subscription state.
- The promo card is now displayed in PurchasesFragment if it's a Tripltek build.
- The Tripltek promo's subscription state in PurchaseUiData is dynamically set to ACTIVE or EXPIRED based on its actual availability.
