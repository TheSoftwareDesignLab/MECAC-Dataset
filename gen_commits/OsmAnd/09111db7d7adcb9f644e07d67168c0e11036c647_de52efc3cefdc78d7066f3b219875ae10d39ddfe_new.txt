fix(i18n): Improve Slovak localization and remove redundant cs-rSK locale

Corrected 'Preprava' to 'Doprava' for transportation amenity type.
Corrected 'Akýkoľvek' to 'Akékoľvek' for 'any_poi'.
Added new strings for voice navigation and rendering trace.
Removed `values-cs-rSK/strings.xml` as it was an incorrect/redundant locale.
