chore(strings): Remove deprecated map widget title strings

Removed 'map_center_widget' and 'current_location_widget' string keys from all
localized string resource files.
These keys were redundant or superseded by the more specific 'coordinates_widget_map_center'
and 'coordinates_widget_current_location' keys, which provide the "Coordinates:" prefix.
The base English strings.xml sees these keys re-positioned with their existing "Coordinates:" content.
