style: Refine track UI padding, text color, and dialog label

Adjusted horizontal padding in track import, navigation options, and radio buttons layouts for better consistency.
Applied `textColorSecondary` to the import track description.
Changed "Cancel" button to "Close" in `FollowTrackFragment` dialog for clarity.
Includes minor code style adjustments (import order, whitespace).
