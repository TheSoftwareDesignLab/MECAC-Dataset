feat(aidl): Allow returning generated filename for GPX navigation

The `navigateGpx` AIDL method now uses an `inout` parameter for `NavigateGpxParams`, which includes a new `fileName` field. This enables the service to return the dynamically generated filename of the imported GPX file to the client.

The underlying implementation has been refactored to use a dedicated `NavigateGpxHelper` class, removing the old broadcast intent mechanism and consolidating GPX handling logic.
