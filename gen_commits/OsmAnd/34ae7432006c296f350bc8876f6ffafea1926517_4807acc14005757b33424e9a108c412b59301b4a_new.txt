refactor: Remove SelectLocationController from AddPointBottomSheet

Permanently removes the commented-out code block that integrated `SelectLocationController.showDialog` for selecting a point on the map. This streamlines the "Select on map" functionality by reverting to the direct `MapRouteInfoMenu.selectOnScreen` call after the bottom sheet is dismissed.
