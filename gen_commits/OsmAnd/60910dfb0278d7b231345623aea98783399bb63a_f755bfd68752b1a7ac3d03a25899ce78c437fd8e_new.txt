fix(i18n): Correct string formatting in various translations

Many localized strings had incorrect or incomplete Android format specifiers (e.g., %1$ instead of %1$s, or missing type characters like 's' or 'd'). Additionally, minor textual issues like stray characters were fixed. These corrections ensure proper string rendering and prevent potential runtime errors across multiple languages.
