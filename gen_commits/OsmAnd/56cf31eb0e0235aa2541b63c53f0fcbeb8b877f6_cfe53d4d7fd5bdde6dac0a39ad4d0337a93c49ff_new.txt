feat: Redesign Wikivoyage search list item UI

Refactors the Wikivoyage search results list item layout for a modern, card-like appearance.
Replaces previous debug-style text fields with an icon, title, and description.
Introduces a themed divider between items, which is hidden for the last item.
Adds vertical scrollbars to the RecyclerView for improved navigation.
Updates the `SearchRecyclerViewAdapter` to bind data to the new UI elements and integrate `IconsCache`.
