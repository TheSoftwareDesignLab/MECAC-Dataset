feat(androidauto): Start and manage navigation simulation

Allows navigation simulation to be initiated directly from the `RoutePreviewScreen` when "Auto drive enabled" is triggered in an Android Auto session.

Introduces `simulateNavigationStartedFromAdb` to track if the simulation originated from auto drive. This flag ensures `simulateNavigation` is reset upon `NavigationSession` destruction when it was started from auto drive. The simulation will only start if `settings.simulateNavigation` is currently `false`.
