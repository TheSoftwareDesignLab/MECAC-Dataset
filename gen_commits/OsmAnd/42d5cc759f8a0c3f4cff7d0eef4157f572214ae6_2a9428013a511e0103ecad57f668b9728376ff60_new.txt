feat: Blink OsmAnd status widget on location share

Adds a blinking effect to the OsmAnd status widget when location data is successfully sent. This provides visual feedback for successful updates.

Also refines the widget's sub-text to display 'Error' for recent non-sending updates (less than 2 minutes), hiding the duration.
