feat: Add map marker grouping and date headers

Implement grouping of map markers by their group name.
Markers without a group are displayed with chronological headers (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, Month, Year).
Refactor MapMarkersGroupsAdapter to support multiple view types for headers and markers.
Rename map marker date layout and view holder to generic header types.
Integrate location and compass updates in MapMarkersGroupsFragment to provide context for display.
