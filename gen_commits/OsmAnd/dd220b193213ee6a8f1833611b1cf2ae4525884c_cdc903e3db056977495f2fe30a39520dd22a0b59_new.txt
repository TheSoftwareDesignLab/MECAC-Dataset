fix: Prevent text overlap in bottom sheet slider item layout

Switched root from FrameLayout to LinearLayout for better horizontal distribution of text views.
The title now expands with layout_weight and a Space element ensures consistent
separation from the summary. This resolves potential text overlapping issues,
especially with long titles, improving UI robustness.
