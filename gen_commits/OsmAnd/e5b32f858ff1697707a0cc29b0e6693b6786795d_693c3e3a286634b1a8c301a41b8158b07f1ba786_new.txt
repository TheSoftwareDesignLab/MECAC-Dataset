refactor: Simplify map gesture handling with SimpleOnGestureListener

Migrates gesture detection in MapExplorer and OsmandMapTileView to use
GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener. This change consolidates the
OnGestureListener and OnDoubleTapListener interfaces into a single base class,
reducing boilerplate and improving code organization.
