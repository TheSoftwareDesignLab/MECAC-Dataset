feat: Enable dynamic button updates for TitleWithButtonItem

Refactored TitleWithButtonItem to allow its button's icon and text to be updated dynamically via new setters. FavouritesBottomSheetMenuFragment now uses this for its sort button. Also ensured MapRouteInfoMenu's route spinners update correctly on favorite selection or dialog dismissal, and extracted spinner setup logic into a reusable method.
