feat: Remember and restore dashboard scroll positions

This change enhances the dashboard by persisting the scroll state for different dashboard types. When navigating between dashboard screens, the last known scroll position for each type is now saved and restored, improving user experience by maintaining context.

- Introduce `lastKnownScrolls` map to store scroll positions per DashboardType.
- Save scroll positions on `onScrollChanged` and apply them when a dashboard is shown.
- Remove scroll position from memory when a dashboard screen is dismissed.
- Refactor scroll handling into `onScrollChangedImpl` and `applyScrollPosition`.
