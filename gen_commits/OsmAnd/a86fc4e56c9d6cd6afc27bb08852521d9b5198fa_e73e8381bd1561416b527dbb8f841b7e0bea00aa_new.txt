feat: Improve window insets handling for edge-to-edge displays

- Introduce `ObservableFrameLayout` to monitor bottom fragment container visibility.
- Centralize window inset propagation to `MapLayers` and individual `OsmandMapLayer` instances.
- Dynamically adjust `MapHudLayout` and bottom widget panel paddings/backgrounds based on content visibility and system insets to support edge-to-edge layouts.
- Refactor inset application logic in `MapActivity` and `OsmandActionBarActivity`.
