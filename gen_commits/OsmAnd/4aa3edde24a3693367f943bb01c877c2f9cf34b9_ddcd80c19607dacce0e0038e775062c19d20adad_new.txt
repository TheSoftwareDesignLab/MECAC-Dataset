fix: Improve preference text color readability

Introduced dedicated theme styles for preference activities (`_Preferences`)
to explicitly set `android:textColorSecondary`. This ensures better contrast
and readability for summary texts and other secondary information within
settings screens, addressing potential visibility issues in both light
and dark themes.
