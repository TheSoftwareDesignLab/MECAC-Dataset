refactor: Implement listener for OBD connection state updates

OBDMainFragment now implements VehicleMetricsPlugin.ConnectionStateListener. This change decouples UI updates from direct connection/disconnection attempts. Instead, the UI (connection status and button) is updated reactively via the onStateChanged callback, ensuring consistency and responsiveness when the OBD connection state changes. The listener is registered in onResume and unregistered in onPause.
