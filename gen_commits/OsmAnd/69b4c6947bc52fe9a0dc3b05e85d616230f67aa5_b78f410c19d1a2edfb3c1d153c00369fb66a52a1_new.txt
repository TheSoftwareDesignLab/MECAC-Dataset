feat(i18n): Add Italian strings for map widgets and service controls

Adds new Italian translations for various map widget elements (e.g., configuration, map selection, speed, altitude, next turn, parking, monitoring).
Includes strings for background service screen lock, unlock, and wake-up interval settings.
Replaces the old 'monitoring info control' strings with the new 'map widget monitoring' string.
