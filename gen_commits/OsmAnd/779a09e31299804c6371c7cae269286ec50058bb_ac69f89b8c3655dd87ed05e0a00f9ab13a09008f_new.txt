refactor: Standardize and dynamically load back navigation icons

Replaced the deprecated `ic_action_mode_back` drawable with `ic_arrow_back` across layouts and styles.
Updated Java code to dynamically retrieve the navigation back icon using `AndroidUtils.getNavigationIconResId()`, enhancing consistency and adaptability.
Improved RTL support for navigation buttons in `TransportRouteController`.
