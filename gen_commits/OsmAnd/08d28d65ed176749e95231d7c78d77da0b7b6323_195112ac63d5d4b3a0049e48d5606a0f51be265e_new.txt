feat: Support custom routing profiles

This change introduces the ability to define and select custom routing profiles.
Routing profiles are now identified by string keys instead of a fixed enum,
allowing for dynamic loading of profiles from configuration files (e.g., profile.xml).
The UI has been updated to display and allow selection of these custom profiles.
