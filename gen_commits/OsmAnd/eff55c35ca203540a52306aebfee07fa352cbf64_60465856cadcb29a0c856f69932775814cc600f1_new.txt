feat: Display alarm warnings on Android Auto navigation screen

Refactors AlarmWidget to support rendering its content directly to a Bitmap, enabling its use on custom surfaces like the Android Auto Car App's navigation screen.
The SurfaceRenderer now provides a callback to allow NavigationScreen to draw the alarm widget, ensuring important driving alerts are visible within the car app.
