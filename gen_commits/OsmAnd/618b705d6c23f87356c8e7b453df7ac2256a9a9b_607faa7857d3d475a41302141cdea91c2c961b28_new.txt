refactor: Generalize download events propagation

The DownloadIndexesThread now uses a single DownloadEvents UI activity callback instead of managing a set of listeners. This streamlines event registration and propagation.

MapActivity has been updated to broadcast download events to all active fragments implementing DownloadEvents. This reduces coupling by removing direct references to specific fragment types.

WikivoyageExploreDialogFragment now implements DownloadEvents to act as an intermediary, delegating these events to its child ExploreTabFragment.
