refactor: Map marker UI and location tracking improvements

Aligns map marker item elements vertically and sets the separator to be initially hidden. Dynamically colors the distance text and direction arrow based on whether the map is centered on the user's location. Refactors location parameter calculation to use MapViewTrackingUtilities for better modularity.
