feat: Add tablet-optimized landscape menu layout

Introduces a dedicated menu layout (`menu.xml`) for large-screen
landscape devices, along with a comprehensive set of new drawable
resources. This includes a new background, redesigned headliner
components, and distinct navigation buttons for map, search,
favorites, and settings. Old `headline_smap_bar-top-shadow.png`
files were removed.
