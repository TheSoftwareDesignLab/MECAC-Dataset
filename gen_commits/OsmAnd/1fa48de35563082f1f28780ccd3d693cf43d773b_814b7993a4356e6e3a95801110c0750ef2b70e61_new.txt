fix: Improve waypoint reached UI focus and update layouts

- Add `list_bigtextview.xml` for a generic large text display.
- Enhance focus handling in `waypoint_reached.xml`:
    - Block descendant focus on the root layout.
    - Set 'more info' button as unfocusable.
- Standardize header item layout in `AvoidSpecificRoads.java` to `list_menu_item_native`.
