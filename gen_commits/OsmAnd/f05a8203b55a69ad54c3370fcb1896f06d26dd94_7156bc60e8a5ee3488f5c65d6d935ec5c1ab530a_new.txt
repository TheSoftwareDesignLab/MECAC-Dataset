fix(es): Translate "Recent Changes" tip and add new GPX strings

Corrected the Spanish translation for `tip_recent_changes_0_8_1_t`.
Added new strings for GPX upload privacy settings (`gpxup_public`, `gpxup_identifiable`, `gpxup_trackable`, `gpxup_private`) to `values-es/strings.xml`. These new strings are currently in English and await localization.
