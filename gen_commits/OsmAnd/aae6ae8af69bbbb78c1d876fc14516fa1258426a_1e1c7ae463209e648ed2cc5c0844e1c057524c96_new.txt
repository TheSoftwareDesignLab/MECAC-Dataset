refactor: Extract navigation point selection to dedicated controller

Extracts the logic for selecting navigation points (start, target, intermediate, home, work, parking) from `MapRouteInfoMenu` into a new `SelectNavigationPointController`.

This refactoring centralizes the selection flow, simplifies the `MapRouteInfoMenu` class, and improves separation of concerns. It updates relevant call sites and interfaces to use the new controller or its delegated methods.
