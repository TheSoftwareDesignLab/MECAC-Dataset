fix: Ensure map alarm widget text updates with region changes

Previously, the map alarm widget's main and bottom text might not
re-render correctly when the driving region changed. This could lead
to incorrect unit displays (e.g., mph vs. km/h) until the numerical
value itself changed. This commit ensures the text is updated immediately.

Also increases the widget's overall size and its bottom SI text
for improved visibility across various screen sizes.
