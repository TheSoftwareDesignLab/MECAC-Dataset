fix: Map view frames new route on missing last projection

When a new route is calculated, ensure the map view correctly frames it
even if `getLastProjection()` returns null.
Fallback to `getPointToStartLocation()` to find a valid start location
for map framing.

Also refactors `RoutingHelper.setNewRoute` to explicitly pass the
previous route state (`prevRoute`) to accurately determine if it's
a truly new route calculation.
