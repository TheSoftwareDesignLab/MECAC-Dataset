feat: Add forecast and tile status display to Weather widget

Introduce new constant '.tiff.db' for weather forecast database files.
Enhance the Weather widget to display detailed information about the active forecast when clicked.
This includes the forecast's effective time, its last download time, and the current status of weather tiles (e.g., processing, downloading, error).
This debug information is available only when the Development Plugin is enabled.
The 'IObtainValueAsyncCallback' is updated to provide the request time, enabling more accurate tracking of forecast data.
