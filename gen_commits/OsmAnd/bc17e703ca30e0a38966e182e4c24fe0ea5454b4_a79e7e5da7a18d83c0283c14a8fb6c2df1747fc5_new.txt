fix: Refine MediaCommandPlayerImpl audio focus callback

The onAudioFocusChange callback no longer automatically calls playQueue() on AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN,
and instead logs a generic error for any focus change.
This adjusts how the player reacts to audio focus changes, suggesting specific reactions
are handled elsewhere or are not expected in this context.
Also, added Javadoc for AudioFocusHelper and slightly simplified abandonFocus.
