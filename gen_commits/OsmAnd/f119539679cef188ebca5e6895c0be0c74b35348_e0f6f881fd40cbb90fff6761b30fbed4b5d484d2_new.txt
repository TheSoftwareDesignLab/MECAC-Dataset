feat: Add file import for routing and settings profiles

Enables users to import custom routing profiles (.xml) and application settings profiles (.osf) from local storage.

- Centralizes file import logic in `ImportHelper`.
- Adds new UI options in settings and profile management screens for importing these files.
- Registers intent filters to allow OsmAnd to open `.xml` and `.osf` files directly.
- Automatically renames imported files with numeric suffixes to prevent conflicts.
- Refactors profile selection to support handling of newly imported profiles.
