refactor: Remove redundant generalDisplayItem from TrackSegmentFragment

The generalDisplayItem field was removed as its data could be fetched
directly when needed. This simplifies the fragment by removing an
unnecessary state variable.
Map location and point description now retrieve data directly from
getGpx().findPointToShow() and getGpxDataItem().getFile().getName().
