refactor: Use NativeUtilities for pixel to LatLon conversions

Migrate calls to `getLatLonFromPixel` in `MapActivity` to `NativeUtilities.getLatLonFromPixel`. This delegates map coordinate calculations to native code, improving performance and accuracy by leveraging the `MapRenderer`.

Imports were also reordered for consistency.
