fix(quickaction): Enhance location simulation dialog display

Standardized the display of cutoff distance values by applying `OsmAndFormatter.getFormattedDistance` for improved readability and localization.
Refined the layout of the quick action dialog with improved padding, the addition of an "Options" header, and updated visual dividers for a clearer and more consistent user interface.
Corrected a typo in `CUTOF_STEP_SIZE` to `CUTOFF_STEP_SIZE`.
