fix: Prevent map recentering when moving slowly

The map previously re-centered continuously when linked to location, even if the user's speed was very low. This could lead to unnecessary and potentially jerky map movements. This change ensures the map only recenters when linked to location and the speed is above a small threshold, improving tracking stability.
