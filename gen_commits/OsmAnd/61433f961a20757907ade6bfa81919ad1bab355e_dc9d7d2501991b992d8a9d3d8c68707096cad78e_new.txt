feat: Implement new native library loading with fallback

Introduces a mechanism to load either a new or old native OsmAnd library.
The application now attempts to load the 'new' library (primarily OsmAndJNI) first. If loading fails, it falls back to the 'old' library (requiring Qt5Core, OsmAndCore, etc.).
A `newLibrary` flag is passed to NativeLibrary instances, enabling future conditional logic based on the loaded core.
Also removes the `metricsAndConstantsPreference` from general settings and streamlines native library loading in `BinaryInspectorNative`.
