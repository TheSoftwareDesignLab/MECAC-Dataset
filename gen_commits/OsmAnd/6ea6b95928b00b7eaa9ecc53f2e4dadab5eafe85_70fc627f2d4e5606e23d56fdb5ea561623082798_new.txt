feat: Implement scroll-hide header for GPX split segments

Refactor GPX split segments screen layout to move the interval selection
header from a ListView header to an overlaid view. This change enables a
scroll listener to dynamically hide and show the header as the list is
scrolled, improving screen real estate and interaction.
