perf: Optimize favorite point rendering with collision detection

Implements a collision detection mechanism for favorite point icons on the map.
Uses a QuadTree to identify and manage overlapping favorite points.
When points are close and would overlap, a smaller, generic icon (`map_white_shield_small`) is drawn to reduce visual clutter. Full favorite icons are drawn only for non-overlapping points, improving map readability and rendering performance in dense areas.
