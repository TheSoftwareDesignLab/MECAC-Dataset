feat: Implement flexible vehicle parameters handling

Refactor vehicle dimension settings to support multiple vehicle types and dynamic metric conversions.

This change introduces a new `vehiclesize` package with an extensible architecture to manage vehicle parameters (width, height, length, weight) for different profiles like Car, Truck, Motorcycle, and Boat.

Key improvements:
- Unifies parameter definition and validation logic across vehicle types.
- Dynamically converts and displays units (meters, feet, yards, tons, kilograms) based on the user's selected metric system.
- Provides robust input validation, including specific rules like truck weight limits.
- Decouples UI presentation from business logic, making `SizePreference` and `VehicleParametersBottomSheet` simpler and more maintainable.
- Replaces the monolithic `VehicleSizeAssets` with modular `Assets`, `Limits`, and `ThemedIconId` wrappers.
