feat: Navigate to specific map marker group in dialog

Introduces functionality to open the Map Markers Groups screen and automatically scroll to a particular marker group. Previously, only opening the groups screen was possible without specific group navigation.

This is achieved by:
- Updating `MapActivity.launchMapActivityMoveToTop` to accept a Bundle for intent extras.
- Passing a group ID (using `MARKERS_SYNC_GROUP_ID` constant) within the Bundle to `MapMarkersDialogFragment`.
- `MapMarkersGroupsFragment` now uses this ID to locate and scroll to the corresponding group header in its list.
