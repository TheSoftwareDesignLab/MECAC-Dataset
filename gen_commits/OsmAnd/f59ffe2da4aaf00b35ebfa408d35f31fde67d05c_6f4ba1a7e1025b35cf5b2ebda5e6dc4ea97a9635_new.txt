refactor: Redesign Configure Screen with card-based UI

Moves ConfigureScreenFragment and related dialogs to a new `dialogs` package.
Rebuilds the Configure Screen UI using a modular card-based approach,
introducing dedicated layouts for buttons, widgets, and actions,
and a shared header for these cards.
This improves code organization and reusability of UI components.
