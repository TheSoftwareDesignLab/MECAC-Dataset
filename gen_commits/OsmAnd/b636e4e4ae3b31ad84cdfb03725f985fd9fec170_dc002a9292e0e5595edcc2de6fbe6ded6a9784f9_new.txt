feat: Redesign point editor's icon, color, and shape selection

Refactored `PointEditorFragmentNew` to introduce dedicated UI components for selecting icons, colors, and shapes using `FlowLayouts`.
Replaced `point_editor_circle_button.xml` with a new generic `point_editor_button.xml`.
Renamed `FavouritePoint.BackType` enum to `BackgroundType` and updated all usages.
Standardized layout IDs from `outlineCircle`/`backgroundCircle` to `outline`/`background` in relevant layouts.
Corrected a typo from "sqare" to "square" in `BackgroundType` enum.
Adjusted padding and added background to name/description input fields for improved aesthetics.
