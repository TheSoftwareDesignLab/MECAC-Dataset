feat: Make 'Show on map' row clickable in Save GPX dialog

The entire row for the "Show on map after saving" option in the Save GPX
dialog now toggles the switch when clicked, improving usability.

Also, updated warning text to use a consistent color_warning and applied
theme-based text color for the toggle label.
