fix: Refine track map adjustment and zoom handling

Optimize map adjustment in `TrackMenuFragment` to only fit the map to a track
rectangle if it is not already fully visible, preventing redundant map movements.

Additionally, disable the explicit 'zoom in' functionality in `MenuController`,
likely to align with the improved automatic map fitting behavior for tracks.
