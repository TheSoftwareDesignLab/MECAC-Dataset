fix(zoom): Improve target pixel scale calculation

The previous calculation for `targetPixelScale` using a bit shift with `Math.max(deltaZoom, 0)` would incorrectly result in a scale of 1 when `deltaZoom` was negative or zero.
This prevented the widget from accurately reflecting zoom-out scales. The new `Math.pow` calculation correctly handles both zoom-in and zoom-out scenarios.
