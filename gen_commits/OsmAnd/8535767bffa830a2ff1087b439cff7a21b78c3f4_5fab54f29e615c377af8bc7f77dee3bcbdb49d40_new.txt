feat: Add line smoothness setting to data extraction

Introduce a new "Line smoothness for low zooms" preference (values 0-3).
This setting allows controlling the simplification of map ways during data generation.
The UI in OsmExtractionPreferencesDialog has been updated to include this option.

Also:
- Update default map zoom levels for data extraction from "5-8;9-11;12-14;15" to "8-10;11-12;13-14;15".
- Fix basemap file filtering logic in MapRenderRepositories to correctly exclude/include basemaps based on the `basemapSearch` flag.
