fix(ui): Ensure search radius dialogs update and improve UI consistency

* Added `notifyDataSetInvalidated()` calls to ensure waypoint search radius dialogs update correctly.
* Increased vertical margins for radius search and waypoint header list elements from 3dp to 5dp.
* Updated "Search Radius" text to "Search Radius Proximity" for better clarity.
* Implemented closing the options menu drawer when a 'Back' header is clicked in Configure Map.
