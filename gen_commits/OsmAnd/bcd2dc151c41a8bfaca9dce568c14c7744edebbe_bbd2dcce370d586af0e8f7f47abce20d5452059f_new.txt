refactor: Unify context menu list adapter creation

Removes the redundant `createSimpleListAdapter` method. Its specific icon
styling logic, including theme-based coloring for simple list items,
has been integrated into the `createListAdapter` method's `getView` logic.
MapActivity now sets the default layout ID and calls the unified adapter creator.
