feat: Rework cloud backup progress and add logout confirmation

Introduces a new `LogoutBottomSheet` for a confirmed logout from OsmAnd Cloud,
improving user experience and preventing accidental logouts.

Enhances cloud backup progress reporting with:
- Calculation and display of estimated backup sizes for individual items and overall progress in KB and percentages.
- New `getDirectorySize` utility for accurate folder size calculation.
- Improved UI for backup status, including dynamic divider visibility and refined progress bar updates.

Refactors backup-related UI layouts (dividers, padding) for consistency.
Updates `ChoosePlanFragment` and `TroubleshootingCard` to integrate with the new `AuthorizeFragment` for promo code redemption, streamlining the subscription process.
