refactor: Add 'stop' event to map scrolling for precise control

Removed the `scrollMap` method and inlined its logic into `onTrackballEvent` and
`onScrollEvent`. The `ScrollHelper` now includes a `stop` parameter in its
`onScrollEvent` listener, allowing `MapActivity` to differentiate between
ongoing map movement and the final position when scrolling ceases. This enables
more granular map control and positioning, such as using `renderer.setTarget`
for continuous movement and `setMapLocation` to finalize position on stop.
