refactor: Unify fragment theme and fullscreen handling

- Use `UiUtilities.getInflater` for consistent view inflation based on theme.
- Pass `nightMode` to `UiUtilities.setupDialogButton` for correct button styling.
- Refactor `isFullScreenAllowed` logic to centralize fullscreen control for fragments.
- Add top padding to profile list RecyclerView to account for removed status bar padding.
