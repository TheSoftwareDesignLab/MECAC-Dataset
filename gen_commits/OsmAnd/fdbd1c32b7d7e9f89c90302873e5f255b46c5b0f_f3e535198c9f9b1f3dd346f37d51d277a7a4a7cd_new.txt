refactor: Remove 'markersListOpened' state and simplify controls visibility

The `markersListOpened` state in `MapMarkersLayer` was redundant as `PlanRouteFragment` already managed this state internally. This change removes the field and associated methods.

Consequently, the `isInExpandedRouteMode()` check has been removed from `MapControlsLayer`. This simplifies the visibility conditions for map zoom controls and the "back to location" button, making them more consistently available during plan route mode unless a primary route dialog is active.
