refactor: Use specific string for 'Directions to' menu item

Updates the string resource for the "Directions to" menu item across
NavigatePointFragment, SearchAddressFragment, and SearchByNameAbstractActivity.
Replaces `R.string.get_directions` with `R.string.context_menu_item_directions_to`
for better context and consistency.
