feat: Add new POI strings and reformat phrases.xml

Adds a variety of new Point of Interest (POI) string resources, including:
- Additional shop categories (spices, craft, honey, religious goods).
- Specific fuel types for aircraft and boats.
- Expanded landuse categories (residential, commercial, retail).
- New sports (ice hockey).
- Detailed internet access options (fee charged/no fee).
- More club types (Masonic Lodge, sailing, scout).
- A comprehensive list of new Wikipedia language links.
- Filters for dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, kosher, halal, lactose-free).
- Filters for services like takeaway, delivery, outdoor seating, and showers.
- Strings for bicycle charging and repair stations, diaper table count, and palliative medicine.

The commit also includes extensive reformatting of the `phrases.xml` file, primarily re-indenting many existing POI strings to improve readability and consistency, and moving some strings to group related items more logically.
