feat: Add integrated on-map Audio/Video/Photo recording UI

Introduces a new, integrated UI for audio, video, and photo recording directly on the map screen, replacing previous dialog-based capture methods.
The UI provides a live camera viewfinder, record/stop/shoot buttons, and a duration timer, adaptable for both portrait and landscape modes.
Adds new settings for video quality and audio format/bitrate, and handles screen orientation locking during camera operations.
