feat: Add ka strings for speed cameras, limits, and toll roads

This commit introduces new string resources for the Georgian locale (`values-ka`).
These strings enable the display of speed cameras and speed limits,
and provide options to avoid toll roads in navigation settings.
Also includes a string for a recent changes tip.
