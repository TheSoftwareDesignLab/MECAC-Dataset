refactor(i18n): Rename shared_string_gpx_files to shared_string_tracks

This commit renames the string resource identifier `shared_string_gpx_files` to `shared_string_tracks` across all localization files and corresponding Java code references.

This change improves the clarity and consistency of terminology in the UI by using "Tracks" as the primary term for recorded routes. Descriptions related to waypoints are also updated for consistency.
