feat: Introduce new speedometer widget with configurable speed limit

This commit adds a new speedometer widget to the map screen. Key features include:
- Displaying current GPS speed.
- Showing the current speed limit with configurable warning states (always or only when exceeded).
- Support for different regional speed limit sign styles (e.g., USA).
- Configurable widget size (medium, large) via a dedicated settings screen.
- Integration into the "Configure screen" -> "Other widgets" for activation.
