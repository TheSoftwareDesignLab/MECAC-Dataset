feat: Rework widget settings and add widget UI

Introduced `WidgetInfoBaseFragment` as a base for individual widget settings.
Redesigned `AddWidgetFragment` to use a modern `CoordinatorLayout` and `Toolbar`.
Changed widget addition to a single-selection flow, adding the widget immediately upon selection.
Added options to duplicate and delete widgets from their settings screen.
Updated `base_widget_fragment_layout.xml` to a Material Design approach.
Improved widget height configuration with radio buttons in `resizable_widget_setting.xml`.
