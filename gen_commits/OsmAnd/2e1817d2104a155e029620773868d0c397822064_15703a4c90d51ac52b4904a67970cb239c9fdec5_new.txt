feat: Redesign application profile selection in settings

Replaced the application mode spinner in settings with a custom selection button. Tapping the button now opens a dialog for choosing application profiles, enhancing user experience and visual clarity.
Also removed the getMapIconsSetId() method from ApplicationMode and added a debug log for GPX selection.
