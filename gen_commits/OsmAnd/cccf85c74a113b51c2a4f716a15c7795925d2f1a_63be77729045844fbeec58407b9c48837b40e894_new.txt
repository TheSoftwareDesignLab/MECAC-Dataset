feat: Introduce Android MapActivity with real-time location

- Implements `MapActivity` as the main entry point for the Android map application.
- Integrates Android location services (GPS/Network) to display the user's current position and accuracy.
- Adds `OsmandMapTileView` for map rendering and `PointOfView` for visualizing the user's location.
- Refactors `IMapLocationListener` to include an `Object source` parameter, enabling distinction between map interaction and location updates.
- Includes UI elements like zoom controls and a "back to location" button.
- Adds necessary Android permissions for location access in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- Replaces the deprecated `StartActivity`.
