fix: Pass single-touch events when multi-touch is inactive

Previously, MultiTouchSupport consumed single-pointer events (return true)
even when not in an active multi-touch gesture. This prevented other
map listeners from handling single-touch actions like scrolling or tapping.

Now, single-pointer events are only consumed if they conclude a multi-touch
gesture. Otherwise, they are passed on (return false) for normal map
interaction. Also, removed premature event discarding for DOWN/UP/CANCEL.
