fix: Improve pressed state feedback for coordinate input keyboard

The coordinate input keyboard buttons now correctly reflect their pressed state during touch interactions.
Previously, only the background color was manually set, bypassing the View's built-in state management.
This update explicitly calls 'setPressed(true)' and 'setPressed(false)', enabling proper functionality of StateListDrawables (e.g., ripple effects) and ensuring consistent visual feedback.
Minor refactoring includes switching to a 'switch' statement in the touch listener and renaming 'setNormalBackground' to 'setupNormalState' for improved readability.
