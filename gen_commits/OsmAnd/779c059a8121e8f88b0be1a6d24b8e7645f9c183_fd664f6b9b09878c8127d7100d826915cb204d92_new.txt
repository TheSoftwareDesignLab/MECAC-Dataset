fix: Weather: Reset animation start and improve minute precision

After playing, the weather forecast animation now returns the time slider
to its initial position instead of staying at the end of the sequence.

Improved the accuracy of minute calculation in the time slider and its
labels by using Math.round() instead of integer truncation. Corrected an
internal comment regarding the "today" time slider step size.
