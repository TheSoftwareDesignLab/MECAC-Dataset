feat: Smooth multi-touch gestures and prevent scroll conflicts

Improved multi-touch (pinch-to-zoom/rotate) gestures by averaging touch
points over time, resulting in a smoother user experience.

Disabled single-finger scrolling during active multi-touch gestures to
prevent conflicts. Integrated scroll distances for more accurate fling
behavior after map scrolling.
