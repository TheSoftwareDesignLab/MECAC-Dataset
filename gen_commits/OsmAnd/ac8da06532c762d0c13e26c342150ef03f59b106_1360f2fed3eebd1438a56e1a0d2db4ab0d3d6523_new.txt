refactor: Apply lambdas and enhance back press in QuickSearch

Converted anonymous inner class listeners to lambda expressions.
Improved `onBackButtonPressed` logic to hide the keyboard and clear search text when the tab bar is hidden.
Reordered imports and added `@NonNull` annotation to `onViewCreated` view parameter.
