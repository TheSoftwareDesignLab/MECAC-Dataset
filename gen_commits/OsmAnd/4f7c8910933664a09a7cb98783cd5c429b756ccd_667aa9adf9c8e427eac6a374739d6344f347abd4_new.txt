fix: Store center ratios and correct shift check

Introduces `ratiocx` and `ratiocy` fields in `RotatedTileBox` to explicitly store
the center point as a ratio of the tile box dimensions.
Updates `isCenterShifted()` to use these new ratio fields, ensuring a correct
comparison against `0.5f` for detecting if the center is shifted from the default.
Previously, absolute pixel coordinates `cx` and `cy` were incorrectly compared
against `0.5f`.
