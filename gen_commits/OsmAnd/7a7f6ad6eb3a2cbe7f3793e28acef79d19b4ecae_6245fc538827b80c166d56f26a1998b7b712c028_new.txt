feat: Enhance voice guidance with dedicated VoiceRouter

Introduced `VoiceRouter` class to centralize and improve voice guidance logic. `RoutingHelper` now utilizes `VoiceRouter` to deliver navigation prompts dynamically, with distances adapting to `ApplicationMode`.

- Corrected turn angle calculation in `RouteProvider` for better accuracy.
- `CommandPlayer` updated with new commands for route recalculation, arrival, and more precise turns.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` updated to version 0.2.3 (code 6) and debuggable set to false.
- Added `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` for `ShowRouteInfoActivity` intent in `MapActivity`.
