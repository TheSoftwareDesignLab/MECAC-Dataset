fix: Improve favorite tap detection accuracy

Refine the logic for selecting a favorite point when the map is tapped.
Instead of a generic square radius, the tap is now checked against the
actual bounding box of the favorite icon. If multiple icons overlap
and are hit, the favorite closest to the tap point is selected.
This provides a more precise and intuitive user experience.
