refactor: Decouple SearchUICore initialization

Moved SearchUICore initialization logic, including search indexes, out of the constructor.
The constructor now initializes SearchSettings with an empty list, and the explicit `init()` method is called later to finalize setup, allowing for more flexible dependency management.
