fix(map): Improve double-tap zoom sensitivity and gesture handling

- Increased `DP_PER_1X` from 100 to 200, making double-tap-and-drag zoom less sensitive.
- Corrected `DoubleTapScaleDetector` to pass the actual accumulated scale to `onZoomEnded`, ensuring the final zoom value is accurate.
- Adjusted touch event processing order in `OsmandMapTileView` to prioritize multi-touch, then allow double-tap scale and general gestures to process.
