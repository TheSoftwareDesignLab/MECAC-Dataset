refactor: Improve POI layer item update in Configure Map menu

The `selectPOILayer` method now directly updates the POI layer's ContextMenuItem properties (selected state, description, color) upon the POI filter selection dialog dismissal. This provides an immediate and accurate UI reflection of the selected POI filter.
Additionally, the GPX layer selection dialog invocation has been extracted into a new private method `showGpxSelectionDialog()` for improved code organization.
