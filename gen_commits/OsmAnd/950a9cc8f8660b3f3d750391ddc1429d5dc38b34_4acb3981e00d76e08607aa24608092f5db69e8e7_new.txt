refactor: Simplify NavigationService to use continuous GPS

Removed complex interval-based GPS tracking, AlarmManager, and WakeLock usage.
The NavigationService now consistently requests continuous location updates,
streamlining its implementation and removing legacy workarounds for API >= 19
alarm restrictions. The 'interval' parameter has been removed.
