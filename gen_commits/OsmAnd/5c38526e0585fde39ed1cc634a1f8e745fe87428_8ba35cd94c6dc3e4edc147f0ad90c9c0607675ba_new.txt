fix(measurement): Improve track rendering and UI controls

Adjusts the drawing logic for measurement tool track segments.
- Reorders segment drawing in `onPrepareBufferImage` for correct layering.
- Prevents redundant drawing of 'before'/'after' paths in `onDraw` when in approximation mode.
- Standardizes UI element visibility handling using `AndroidUiHelper.updateVisibility` for toolbar items.
- Changes "Apply" button text to "Continue" in the snap track warning dialog.
