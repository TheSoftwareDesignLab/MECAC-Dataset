feat: Implement functional search for amenities by type

Re-implements the SearchAmenityByTypeAPI to actively perform a search
for POIs using `BinaryMapIndexReader` and `SearchPoiTypeFilter`.
This enables accurate location-based searches for amenities based
on their category and subcategory.

Also includes:
- Refined bounding box calculation for POI search.
- Enabled location check in `SearchCityByLocationAPI`.
- Standardized name retrieval with `getName(lang, true)`.
- Increased preferred zoom for building results to 17.
