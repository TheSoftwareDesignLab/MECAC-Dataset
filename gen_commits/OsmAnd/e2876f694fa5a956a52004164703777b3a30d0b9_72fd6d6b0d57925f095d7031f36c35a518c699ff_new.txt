fix: Improve route planning panel layout in landscape

Correctly applies the landscape width dimension for the route planning panel,
addressing an issue where the wrong height dimension was used for width.
Also, increases the panel's width on large screens and ensures the scroll view
fills its viewport to prevent content clipping. Adjusts panel gravity
for consistent left alignment.
