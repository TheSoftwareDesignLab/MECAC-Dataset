refactor: Update bottom sheet switch item layout and styling

Rename bottom_sheet_item_with_switch_outlined.xml to bottom_sheet_item_with_switch_and_descr.xml.
Add line spacing to the description TextView for improved readability.
Dynamically apply backgrounds to bottom sheet switch items, allowing for specific styling like a stroke on the 'Show on map' switch.
