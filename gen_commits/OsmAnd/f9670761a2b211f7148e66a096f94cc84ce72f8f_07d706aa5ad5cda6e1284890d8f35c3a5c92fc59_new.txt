feat: Provide connected app list with names and icons

Introduces a new public method, `getConnectedApps()`, in OsmandAidlApi.
This method returns a sorted list of all AIDL-connected applications,
enriched with their display names and icons retrieved from PackageManager.
This allows for a more user-friendly display of connected apps.
Also refactors the `loadConnectedApps` call to the AIDL API constructor.
