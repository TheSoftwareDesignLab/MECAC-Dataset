feat: Introduce NetworkRouteDrawable for enhanced route symbols

Refactor how network route icons are displayed by introducing `NetworkRouteDrawable`. This new drawable handles rendering of OSMC text, background, and foreground icons for network routes, leveraging rendering rules for text styling.

- Refactor `NetworkRouteMenuController` to use `NetworkRouteDrawable` for displaying route icons.
- Enhance `RouteInfoCard` to display additional network route details like symbol, website, and Wikipedia links.
- Extract `TextDrawInfo` class into its own file for improved modularity.
- Adjust icon dimensions in `menu_obj_list_item.xml` and `track_menu.xml` to use `wrap_content` with `minWidth`/`minHeight` and add default tinting.
- Make `RenderingRuleProperty` type constants public for broader access.
