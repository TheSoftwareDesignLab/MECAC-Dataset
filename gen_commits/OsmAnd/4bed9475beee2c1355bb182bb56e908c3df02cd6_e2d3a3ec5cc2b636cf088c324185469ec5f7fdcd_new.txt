refactor: Simplify InAppPurchaseListener with default methods

Refactor InAppPurchaseListener to use default method implementations, reducing boilerplate in fragments. Removed redundant empty implementations for listener methods across various UI components (e.g., backup, download, widget fragments).

Also includes:
* Relocated `ShowHideMapillaryAction` to its plugin package.
* Added `@NonNull` annotations to `OsmandApplication` parameters in Quick Actions.
* Minor code cleanup and logic adjustments in Weather plugin related actions and settings.
