feat: Add scroll to actions button in GPS filter screen

The "Scroll to actions" button in the GPS filter toolbar now smoothly scrolls the currently active card (filters or graph) to its header, bringing the action buttons into view.

This involved:
- Adding `softScrollToActionCard()` to `GpsFilterBaseCard`.
- Refactoring `GpsFilterScreensAdapter` to store `GpsFilterBaseCard` objects directly, allowing invocation of card-specific methods.
- Connecting the toolbar button to the adapter's new scroll method.
