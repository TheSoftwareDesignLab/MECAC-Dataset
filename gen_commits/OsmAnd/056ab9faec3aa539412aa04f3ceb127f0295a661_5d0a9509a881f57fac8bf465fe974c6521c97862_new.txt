refactor: Remove explicit AV notes record control visibility refresh

Removes redundant calls to `setExplicitlyVisible()`, `MapInfoLayer.recreateControls()`,
and `MapView.refreshMap()` when the audio/video notes record control
starts or stops recording. These actions are likely handled by the widget's
own lifecycle, preventing unnecessary UI updates and potential refresh issues.
