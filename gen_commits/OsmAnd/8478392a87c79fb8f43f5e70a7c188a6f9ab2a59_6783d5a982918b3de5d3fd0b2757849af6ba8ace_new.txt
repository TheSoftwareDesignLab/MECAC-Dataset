style: Standardize text and list view appearance across search UI

Apply `@style/WhiteText` to various TextViews in list items and search layouts.
Configure ListViews with `cacheColorHint` to prevent flickering during scrolling and `divider` for clear visual separation.
Set background for the TabWidget in `SearchActivity`.
