feat: Reset map widget settings when disabled for a specific mode

Introduces a mechanism to reset a map widget's associated settings preference when the widget is disabled for a specific application mode.

The new `getWidgetSettingsPrefToReset()` method in `MapWidget` allows widgets to specify a preference that should be reset. When `enableDisableForMode()` is called with `enabled = false`, the specified preference will have its mode value reset to default.

This ensures that widget-specific configurations do not persist when the widget is inactive. The Radius Ruler widget's mode is now reset when it is disabled.
