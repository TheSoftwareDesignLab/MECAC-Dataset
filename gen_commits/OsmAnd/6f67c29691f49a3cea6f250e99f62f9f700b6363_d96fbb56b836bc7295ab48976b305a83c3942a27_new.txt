feat: Allow route line customization per routing profile

Introduces a "Customize route line" option accessible from the route options
bottom sheet and general navigation settings. This feature enables users
to define specific route line appearance settings for each application mode.

All route line appearance parameters, including color, width, coloring type,
and info attribute, are now saved and retrieved based on the active application
mode. The map theme within the customization fragment is also mode-specific.

Ensures that the navigation/route calculation process is not interrupted
when entering or exiting the route line customization screen.
