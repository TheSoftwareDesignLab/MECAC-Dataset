perf: Make Wikivoyage navigation map loading async

Move the generation of the Wikivoyage navigation map to an AsyncTask to
prevent UI freezes when opening the bottom sheet. A progress indicator
is shown while loading, and the UI is updated once the map is ready.
Synchronize `getNavigationMap` for thread safety.
