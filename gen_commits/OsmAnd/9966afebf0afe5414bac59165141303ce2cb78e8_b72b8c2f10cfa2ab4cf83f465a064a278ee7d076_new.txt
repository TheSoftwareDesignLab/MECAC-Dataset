refactor: Adjust point selection and map launch flow

- Switched context menu actions for intermediate/destination points from
  `navigatePointDialogAndLaunchMap` to direct `targets.navigateToPoint` calls.
- Re-enabled `MapActivity.launchMapActivityMoveToTop` calls after adding or setting
  navigation points to ensure the map is consistently brought to the foreground.
- This streamlines point management and relates to Issue 1929.
