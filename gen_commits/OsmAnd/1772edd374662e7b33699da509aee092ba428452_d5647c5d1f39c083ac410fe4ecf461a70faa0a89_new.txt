feat: Use full duration format for accessibility

Introduces a `fullForm` parameter to `Algorithms.formatDuration`.
When `accessibilityEnabled()` is true, durations are formatted with hours,
minutes, and seconds (e.g., "00:05:30" instead of "05:30"), providing a
consistent format that is easier for screen readers and users who require
more explicit time representation.

This change is applied to various parts of the app including GPX track
analysis, Audio/Video Notes, Route information, OsMo connection status,
and routing helper messages.

Also adjusts the display of zero-distance segments in the route info
activity to explicitly state "arrived at intermediate point" or
"arrived at destination" and clear distance/time labels, improving clarity.
