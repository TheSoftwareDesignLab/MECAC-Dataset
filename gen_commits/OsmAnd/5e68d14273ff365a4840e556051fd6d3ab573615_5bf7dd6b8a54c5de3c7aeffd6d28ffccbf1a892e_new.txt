feat: Implement grouped custom radio button styling for tabs

Refactored custom radio button layouts into reusable components.
Introduced `UiUtilities.CustomRadioButtonTypeGroup` enum and `updateCustomRadioButtonsGroup` method for dynamic styling of segmented controls.
Applied this new styling to GPX item tabs to display them as a visually cohesive grouped radio button set, dynamically updating their appearance on selection.
