fix(parking-point): Respect light content setting for dialog theme

The logic for determining the dialog's theme in `showAddParkingDialog` was simplified.
It now relies solely on `app.getSettings().isLightContent()`, removing the additional check for day/night mode.
This ensures that the user's explicit light content preference is consistently applied to the parking options dialog.
