refactor: Rename system theme methods for clarity

Renamed `*SystemDefaultTheme` methods to `*SystemTheme` (e.g., `isSupportSystemDefaultTheme` to `isSupportSystemTheme`).
This improves clarity and conciseness in theme-related settings.
Also removed unused imports in `GeneralProfileSettingsFragment`.
