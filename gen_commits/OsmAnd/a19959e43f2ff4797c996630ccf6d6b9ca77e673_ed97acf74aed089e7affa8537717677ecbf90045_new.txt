fix: Prevent UI updates during route marker drag and scroll

Introduces a flag to disallow UI updates while route markers in the
PlanRouteFragment are being dragged or the RecyclerView is scrolling.
This prevents potential IllegalStateExceptions or visual inconsistencies
when the UI attempts to update during transient RecyclerView states.
