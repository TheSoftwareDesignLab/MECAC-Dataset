feat: Add unified Terrain layer management screen

Introduces a dedicated fragment for managing the terrain layer, which
encompasses both Hillshade and Slope views. Users can now enable/disable
the terrain layer, switch between Hillshade and Slope modes, and adjust
transparency settings from a single interface.

- Added `TerrainFragment` and `fragment_terrain.xml` for the UI.
- Introduced `TERRAIN` and `TERRAIN_MODE` preferences in OsmandSettings.
- Integrated into the map dashboard and context menu for easy access.
