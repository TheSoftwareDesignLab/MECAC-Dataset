fix(map): Improve map movement animation and pixel precision

Removed redundant 'needMove' parameter from `showOnMap`, simplifying map movement logic.
Ensured pixel coordinate calculations use float division for better precision.
Prevented new map animations from starting if an animation is already active,
to avoid animation conflicts and visual glitches.
