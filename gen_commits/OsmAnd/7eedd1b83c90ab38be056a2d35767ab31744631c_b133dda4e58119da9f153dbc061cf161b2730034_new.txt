feat: Add adaptive layout for widget items without descriptions

Introduces `selectable_widget_item_no_description.xml` to display widgets concisely when they lack a description. The `AddWidgetFragment` now dynamically selects between this new layout and the standard layout.

Also includes:
- Corrected a typo in `selectable_widget_item.xml`.
- Standardized widget title text size in `base_widget_fragment_layout.xml`.
- Updated ripple drawable in `OsmandDarkTheme`.
