feat: Mark Altitude Map Center as a Pro widget

The ALTITUDE_MAP_CENTER widget is now included in the list of Pro widgets.
This change involves updating its promotional banner to link to the TERRAIN
subscription. The old conditional check within the `getGroup()` method for
the ALTITUDE widget has been removed, as its availability is now tied to
its Pro status.
