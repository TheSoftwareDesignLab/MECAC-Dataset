feat(fr): Add new rendering/route strings and refine descriptions

- Add new strings for rendering attributes (e.g., "No polygons", "Rendering mode") and route instructions (e.g., "Roundabout", "Keep left").
- Enhance `download_files_question` to display file size.
- Improve pluralization for `items_were_selected` (e.g., "objet(s)").
- Rephrase `settings_preset_descr` for better clarity and conciseness.
