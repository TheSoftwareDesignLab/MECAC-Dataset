feat: Add preference to control 'my location' map animation

Introduces a new user setting `animate_my_location` to enable or disable
the animation of the user's location on the map.

- When enabled (default), map movements, zoom, and rotation are animated.
- When disabled, map updates instantly by jumping to the new position,
  zoom, and rotation.
- `MapViewTrackingUtilities` now respects this setting.
- The `autozoom` method has been updated to return a `Pair<Integer, Double>`
  to support fractional zoom values for smoother animated transitions.
- `AnimateDraggingMapThread` adapted to handle fractional zoom and
  the new animation behavior.
