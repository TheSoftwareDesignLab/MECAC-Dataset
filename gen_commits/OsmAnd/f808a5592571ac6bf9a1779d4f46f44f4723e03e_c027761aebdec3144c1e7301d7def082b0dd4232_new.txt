feat: Add new weather map widgets

Introduces a comprehensive set of map widgets to display real-time weather data.
This includes dedicated widgets for:
- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Wind speed and direction
- Cloud cover
- Air pressure

The implementation involves:
- Defining new `WidgetType` enums and a `WEATHER` `WidgetGroup`.
- Adding corresponding string resources for widget descriptions.
- Integrating widget creation and visibility within `WeatherPlugin` and `ApplicationMode`.
- Implementing `WeatherWidget` as a base for displaying weather data.
- Introducing `Algorithms.equalsToAny` utility method to simplify widget type checks.
