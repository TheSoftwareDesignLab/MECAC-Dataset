feat: Improve GPX layer point rendering with collision detection

Implement collision detection for GPX track points on the map.
Overlapping points now render a smaller icon to reduce clutter,
while distinct points display full icons.
Refactors `calculateRect` to `OsmandMapLayer` and adds float
coordinate support to `FavoriteImageDrawable` for drawing.
