feat: Enhance Available RAM widget display and performance

Renamed "Allocated Memory" widget to "Available RAM" for better clarity.
Implemented `AndroidUtils.formatRatioOfSizes` to display memory usage consistently across locales (e.g., "100 MB / 200 MB").
Optimized widget updates to only refresh when memory values change and at a 1-second interval, reducing CPU usage.
Added dedicated icons for the Available RAM widget.
