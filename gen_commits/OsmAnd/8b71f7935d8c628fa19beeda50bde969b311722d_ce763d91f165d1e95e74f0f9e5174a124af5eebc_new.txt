fix: Avoid unreliable bearing for nav info at low speeds

Bearing data can be erratic when moving at very low speeds or stationary, leading to inaccurate relative directions and confusing auto-announcements. This change prevents the use of bearing information for these features when the device speed is below 0.5 m/s, improving the reliability of navigation feedback.

The `isSmallSpeedForCompass` utility method was made public and static to facilitate this check.
