refactor(map): Consolidate location requests and refine zoom controls

Extracted location update request and removal logic into `startLocationRequests()` and `stopLocationRequests()` methods within `MapActivity`.
Updated `RouteAnimation` to utilize these new methods for consistent handling of location updates.
Standardized zoom in/out operations in `MapControlsLayer` by introducing `ZOOM_DELTA` for more precise and consistent float zoom increments.
