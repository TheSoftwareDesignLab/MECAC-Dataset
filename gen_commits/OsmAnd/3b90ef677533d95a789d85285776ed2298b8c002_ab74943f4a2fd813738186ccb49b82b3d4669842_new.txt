feat: Support {bbox} parameter in tile URLs

Adds the ability to use the `{bbox}` placeholder in tile source URLs.
This placeholder will be replaced with the geographic bounding box of the
requested tile, formatted as "xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax". This enhances flexibility
for tile sources that require bounding box coordinates instead of standard x, y, z.
