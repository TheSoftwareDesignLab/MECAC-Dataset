refactor: Move elevation profile widget to dedicated bottom bar

The elevation profile widget has been relocated from map_hud_bottom.xml
(both landscape and portrait) to a new map_bottom.xml layout. This new
layout is now included in main.xml after the main map content, providing
a dedicated, consistent bottom bar. The widget's layout_height was
updated to wrap_content and its background removed. A bottom shadow was
also added to main.xml for visual separation.
