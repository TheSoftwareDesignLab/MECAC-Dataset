refactor: Rework data extraction to directly create indexes

Replaced the old DataExtraction class, which first built a full Region object in memory, with a new IndexCreator that generates indexes directly from OSM input files. This change significantly reduces memory consumption and improves performance for large data sets.

The Region class is no longer a central dependency for index generation, and its nested CityComparator has been extracted into its own file (CityComparator.java).

The OsmExtractionUI has been updated to reflect this new process, removing UI elements related to displaying and manipulating the in-memory Region object, and focusing on configuring and initiating the direct index creation. Removed dead code and updated logging.
