refactor: Extract map HUD layout and streamline controls

The main MapHudLayout content was extracted from main.xml into a new dedicated map_hud_layout.xml.
The map_hud_quick_actions.xml was deleted and its QuickActionsWidget integrated directly into map_hud_layout.xml.
References to the main HUD container ID were updated from MapHudButtonsOverlay to map_hud_layout.
Simplifies button initialization in MapControlsLayer by directly referencing elements from the new layout.
