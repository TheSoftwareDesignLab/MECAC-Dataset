Migrate map context menu root layout to FrameLayout.
Wrap bottom content in a ScrollView and remove the bottom border view.
Refactor menu height and position calculation for smoother sliding animations.
Adjust half-screen height to 70% and set initial state for amenity info to half-screen.
Update button icon colors for consistency.
