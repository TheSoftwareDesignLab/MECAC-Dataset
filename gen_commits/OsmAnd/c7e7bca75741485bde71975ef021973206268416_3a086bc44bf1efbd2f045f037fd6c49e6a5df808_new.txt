feat: Support GPX files in search history and recents

This change introduces the ability to display and interact with GPX files
directly within the search history and dashboard recent items.

Key changes include:
- GPX files now appear in search history lists.
- Users can navigate to GPX files from the recents list, with segment
  selection for multi-segment tracks.
- Tapping on a GPX history entry opens the track menu.
- Refactored `SearchHistoryFragment` item updates, added GPX icon, and
  improved nullability annotations.
- Updated `DashBaseFragment` and `DashLocationFragment` with helper methods
  and better null handling.
