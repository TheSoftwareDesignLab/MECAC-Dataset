feat: Display slope legend image and enhance download progress

Adds a dedicated image for the slope legend within the Terrain fragment UI,
improving clarity and visual representation for users.

Refactors enum comparisons from `equals()` to `==` for improved
readability and idiomatic usage across TerrainFragment and TerrainLayer.

Implements `DownloadEvents` interface in TerrainFragment to provide
real-time download progress updates for terrain data items. This is achieved
by making `listAdapter` a class member and using it to update individual
`ContextMenuItem` progress listeners during active downloads.
