feat: Implement dedicated OBD device settings screen

A new `VehicleMetricsSettingsFragment` is introduced for managing OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) device connections. This separates connection logic from `OBDMainFragment`, which now focuses solely on displaying vehicle metrics.

Users can now:
- View paired Bluetooth OBD devices.
- Connect to a selected device.
- Disconnect from a connected device.

The `OBDDispatcher` is enhanced with a `stopReading()` method for cleaner resource management and improved handling of I/O streams. The `FUEL_LEFT_LITERS` data field and its UI elements have been removed.
