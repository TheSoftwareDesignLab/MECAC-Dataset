refactor: Enhance nearby places UI and image loading

- Adjust layout dimensions for nearby place items (height, margins, icon gravity).
- Consolidate list item dividers for consistency.
- Optimize image loading for photo galleries, deferring until views are expanded.
- Implement placeholder generation for nearby place images using icons.
