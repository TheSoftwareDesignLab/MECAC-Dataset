feat: Dynamically adjust map tilt angle based on zoom

The map tilt applied by the My Location button's tilt listener now varies
with the current map zoom level. This provides a more pronounced and
visually appealing tilt at higher zoom levels:
- Zoom < 14: 45 degrees
- Zoom < 16: 50 degrees
- Zoom < 17: 55 degrees
- Zoom >= 17: 60 degrees
