feat: Improve map animation smoothness and joining

Introduces a mechanism to allow map movement animations to smoothly join
an ongoing animation if it's already significantly progressed.

- Adds 'allowAnimationJoin' parameter to animation start methods.
- Tracks animation interpolation progress for determining join eligibility.
- Updates "back to my location" to use this feature for smoother
  transitions when repeatedly invoked.
- Refines animation time and initial zoom calculation based on new
  distance thresholds.
