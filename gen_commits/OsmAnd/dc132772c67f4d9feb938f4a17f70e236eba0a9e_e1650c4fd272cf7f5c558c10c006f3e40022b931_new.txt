fix: Prevent radius ruler compass text overlap

Adjust the drawing radius for distance and heading text associated with
compass circles in the Radius Ruler Control Layer. An offset (15dp for
horizontal, 20dp otherwise) is applied to position the text further
from the circle, improving readability and preventing visual overlap.
