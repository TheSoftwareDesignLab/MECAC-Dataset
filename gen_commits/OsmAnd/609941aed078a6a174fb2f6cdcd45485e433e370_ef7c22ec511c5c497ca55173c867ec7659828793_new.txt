feat(weather): Display forecast info on widget tap

Introduce a new feature to the Weather Widget that shows detailed forecast information when the widget is tapped. This functionality is enabled when the Development Plugin is active.

The displayed information includes:
- The specific time for which the weather forecast is generated.
- The last download time of the relevant forecast database file.
- The current status of the weather tiles (processing, downloading, error, or ready).

Also adds `.tiff.db` as a new constant for TIFF database file extensions.
