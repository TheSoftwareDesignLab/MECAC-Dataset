feat: Improve map preview animation

Introduces a dedicated `animateToPreview` method to handle map adjustments during
preview states. This allows for a smoother, sequenced animation including
azimuth, target, zoom, and elevation angle (set to 90 degrees).

Removed redundant compass mode and elevation angle settings from Android Auto
screens as the new animation logic now manages the desired map orientation.
Increased the preview animation duration from 1400ms to 1500ms for a slightly
extended visual experience.
