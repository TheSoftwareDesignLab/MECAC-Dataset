feat: Enhance favorite point small icon display with layers

Refactor small favorite point icon drawing to use a layered approach.
Icons are now composed of three separate layers (bottom, center, top).
The color filter is applied only to the 'center' layer, allowing for more
detailed and visually appealing icons where only specific parts are tinted.
Icons are pre-cached for improved performance.
