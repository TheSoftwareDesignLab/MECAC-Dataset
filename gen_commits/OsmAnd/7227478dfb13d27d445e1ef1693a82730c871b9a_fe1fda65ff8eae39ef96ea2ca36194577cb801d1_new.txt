refactor: Improve favorite category selection and input styling

- Migrate styling for new favorite category input field from programmatic calls to XML attributes.
- Enhance `SelectFavoriteCategoryBottomSheet` to display the currently selected category by passing `selectedCategory` parameter.
- Add null-check when adding GPX info to search history.
- Correctly display GPX category point counts in the selection dialog, showing "empty" for categories without points.
