refactor: Unify map icon rendering across layers

Migrate various map layers to use a centralized icon drawing system, `FavoriteImageDrawable`.
This refactoring involves:
- Standardizing icon asset naming (e.g., `map_*.png` to `ic_*.png`).
- Removing redundant and specific icon assets.
- Dynamically rendering icon backgrounds and foregrounds based on `FavouritePoint` properties.
- Simplifies icon management and improves visual consistency.
