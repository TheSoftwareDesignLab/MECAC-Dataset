refactor: Improve OsMo sign-in process

- Renamed `signin()` to `signinPost()` for clearer intent (displaying WebView).
- Renamed `signin2()` to `signin()` as the primary prompt.
- The new `signin()` now invokes `signinPost()` on user confirmation.
- Removed redundant explanatory text from the `signinPost()` dialog.
- Disabled the negative button in the initial sign-in prompt.
