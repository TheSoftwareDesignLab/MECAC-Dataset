feat(i18n): Add rendering attribute strings to Basque locale

Adds new strings for various map rendering attributes to OsmAnd's Basque locale
(`values-eu/strings.xml`). These strings, currently in English, will allow for
future translation of features like "No polygons", "Rendering mode", "Show
contour lines", and "Show more map detail".
