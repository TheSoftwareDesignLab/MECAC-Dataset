fix: Improve sharing status error detection and TDLib timeout

Reduce WAITING_TDLIB_TIME from 30s to 3s for faster feedback on TDLib processing.
Introduce `lastTextMessageProcessed` and `lastMapMessageProcessed` flags to track if sent messages have been processed by TDLib.
Update sharing status error logic to combine these new flags with the reduced timeout for more accurate error detection.
Corrected a typo from `pendingMapMessage` to `pendingTextMessage` in text message error handling.
