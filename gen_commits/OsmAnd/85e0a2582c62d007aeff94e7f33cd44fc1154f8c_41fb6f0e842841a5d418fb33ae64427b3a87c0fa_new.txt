fix: Handle off-screen coordinates in radius ruler layer

Ensure screen point conversion methods (e.g., `getPointFromCenterByRadius`) return null
when the calculated LatLon is outside valid map bounds. Add null checks for these
`PointF` results before drawing text, arrows, or compass lines to prevent drawing
artifacts or potential `NullPointerException`s.

Refactor text coordinate calculation and drawing logic for clarity and robustness,
utilizing `Pair<PointF, PointF>` and a new `drawTextWithCoords` helper.
Introduce `isLatLonOutOfScreen` helper for cleaner boundary checks.
