refactor: Standardize toolbar styling and layout for track selection

The `select_track_file_dialog_fragment.xml` toolbar now uses a new `ToolbarTitle` style for its title text appearance and a dimension resource for its content inset. The shadow view and RecyclerView are wrapped within a FrameLayout.
Introduced `ToolbarTitle` style in `styles.xml` to centralize toolbar title properties.
