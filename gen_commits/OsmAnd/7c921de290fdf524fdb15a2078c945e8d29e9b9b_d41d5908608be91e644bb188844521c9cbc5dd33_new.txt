fix: Preserve smooth zoom when setting main layer

Previously, the fractional zoom was always reset to 0 when `setMainLayer` was called. This update ensures that the current fractional zoom is maintained, unless the integer zoom falls outside the new layer's min/max bounds, in which case the fractional zoom is also reset.
