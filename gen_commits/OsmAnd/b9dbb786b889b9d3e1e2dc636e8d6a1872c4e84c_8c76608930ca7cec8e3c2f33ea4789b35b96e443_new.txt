feat: Allow single tap on map to toggle controls

Users can now tap on the map background to show or hide the map control
buttons. This functionality is disabled when navigation is active or paused,
or when the measurement or plan route tools are in use.

The change refactors map control visibility logic into `MapControlsLayer`
for centralized management and ensures controls are shown when relevant
map fragments are resumed.
