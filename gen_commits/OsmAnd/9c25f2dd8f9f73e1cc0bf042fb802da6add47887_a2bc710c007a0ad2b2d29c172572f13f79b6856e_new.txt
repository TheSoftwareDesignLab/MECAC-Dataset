fix(telegram): Robustly parse time from location messages

The previous approach for extracting the time substring from a location message could lead to an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the closing parenthesis was missing.

This change extracts all content from the opening parenthesis to the end of the string, and then explicitly removes the outer parentheses. This makes the time parsing more resilient to malformed input, specifically when the closing parenthesis is absent.
