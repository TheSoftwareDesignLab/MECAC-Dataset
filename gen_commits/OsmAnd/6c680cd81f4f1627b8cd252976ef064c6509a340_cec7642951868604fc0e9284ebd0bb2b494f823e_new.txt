feat: Add GeoTIFF support for heightmaps

Introduces full support for GeoTIFF (.tif) files for heightmaps. This includes:
- Defining the .tif extension and a dedicated GEOTIFF_DIR.
- Updating AndroidManifest to handle .tif files via intent filters.
- Integrating GeoTIFFs into the download manager, local index helper, and import functionality.
- Renaming the old SQLite heightmap type to HEIGHTMAP_FILE_LEGACY and hiding it from download lists,
  prioritizing GeoTIFF for new heightmap downloads.
