fix: Improve weather forecast layer updates during animation

Introduce `forAnimation` and `resetPeriod` parameters to weather plugin and raster layer methods.
The `resetPeriod` flag ensures the weather raster layer's data loading period is correctly recalculated, especially when switching forecast dates or starting an animation. This prevents potential issues where the layer might not load the full data range required for smooth animation or accurate display.
Adjusts the `timePeriodStart` and `timePeriodEnd` calculations in `WeatherRasterLayer` for more precise data loading during forecast animations.
