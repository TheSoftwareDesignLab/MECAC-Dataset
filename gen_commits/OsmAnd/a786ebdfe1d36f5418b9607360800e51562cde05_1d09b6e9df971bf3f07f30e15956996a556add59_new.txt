feat: Dynamically show/hide top shadow in bottom sheets

Adds dynamic top shadow handling to several bottom sheet dialog fragments.
A `ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener` is used to detect layout changes (e.g., keyboard visibility, content size). It then calculates if the content in the scroll view exceeds the available visible area and accordingly shows or hides a top shadow to indicate scrollability, improving user experience.
