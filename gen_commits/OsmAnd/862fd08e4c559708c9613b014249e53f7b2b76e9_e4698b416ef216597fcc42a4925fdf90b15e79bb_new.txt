refactor: Clean up UI and filter current user chat

Hides various placeholder description texts and an unused UI element across LiveNowTabFragment and MyLocationTabFragment. Fetches and stores the current Telegram user, then uses this information to exclude the user's own chat from the MyLocationTabFragment list.
