refactor(android-auto): Use CarContext for dark mode detection

Removed custom OsmandAndroidAutoTheme and its manifest declaration.
Adopted CarContext.isDarkMode() for determining day/night mode in Android Auto screens.
Updated DayNightHelper to reflect CarContext dark mode status during active car navigation.
This change standardizes dark mode handling and removes redundant theme definitions.
