fix: Synchronize map rotation animation duration

The rotation animation duration now considers the overall `animationDuration` of the map movement. This ensures the rotation animation lasts at least `ROTATION_MOVE_ANIMATION_TIME` but can be longer to match the map's general movement, preventing premature rotation completion and ensuring a smoother, more synchronized visual experience during map transitions.
