feat: Add compass mode selection dialog for widget and settings

Refactors 'Rotate Map' and 'Position on Map' preferences to use custom
dialogs and dedicated controllers. Introduces `CompassMode` enum to
manage map rotation options and icons. Enables long-press on the map
compass widget to quickly change mode via a new bottom sheet dialog.
