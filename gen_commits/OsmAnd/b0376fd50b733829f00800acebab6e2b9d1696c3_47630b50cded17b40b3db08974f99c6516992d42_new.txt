refactor(sk): Clarify routing service messages

Update Slovak strings for routing messages to improve clarity.
- Adjust phrasing for online routing connection from "you are trying to use" to "is selected".
- Emphasize temporary nature of fallback routing service for experimental offline routing from "automatically switched" to "temporarily switched".
