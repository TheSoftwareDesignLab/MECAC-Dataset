refactor: Unify and simplify scroll shadow implementation

Introduces a new generic `shadow.xml` drawable for consistency.
Replaces `bg_contextmenu_shadow_top_light` with `shadow.xml` across multiple bottom sheets and fragments.
Reduces the shadow height from 10dp to 8dp.
Refactors Java code to manage shadow visibility directly on the `buttons_shadow` view, removing `setForeground` usage.
