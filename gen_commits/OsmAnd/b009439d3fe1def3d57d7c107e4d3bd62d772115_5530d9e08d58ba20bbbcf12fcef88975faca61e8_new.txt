feat: Enhance BRouter integration with direct turn parsing

- Request OsmAnd-formatted turn instructions from BRouter.
- Parse BRouter's turn instructions directly using `parseOsmAndGPXRoute`.
- Introduce default speeds for different routing modes (foot, bicycle, motorcar).
- Improve average speed calculation in GPX route parsing using segment time.
- Prevent redundant turn generation when BRouter provides directions.
