fix: Apply night mode styling to custom radio button groups

Ensures that custom radio button groups, especially within GPX item pages, correctly apply night mode styling. Previously, the night mode parameter was not consistently passed, leading to incorrect theming.

This change involves:
- Refactoring `custom_radio_buttons.xml` by inlining its included button container layouts.
- Introducing a new generic layout `custom_radio_buttons_group.xml` for better reusability.
- Passing the `nightMode` boolean to `UiUtilities.updateCustomRadioButtonsGroup` calls.
- A minor adjustment to the inactive track color for sliders in `UiUtilities`.
