fix: Close drawer by tap when animations disabled

Implemented `dispatchTouchEvent` to allow closing the left navigation drawer by tapping outside its area. This functionality is specifically applied when the 'Do not use animations' setting is active, improving usability in this mode.

The assignment logic for the `animate` parameter in `openDrawer` and `closeDrawer` methods has been changed to directly reflect the `settings.DO_NOT_USE_ANIMATIONS` value, inverting its previous behavior.
