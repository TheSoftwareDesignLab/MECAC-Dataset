feat: Add dark mode support to splash screens

Refactors splash screen background colors to dynamically adapt to system theme settings.
Introduces a new `splash_screen_background_color` alias and `values-night` resources
to provide distinct light and dark theme backgrounds.
Updates the second splash screen fragment to use this dynamic theming
and centralizes splash screen styles under a new base theme.
The `isLightSystemDefaultTheme()` method is now public for broader theme detection.
