refactor: Remove MapHelper and simplify map centering

The `MapHelper` class has been deleted as its functionality for map adjustment and centering, specifically when showing a long-pressed marker, is no longer needed. The relevant logic in `ContextMenuLayer` now directly utilizes `AnimateDraggingMapThread`, streamlining the map interaction code and reducing unnecessary abstraction.
