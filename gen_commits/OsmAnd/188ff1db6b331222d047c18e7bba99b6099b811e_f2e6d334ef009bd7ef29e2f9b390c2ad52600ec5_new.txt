fix(cs): Improve and clarify Czech translations

Update various strings across the application to enhance clarity, consistency, and accuracy of the Czech localization.
This includes:
- Correcting terminology (e.g., "Supporters" to "Sponzorů").
- Clarifying descriptions for settings, tips, and search filters.
- Renaming UI elements (e.g., "Vrstvy" to "Mapová data", "OSM-Editing" to "Editace OSM").
- Translating previously unlocalized plugin descriptions.
