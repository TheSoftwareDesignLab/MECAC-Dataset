feat(routing): Allow custom names for online routing engines

This commit introduces the ability to assign custom names to online routing engines, enhancing user experience and customizability.

Refactors:
- `OnlineRoutingEngine` no longer directly stores the engine name; instead, it derives it from a `CUSTOM_NAME` parameter or generates a standard name.
- `OnlineRoutingEngineFragment`'s `onCreateView` method has been broken down into smaller, more manageable setup methods for improved readability.
- Updated persistence logic in `OnlineRoutingHelper` and UI display in `ProfileDataUtils` to reflect the new name handling.
- Simplified the `OnlineRoutingEngineDataObject` constructor.

Improvements:
- In `OnlineRoutingCard`, when an `EditText` gains focus, the soft keyboard is now automatically displayed, and the cursor is positioned at the end of the text.
- Renamed `bottom_sheet_item_with_descr_and_radio_and_eng_btn.xml` to `bottom_sheet_item_with_descr_radio_and_icon_btn.xml` for better semantic clarity.
