feat: Implement detailed voice guidance for turn types

Expanded voice navigation with specific commands for various turn types (e.g., sharp, slight, U-turn, go straight).
Refactored `CommandPlayer.CommandBuilder` to provide a more comprehensive API for voice commands.
Introduced `voice/_config.p` to define the logic for translating turn types into spoken prompts.
