refactor: Use LatLon object for location data

Refactors location handling to consistently use the `LatLon` object instead of separate `latitude` and `longitude` double fields. This improves type safety and reduces redundancy.
Updates UI components to accept `LatLon?` for target locations, allowing for cleaner null handling.
