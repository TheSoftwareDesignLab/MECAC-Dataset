refactor: Standardize drawable naming for map widgets and activities

Standardize drawable resource names by introducing `widget_` prefix for map control icons and `list_activities_` prefix for icons used in activity lists.
This includes renaming existing drawables (e.g., `compass.png` to `widget_compass.png`, `monitoring.png` to `list_activities_monitoring.png`) and updating their references in `MapInfoLayer` and `MonitoringInfoControl`.
