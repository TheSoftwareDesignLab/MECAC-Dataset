feat: Allow custom naming for key bindings

Users can now specify a custom name for key binding actions.
The `EditKeyBindingFragment` UI has been updated to include a dedicated field for custom names, which is edited via an AlertDialog. The toolbar title and action summary now display the custom name if available.
Refactored `KeyBinding` handling to pass `KeyBinding` objects directly, improving consistency and simplifying updates. `KeyBinding` objects are now serialized to JSON for fragment arguments and instance state, including the new `customName` field.
