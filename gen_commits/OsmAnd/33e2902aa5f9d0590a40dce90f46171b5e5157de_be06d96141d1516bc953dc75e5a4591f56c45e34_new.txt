feat(accessibility): Add customizable speech rate for TTS

Introduces a new setting to allow users to adjust the speech rate for Text-to-Speech (TTS) output, accessible via accessibility preferences.

Refactored `accessibilityEnabled()` and `accessibilityExtensions()` methods to be directly invoked on `OsmandApplication`, centralizing accessibility logic and simplifying API access.
