refactor(hu): Clarify offline data management terminology

Update Hungarian translations to use "activate/deactivate" instead of "backup/restore" for offline map data management. This provides a clearer understanding of how local map files are enabled or disabled within the application.
Also includes new strings for download space warnings and minor wording adjustments.
