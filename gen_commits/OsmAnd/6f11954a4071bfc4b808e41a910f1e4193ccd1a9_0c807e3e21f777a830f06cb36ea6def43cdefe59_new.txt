refactor: Optimize map layers and enhance marker lines drawing

- Refactored `MapMarkersLayer` to unify line and text drawing for software and OpenGL renderers.
- Introduced caching for downloaded and backup regions in `DownloadedRegionsLayer` to improve drawing performance.
- Added `NativeUtilities.getPointI31FromLatLon` for consistent 31-tile coordinate conversions.
- Improved arrow rendering for map markers, especially in OpenGL with a shifted map center.
