feat: Implement zoom to tap location on double-tap

Refactor `AnimateDraggingMapThread.startZooming` to accept an optional `LatLon` parameter, enabling zoom animations centered on a specific map coordinate. The map's double-tap gesture now utilizes this to zoom directly into the tapped location.

Existing `startZooming` calls were updated to pass `null` for the new `LatLon` parameter, preserving previous behavior where no specific zoom center is required. Also, `startMoving` was migrated to use `animateZoomToAndPan` for combined pan and zoom.
