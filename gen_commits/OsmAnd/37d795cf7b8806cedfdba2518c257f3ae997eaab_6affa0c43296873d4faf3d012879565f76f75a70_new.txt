refactor: Extract polygon and bounding box containment logic

Moved polygon and bounding box containment checks from WorldRegion to the
Algorithms utility class. This introduces:
- A new Point2D class for generic 2D point representation.
- Utility methods for converting LatLon to Point2D arrays,
  checking if one polygon is inside another, and determining if a point
  is within a polygon.
This improves code reusability and clarifies the implementation of region
containment logic in WorldRegion.
