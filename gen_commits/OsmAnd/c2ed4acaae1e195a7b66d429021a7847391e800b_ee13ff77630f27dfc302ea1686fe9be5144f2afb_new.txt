feat: Handle edited Telegram live location messages

Adds support for processing `TdApi.UpdateMessageEdited` events to track changes to live location messages.
- Updates the `editDate` for existing messages.
- Fetches and adds edited messages that were not previously tracked.
- Notifies listeners about updated messages.
Ensures UI updates triggered by `onReceiveChatLocationMessages` are executed on the main thread.
