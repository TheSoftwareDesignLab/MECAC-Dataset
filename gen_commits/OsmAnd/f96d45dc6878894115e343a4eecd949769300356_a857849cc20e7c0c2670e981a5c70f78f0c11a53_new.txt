feat: Enhance location icon rotation with snapped bearing

Introduces `lastBearing` in `RoutingHelper` and `RouteLayer` to track the bearing of the current projected route segment.
`PointLocationLayer` now uses this bearing to accurately rotate the user's location marker when following a route and snapping to road.
Refines bearing approximation in `RoutingHelperUtils`.
