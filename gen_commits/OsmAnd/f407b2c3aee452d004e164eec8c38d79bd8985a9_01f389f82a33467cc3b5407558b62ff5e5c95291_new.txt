feat: Improve storage migration feedback for existing files

Detect and report files that already exist at the destination during storage migration.
Existing files are now skipped (not overwritten) and their presence is communicated to the user.
Enhanced error reporting now includes the size of affected files.
The migration summary UI has been updated to display detailed information on failed and already existing files.
