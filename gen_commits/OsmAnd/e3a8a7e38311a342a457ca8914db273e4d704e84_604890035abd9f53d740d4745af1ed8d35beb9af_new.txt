feat: Enhance route legend icon visibility with contrast contour

Adds a circular contour to route legend icons in the Route Info card
when their color has insufficient contrast against the background,
improving readability and accessibility.

Includes:
- New drawable resources for dark and light circular contours.
- Improved sorting logic for route segment attributes in the legend.
- Refactored GPX chart border setting from BarDataSet to HorizontalBarChart.
