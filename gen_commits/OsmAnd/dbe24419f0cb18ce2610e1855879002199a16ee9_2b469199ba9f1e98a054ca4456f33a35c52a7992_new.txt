chore(nl): Add parking plugin strings and fix contour lines

Added numerous new translation strings for the parking position plugin, covering features like parking event notifications, time limits, plugin descriptions, and context menu actions.
Corrected the translation for `rendering_attr_contourLines_name` from 'Toon omtrek lijnen' to 'Toon hoogtelijnen' for improved accuracy.
