feat: Display alternative names in amenity context menu

Introduces support for displaying alternative names (e.g., 'alt_name:en')
for amenities in the map context menu.

- Added `ALT_NAME_WITH_LANG_PREFIX` and `getAltNamesMap()` to `Amenity`.
- Refactored `AmenityMenuBuilder` to display alternative names in a dedicated
  section, distinct from primary names.
- Added new string resource for "Alternative name".
- Ensures `alt_name:` prefixed keys are correctly processed and displayed.
