fix: Unblock gesture detector during double-tap detection

The previous condition prevented the gestureDetector from receiving events while the doubleTapScaleDetector was actively detecting a double-tap. This change ensures that the gestureDetector can continue to process events as long as the map is not in a zoom mode, improving responsiveness for other gestures that might coincide with or follow a double-tap attempt.
