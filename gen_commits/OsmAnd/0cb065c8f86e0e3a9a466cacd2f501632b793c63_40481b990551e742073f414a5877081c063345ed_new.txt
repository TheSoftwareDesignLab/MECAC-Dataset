refactor: Hide redundant type text in route configuration

The `R.id.descr` TextView in `CycleRoutesFragment` and `HikingRoutesFragment`
was displaying a route type string. This element was redundant with
other UI components like the main description and radio button labels.

This change removes the logic for setting its text and explicitly hides
the TextView, simplifying the UI and improving clarity.
