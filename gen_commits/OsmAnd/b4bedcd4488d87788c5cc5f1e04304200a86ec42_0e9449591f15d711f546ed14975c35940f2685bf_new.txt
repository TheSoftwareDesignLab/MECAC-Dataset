refactor: Consolidate dimension usage in XML layouts

Replaced hardcoded dimension values with `@dimen` resources for consistency and maintainability. Standardized dimension names across various bottom sheets, dialogs, and marker related layouts (e.g., `content_padding`, `text_margin_small`, `bottom_sheet_divider_margin`, `standard_icon_size`). Updated Java code to reference these new dimension resources.
