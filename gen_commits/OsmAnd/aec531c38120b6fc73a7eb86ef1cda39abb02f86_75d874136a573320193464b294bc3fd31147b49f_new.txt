refactor: Replace magic number -1 with INVALID_ID constant

Introduces `ContextMenuItem.INVALID_ID = 0` to explicitly represent an invalid
resource ID or value. This constant replaces the magic number -1 across
`ContextMenuAdapter` and `ContextMenuItem` where it was previously used to
signify an unset or invalid state for resource IDs (layout, icon, color,
progress) and builder default values.

This change enhances code readability, maintainability, and aligns with
standard Android practices where 0 often indicates no resource specified.

Additionally, the default color for items in the dark theme is updated from 0
(potentially transparent or black) to `R.color.color_white` for improved
visibility and consistency.
