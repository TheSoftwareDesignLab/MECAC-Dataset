fix(ui): Correct icon method usage and action mode display

Replaced `iconColor()` with `icon()` for setting menu item drawables in `LocalIndexesFragment` and `OsmEditingPlugin`.
Updated `OsMoGroupsActivity` to use `SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS` for action mode items, improving their visibility.
Added logic to correctly handle action mode menu initialization and restoration of the main menu in portrait orientation.
