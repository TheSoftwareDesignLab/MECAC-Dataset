feat: Improve double-tap zoom behavior for large screens

Refactor `DoubleTapScaleDetector` to directly depend on `OsmandMapTileView`,
reducing its dependency on `Activity`.
For extra-large devices, double-tap zoom now centers around the tap point;
on smaller screens, it remains centered on the map view.
Also, prevent long-press gestures from interfering with active double-tap scaling.
