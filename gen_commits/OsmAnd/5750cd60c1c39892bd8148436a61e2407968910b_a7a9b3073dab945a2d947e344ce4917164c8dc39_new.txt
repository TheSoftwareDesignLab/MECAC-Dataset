refactor: Centralize ApplicationMode state in RoutingHelper

The RoutingHelper now acts as the primary source of truth for the active ApplicationMode during routing and navigation.
Direct updates to the global settings.APPLICATION_MODE are replaced with updates to RoutingHelper's internal mode.
The global settings mode is initialized from settings and synchronized with RoutingHelper's mode when starting navigation.
This improves consistency and avoids discrepancies between the active routing mode and application settings.
