feat: Redesign favorite point editor UI

Introduces a new architecture for point editors by creating `PointEditorFragmentNew` as an abstract base fragment.
`FavoritePointEditorFragmentNew` is implemented using this new base, providing a redesigned interface and updated logic for adding and editing favorite points.
The `FavoritePointEditor` is updated to utilize this new fragment.
The associated layout `new_point_editor_fragment.xml` has been renamed to `point_editor_fragment_new.xml` to reflect its usage by the new fragment.
Minor styling adjustments were also applied to the existing `PointEditorFragment`.
