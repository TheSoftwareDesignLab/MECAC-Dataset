refactor: Centralize widget visibility for route info menu

Moves widget visibility management from `MapRouteInfoMenu` to `MapRouteInfoMenuFragment`.
Widgets are now hidden when the `MapRouteInfoMenuFragment` resumes and shown when it pauses, ensuring consistent behavior aligned with the fragment's lifecycle.
