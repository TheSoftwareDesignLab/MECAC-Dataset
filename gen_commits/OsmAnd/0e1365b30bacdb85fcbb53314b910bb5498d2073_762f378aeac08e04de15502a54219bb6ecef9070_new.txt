refactor: Migrate tile point calculations to double precision

Introduces `QuadPointDouble` to store coordinates with higher precision.
This change migrates `RotatedTileBox` and related map rendering
components from `float` to `double` for tile-based coordinate
calculations, improving accuracy and reducing potential
floating-point errors in map display and interactions.
