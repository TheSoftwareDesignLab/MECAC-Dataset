refactor(dashboard): Remove redundant animation coordinates assignment

The `animationCoordinates` assignment was duplicated within the `open` method.
Removed the redundant assignment outside the `if (animation)` block to ensure it's only set when animation is intended.
Updated the method comment to reflect the animation type.
