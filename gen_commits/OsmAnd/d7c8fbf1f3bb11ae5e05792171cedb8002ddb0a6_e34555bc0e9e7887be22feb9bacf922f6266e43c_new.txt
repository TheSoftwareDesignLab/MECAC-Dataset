style: Simplify text halo rendering in default.render.xml

Removed redundant textHaloRadius attributes from numerous text filters to streamline rendering.
Adjusted textHaloRadius for 'natural' peak filters from 1 to 0.5.
A small number of filters retain their textHaloRadius where still visually desired.
