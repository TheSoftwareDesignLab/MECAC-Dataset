refactor(tracks): Refine track segment UI and duration display

Adjusted layout and standardized text sizes in the track segment selection bottom sheet.
- Set padding for the GPX track 'read section'.
- Standardized font size for total distance, points count, and total time to 14sp.
- Prevented "1s" from being displayed for track segments with invalid or zero duration, showing an empty string instead.
- Removed unused GpxSelectionHelper imports and fields.
