refactor: Use minHeight for adaptable UI layout heights

Replaced fixed `android:layout_height` with `wrap_content` and introduced
`android:minHeight` in several layout files. This ensures UI elements
maintain a minimum visual size and touch target, while allowing their
height to expand dynamically based on content.

Also updated `fill_parent` to `match_parent` for improved consistency.

Affected layouts include:
- Plan Route Info
- Map Context Menu
- Map HUD Widget
- Quick Action buttons
