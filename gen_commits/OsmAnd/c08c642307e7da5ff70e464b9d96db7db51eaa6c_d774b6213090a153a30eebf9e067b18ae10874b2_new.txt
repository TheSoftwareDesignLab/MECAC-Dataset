refactor: Unify external sensor property and track data logic

Rename DeviceChangeableProperties to DeviceChangeableProperty and
WriteToGpxWidgetType to ExternalSensorTrackDataType for clarity.
Move property formatting, normalization, and unit retrieval logic
into the DeviceChangeableProperty enum. Centralize automatic setup
of track-writing preferences to ExternalSensorsPlugin.onDevicePaired.
Improve consistency by using ExternalSensorTrackDataType.preferenceId
for preferences.
