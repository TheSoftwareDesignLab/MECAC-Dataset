refactor: Improve Wikivoyage start editing card layout

Restructured the layout of the "Start Editing" card in Wikivoyage.
Changed the main container for the title and image from FrameLayout to LinearLayout, allowing for horizontal arrangement. The title TextView now uses layout_weight for flexible width, and the background ImageView's width is set to wrap_content.
Additionally, removed the selectableItemBackground from the 'Edit' button TextView.
