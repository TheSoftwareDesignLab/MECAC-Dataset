feat: Implement zooming tile for missing map data

If a tile at the current zoom level is not found, a tile from the previous
zoom level is now loaded from cache and scaled up to fill the missing area.
This improves map continuity when higher resolution tiles are unavailable.

- Modified ResourceManager to allow fetching tiles from cache without file system access.
- Updated OsmandMapTileView to implement the tile fallback logic.
- Cleaned up debug location override in MapActivity.
- Marked "Implement zooming tile" as DONE in ToDoConstants.
