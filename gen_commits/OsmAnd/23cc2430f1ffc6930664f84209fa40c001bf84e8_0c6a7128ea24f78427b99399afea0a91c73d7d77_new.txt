feat: Redesign voice guidance selection with bottom sheet

Refactor voice guidance settings to use a new bottom sheet fragment. This replaces the old ListPreference for voice provider selection with a more intuitive UI. Users can now easily switch between TTS and recorded voices, browse available languages, and manage voice package downloads directly from the settings.
