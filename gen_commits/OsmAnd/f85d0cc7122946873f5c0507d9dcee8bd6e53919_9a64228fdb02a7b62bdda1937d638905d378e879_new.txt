refactor: Improve POI additional info display using UI rules

Refactors the amenity information display in the map context menu into a
modular, rule-based system. This change introduces `PoiAdditionalUiRule`
and `IPoiAdditionalRowBehavior` components to manage specific display
logic and formatting for various POI tags.

This approach enhances maintainability, extensibility, and separation
of concerns for rendering different amenity attributes, including
localized and formatted values for metrics, opening hours, and links.

New amenity constants (URL, BRAND, OPERATOR, POPULATION, WIDTH, HEIGHT,
DISTANCE) were added, and a `USE_OLD_POI_TRANSLATION` preference was introduced.
