feat(dev): Keep zoom level text visible post-zoom

Introduces a `lastZoom` timestamp to track map zooming activity.
In development mode, the zoom level text will now remain visible
for 1 second after the map stops zooming, providing extended visual feedback.
The application mode icon will be shown instead when not in development mode, or
after the 1-second delay in development mode.
