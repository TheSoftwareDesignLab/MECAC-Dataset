feat: Allow selecting contour type for weather forecast

Introduce a new preference and UI to specify the contour type (e.g., temperature, wind) for weather forecasts independently.
This includes:
- Adding a new `weatherForecastContoursType` setting.
- Implementing selection UI in `WeatherForecastFragment` using a new popup menu.
- Creating `popup_menu_item_checkbox.xml` for displaying checkbox items in popups.
- Refactoring generic popup menu components to support custom item layouts (checkboxes vs. radio buttons).
- Adjusting map interaction (showing map position, disabling single-tap) when a custom forecast is active.
