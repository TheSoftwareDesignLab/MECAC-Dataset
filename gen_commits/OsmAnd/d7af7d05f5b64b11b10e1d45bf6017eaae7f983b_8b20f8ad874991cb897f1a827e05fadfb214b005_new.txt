refactor: Defer map rotation until other animations complete

Previously, map rotation logic was interleaved within the main animation loop, potentially
leading to uncoordinated animation states. This refactors the `AnimateDraggingMapThread`
to explicitly defer map rotation until after any dragging, panning, or zooming
animations have finished.

This change ensures a more coordinated and potentially smoother animation experience
by separating animation types.
- Moved rotation logic to a dedicated loop executed after position and zoom animations.
- Introduced `Thread.sleep(60)` within the rotation loop for smoother, paced rotation.
- Increased precision for the final rotation snap, changing the threshold from 2 degrees to 1 degree.
- Commented out `stopped = false` in `startRotate` as the thread's running state
  is now managed implicitly by the continuous animation loop.
