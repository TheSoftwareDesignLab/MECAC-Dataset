feat: Dynamically control terrain layer visibility by zoom

Introduce `TerrainTilesProvider` to manage terrain layer visibility based on SRTM plugin zoom settings.
The `shouldDisplayAtZoom` method in `MapTileLayer` (overridden in `TerrainLayer`) ensures terrain tiles are only displayed within the configured zoom range.
This change also refines the map reloading logic to clear cached tiles only when the visible zoom range changes and the current zoom falls outside the new range.
