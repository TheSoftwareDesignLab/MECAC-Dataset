refactor: Enhance map dragging animation with interpolator

Rewrites the `startDragging` method in `AnimateDraggingMapThread` to use a `DecelerateInterpolator` for a smoother, time-based map dragging experience.
The `onFling` method in `OsmandMapTileView` is updated to pass raw velocity values directly to the animation thread.
Removes verbose logging statements from `OsmandMapTileView#refreshMapInternal`.
