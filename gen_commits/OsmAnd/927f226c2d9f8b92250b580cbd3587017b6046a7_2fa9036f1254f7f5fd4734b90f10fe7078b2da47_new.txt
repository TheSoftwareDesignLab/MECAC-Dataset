feat: Redesign main menu and add background task dispatcher

Redesigned the main menu layout, including a new background color, fixed button
widths, and a graphical "Exit" button.
Added a new "Search" button to the menu.

Implemented a generic framework (`LongRunningActionDispatcher` and
`LongRunningActionCallback`) to execute long-running tasks in the background
with a progress dialog. Migrated POI indexing to use this new dispatcher,
improving UI responsiveness.
