feat: Enhance Quick Actions widget with theme support

Refactors the Quick Actions widget to properly support light and dark themes.
Changes include using theme attributes for colors and backgrounds in XML,
dynamically inflating layouts with `ContextThemeWrapper`, and applying
theme-dependent colors for icons and controls in Java.
