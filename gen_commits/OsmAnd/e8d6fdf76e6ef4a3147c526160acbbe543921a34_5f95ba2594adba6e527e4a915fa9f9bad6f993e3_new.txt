feat: Enhance Gpx folder management and list state persistence

Introduces the ability to create nested Gpx track folders, allowing users to organize tracks more flexibly. Improves state restoration for track lists, ensuring the previously viewed folder and selected track item are correctly displayed upon returning.

Adds a long-click action to track items in search results, enabling direct access to the folder's track selection screen. Refactors Gpx file renaming to use a centralized utility method and updates UI elements to use standard Android widgets and modern layout attributes.
