refactor(osmo): Improve group item interaction and list performance

Redesigned OsMo group list items with dedicated settings button and enable/disable toggle.
Refactored group interaction logic, moving group selection and connection/disconnection from the group click listener to new UI elements.
Optimized list refreshing by adding thresholds for location (8m) and compass (15 deg) updates to reduce unnecessary UI updates.
Adjusted layout margins for better visual spacing of check items.
Refined device item display logic based on enabled state and location.
