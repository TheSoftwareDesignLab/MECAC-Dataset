refactor: Streamline complex routing preference inversion

Consolidate the logic for inverting the DISABLE_COMPLEX_ROUTING preference. The explicit inversion is now handled within OsmAndPreferencesDataStore for read/write operations and in the RouteParametersFragment's onPreferenceChange listener. This removes the need for scattered UI-side inversions, improving consistency and maintainability.
