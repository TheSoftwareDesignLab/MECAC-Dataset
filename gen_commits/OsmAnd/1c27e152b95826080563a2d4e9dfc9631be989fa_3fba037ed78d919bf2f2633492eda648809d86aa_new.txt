feat: Restore map view state on Route Preview screen exit

Preserves and restores map settings (compass mode, elevation, rotation, map linking) when entering and exiting the Route Preview Screen. Previously, settings were reset in `onDestroy`, which led to inconsistent map state upon screen resume. This ensures a consistent map view for the user.
Additionally, the map now zooms to the route on `onResume` and the route update logic in `onCreate` is more precise.
