feat: Enhance rendered object type, name, and icon display

Refactor RenderedObjectMenuController to use a more robust tag-based translation for polygon types and icons. This improves accuracy by replacing explicit PoiCategory and AbstractPoiType fields with a new method that iterates through object tags.
Additionally, removed the fallback to display OSM URLs as object names in MapRendererContext.
