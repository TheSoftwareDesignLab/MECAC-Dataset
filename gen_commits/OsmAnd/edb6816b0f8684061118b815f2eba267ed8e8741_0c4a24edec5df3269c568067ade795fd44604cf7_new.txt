feat(i18n): Add Chinese (Simplified) strings for Telegram Tracker

This commit introduces a large set of new string resources for the Chinese (Simplified) locale. It covers various aspects of the OsmAnd Telegram Tracker, including user onboarding, login/logout flows, account management, location sharing settings, and integration with OsmAnd. The new strings enable a fully localized experience for these features and include a minor punctuation fix.
