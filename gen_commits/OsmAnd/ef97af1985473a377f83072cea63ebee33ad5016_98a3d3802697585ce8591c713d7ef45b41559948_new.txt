refactor: Refine routing turn penalty and test road ID comparison

Improve turn penalty calculation to apply half the absolute difference in transition speeds, making it symmetrical.
Adjust BinaryRoutePlanner's test road ID comparison to use a right shift (>> 6) to align with updated ID structure or testing methodology.
Remove unused import `ArrayList`.
