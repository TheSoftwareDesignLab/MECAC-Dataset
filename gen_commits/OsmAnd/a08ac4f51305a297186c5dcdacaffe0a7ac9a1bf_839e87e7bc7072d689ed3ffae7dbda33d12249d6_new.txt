refactor: Improve backup screen icon animation and fragment cleanup

- Rewrote `BackupIconsView` to use pre-populated icon lists and a continuous horizontal scroll with wrap-around, replacing the dynamic column generation.
- Simplified `createToolbar` in `BackupAuthorizationFragment` by removing redundant `ViewCompat` usage and streamlining AppBarLayout setup.
