refactor: Unify favorite selection UI with bottom sheets

Replaces old dialogs and fragments for selecting favorite points with a new, unified bottom sheet architecture.
Introduces `SelectFavouriteBottomSheet` as an abstract base for common favorite selection logic.
Implements `SelectFavouriteToReplaceBottomSheet` and `SelectFavouriteToGoBottomSheet` for specific use cases, such as replacing existing favorites or setting route points.
Removes `FavoriteDialogs.createReplaceFavouriteDialog` and `FavouritesBottomSheetMenuFragment`.
