refactor: Unify and improve app theming and styles

Introduces a more robust and consistent theming approach across the application.
Key changes include:
- Replaced direct `android:textColor` with granular `textColorPrimary`,
  `textColorSecondary`, and `textColorTertiary` in `OsmandTheme`.
- Added `android:colorBackground` and `android:colorBackgroundCacheHint` to main theme.
- Introduced `CustomTitleTheme.Preference` for specific styling of preference screens
  with a dark background, addressing potential inconsistencies.
- Removed deprecated/redundant custom styles like `OsmandAutoCompleteTextView`
  and `OsmandSpinnerItem`.
- Made `CustomTitleBar` flexible to accept different themes.
- Applied `CustomTitleTheme.Preference` to `SettingsActivity`.
