refactor: Centralize context menu fragment logic and UI

Introduced `ContextMenuFragment` as a base class for shared logic, including state management, animations, and touch handling.
`MapRouteInfoMenuFragment` and `RouteDetailsFragment` now extend this base, reducing duplication.
Created a reusable `context_menu_top_shadow.xml` layout and `activity_background_basic` theme attribute for consistent UI.
Adjusted various layout attributes, padding, and background settings across route info screens.
Refined visibility of map controls (zoom buttons, back-to-location) based on menu state and orientation.
