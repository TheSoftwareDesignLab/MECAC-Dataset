feat: Implement Ant nightbuild process with FTP deployment

Adds a comprehensive Ant build system including:
- A new `nightbuild` target to clean, update from SVN, compile, and build the project.
- Automatic FTP deployment of the generated artifact to download.osmand.net.
- Integration of SvnAnt libraries for SVN interaction within the build.
- Introduction of `local.properties.sample` for configuring FTP credentials.

Refactors `OsmStorageWriter` to utilize standard `XMLOutputFactory` for XML stream writing, replacing internal Sun APIs for improved portability.
