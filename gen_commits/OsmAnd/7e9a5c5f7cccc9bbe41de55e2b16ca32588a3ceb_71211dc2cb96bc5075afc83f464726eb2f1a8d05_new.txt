refactor: Centralize map location selection flow

The map location selection logic has been refactored to improve modularity and
separate concerns.

- Introduced `onApplySelection` and `onScreenClosed` to `ILocationSelectionHandler`
  to manage the lifecycle of a location selection process.
- `SelectLocationController` now orchestrates the selection by calling these
  handler methods.
- `MapRouteInfoMenu` and `SelectMapLocationAction` are updated to use the new
  handler-based approach, moving the coordinate retrieval and action execution
  into the handler's `onApplySelection` method.
- This change moves direct map interaction details out of UI layers and into
  the dedicated selection controller and handler, simplifying event handling.
