fix(routing): Correctly iterate intermediate segment endpoints

The `segmentEndpoints` list is expected to contain pairs of points representing the start and end of intermediate route segments. The previous iteration logic (`i++`) incorrectly processed adjacent points (e.g., `(end1, start2)`).

This change updates the loop increment to `i += 2` in `insertIntermediateSegments` and `findRouteWithIntermediateSegments` to correctly process `(start, end)` pairs. This ensures proper calculation and insertion of intermediate route parts.

Additionally, checks for empty route segments were added to `findRouteWithIntermediateSegments` to improve robustness.
