feat: Add Mapillary cache and tile reload functionality

Implement a "Reload tiles" button in the Mapillary filter fragment.
This button clears both raster and vector Mapillary tiles from disk and cache,
allowing users to refresh displayed Mapillary images.
Update the filter description to clarify that filters apply only at close zoom levels.
