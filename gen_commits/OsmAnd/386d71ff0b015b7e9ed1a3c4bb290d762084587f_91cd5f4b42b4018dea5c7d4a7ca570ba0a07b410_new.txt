feat: Enhance card theming and WebView font scaling

Dynamically set background colors for GPX description and Wikivoyage article cards based on the app's light/dark theme. This refactors styling from XML to Java for better control.
Also, configure the WebView to respect the system's font scale for improved accessibility in GPX description dialogs.
