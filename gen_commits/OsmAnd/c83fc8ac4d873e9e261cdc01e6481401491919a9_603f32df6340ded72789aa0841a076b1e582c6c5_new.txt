feat: Introduce explicit 'follow track' mode for GPX routes

This flag is passed when a GPX track is selected to be followed, differentiating it from general GPX route loading. When enabled, it prevents the recalculation of OsmAnd route parts using intermediate points, allowing for more direct adherence to the GPX track.
