fix(map): Refine map language dialog interaction

- Changed map language selection to use "Apply" and "Cancel" buttons.
- Implemented logic to prevent conflicting transliteration and specific language settings:
    - Transliteration is automatically deselected and local names chosen if a specific language is picked.
- Updated string resource key for "Download maps" menu item.
