refactor: Extract trip recording widget to dedicated class

Move the complex logic for the trip recording distance widget from OsmandMonitoringPlugin
into a new class, TripRecordingDistanceWidget. This improves separation of concerns
and simplifies the plugin's code.

Also renames `controlDialog` to `showTripRecordingDialog` for clarity.
