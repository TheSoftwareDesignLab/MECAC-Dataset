refactor: Centralize widget type allowance in WidgetType enum

Moves the logic for checking if a widget type is allowed (e.g., Altitude Map
Center based on 3D maps plugin) from various locations into the WidgetType
enum's `isAllowed()` method.

This ensures consistent filtering and visibility handling of widgets
based on their type availability across the application:
- MapWidgetRegistry filters out disallowed types.
- Widget groups correctly reflect availability.
- Simple widgets hide themselves if their type is not allowed.
