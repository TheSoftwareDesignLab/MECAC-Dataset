fix: Correct derived routing profile selection logic

Refines the logic for selecting routing profiles in the bottom sheet.
Ensures that when the current app mode is a derived profile, only the corresponding derived routing profile is selected.
When the current app mode is "default" (not derived), only base routing profiles (those not derived themselves) are considered selected.
This prevents incorrect highlighting of routing profiles in the UI.
