feat: Implement off-route voice guidance announcement

Introduces a new voice prompt when the user deviates more than 350m from the planned route, active when a GPX track is followed. The announcement is managed by a cooldown mechanism, starting at 30 seconds and progressively increasing with subsequent alerts.

Also updates bundled assets for Polish (pl-tts) voices, replacing 'pl-tts-old' with 'pl' and removing a redundant asset definition.
