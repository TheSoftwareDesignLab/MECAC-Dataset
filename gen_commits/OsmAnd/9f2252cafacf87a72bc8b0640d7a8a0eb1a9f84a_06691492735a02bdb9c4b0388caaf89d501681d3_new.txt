refactor: Remove MapRendererView param from animatingMapAnimator

The `animatingMapAnimator` method no longer accepts a `MapRendererView` parameter.
Instead, it now obtains the renderer internally via `getMapRenderer()` and includes null checks for safety. This improves robustness and reduces coupling.
