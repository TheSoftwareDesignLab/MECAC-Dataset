feat: Add callback for map marker saves in coordinate input

Introduce `OnMapMarkersSavedListener` in `CoordinateInputDialogFragment` to notify the parent `MapMarkersDialogFragment` when new markers are saved.

This enables `MapMarkersDialogFragment` to automatically refresh its marker lists (active, groups, history) after markers are added via the coordinate input dialog. The static `showInstance()` method in `CoordinateInputDialogFragment` has been removed in favor of direct instantiation and listener assignment.
