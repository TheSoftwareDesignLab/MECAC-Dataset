refactor: Centralize widget deletion confirmation

Extract widget deletion confirmation logic into a dedicated controller and dialog.
This improves code organization, reusability, and allows for better state
management and callbacks after a widget is deleted. A new 'usedOnMap'
parameter is introduced to provide context to the dialog.
