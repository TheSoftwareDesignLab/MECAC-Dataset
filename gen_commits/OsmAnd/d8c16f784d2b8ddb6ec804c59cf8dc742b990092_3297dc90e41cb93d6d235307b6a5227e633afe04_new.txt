feat: Redesign Coordinate Input dialog with inline fields

The coordinate input dialog's layout has been significantly revamped. Latitude,
longitude, and name input fields are now displayed directly within the App Bar
for easier access.

Layout structure changed from nested FrameLayouts to a vertical LinearLayout.
Implemented focus handling for the new input fields.
Removed the bottom shadow and temporarily hid the numeric keyboard GridView.
