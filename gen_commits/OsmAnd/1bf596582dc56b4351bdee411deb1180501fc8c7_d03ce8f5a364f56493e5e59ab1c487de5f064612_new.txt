feat: Auto-start navigation if route is active on session resume

Automatically starts navigation when the car navigation session resumes if a route is calculated and following mode is enabled.
Refactors `startNavigation` to prevent re-pushing the navigation screen if already active and consolidates navigation screen initialization.
Updates `showRoutePreview` to use `isFollowingMode` from `RoutingHelper`.
Removes redundant screen push logic from `LandingScreen.kt`.
