docs: Update German localization for release notes and UI

Expanded the `tip_recent_changes_0_8_1_t` string to include comprehensive release notes for version 0.8.1, detailing navigation enhancements, lane display, speed limits, voice guidance, parking plugin, and track recording display.
Also, refined text for `select_animate_speedup` and `use_compass_navigation_descr` for improved clarity.
