feat: Improve map zoom scale and Android 10+ storage handling

- Added a 500% option to the map zoom scale selector.
- Removed the upper limit on density-based zoom scale calculation, allowing higher scaling on very high-density displays.
- Adjusted external storage directory logic to handle Android 10+ (API 29+) scoped storage, ensuring the app correctly finds its data within `/Android/data/<package_name>`.
