fix: Clear map center when context menu is closed

Replaced direct 'hide()' calls with 'updateMapCenter(null)' followed by 'close()'.
This ensures that the map center associated with the context menu is explicitly
reset when the menu is dismissed by map taps or touch events, preventing stale
state issues.
