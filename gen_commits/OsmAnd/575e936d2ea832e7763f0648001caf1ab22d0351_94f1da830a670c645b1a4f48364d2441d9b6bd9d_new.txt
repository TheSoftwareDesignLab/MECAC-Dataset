refactor: Centralize AIDL callback management

Moved the management of AIDL callbacks, particularly for navigation updates,
from OsmandAidlApi to OsmandAidlService. This change centralizes callback
handling and uses a key (KEY_ON_NAV_DATA_UPDATE) to differentiate and
properly route navigation update notifications.
