refactor: Remove redundant update flags for location/heading

Removed `locationNeedUpdate` and `headingNeedUpdate` boolean flags.
Location and compass updates are now immediately pushed to `updateMarkerData` on the UI thread when received.
This streamlines the update mechanism, bypassing flag-based buffering and improving responsiveness for marker rendering.
