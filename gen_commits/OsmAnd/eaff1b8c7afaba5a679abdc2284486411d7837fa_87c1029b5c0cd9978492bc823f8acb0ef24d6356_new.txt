refactor: Simplify altitude and speed display in measurement tool

Removes dedicated string resources for measurement tool altitude and speed.
Now reuses existing generic strings for altitude and map widget speed,
extracting their first letter (e.g., 'A:' for altitude, 'S:' for speed)
to display a more compact label.
