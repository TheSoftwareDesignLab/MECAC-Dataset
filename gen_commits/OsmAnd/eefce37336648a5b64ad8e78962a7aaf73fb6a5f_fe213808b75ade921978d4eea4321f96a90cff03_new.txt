refactor(widgets): Decouple WidgetGroup and WidgetParams association

Improved the association by adding a direct 'group' field to WidgetParams.
This removes the redundant and inefficient `getGroup()` method in WidgetParams and the hardcoded lists in WidgetGroup.getWidgets().
Now, WidgetGroup.getWidgets() iterates through all WidgetParams and filters by the explicit group field.
All references to `getGroup()` were updated to access the new 'group' field directly.
