refactor: Control map fitting when updating GPX track details

Introduces a `forceFitTrackOnMap` parameter to manage whether the map
should automatically zoom to the track when its details or chart are
refreshed.

Updates on view creation or layout changes no longer force the map
to fit the track by default, preventing unexpected map jumps.

Also removes `OPEN_TRACKS_LIST` extra when opening `TrackActivity`
from the GPX context menu, ensuring direct focus on the selected track.
