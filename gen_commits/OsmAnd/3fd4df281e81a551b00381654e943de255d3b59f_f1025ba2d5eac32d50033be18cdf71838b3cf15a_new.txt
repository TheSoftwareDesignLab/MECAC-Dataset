fix(widget): Improve visual zoom level offset calculation

Refined the calculation of the offset from logical zoom for better accuracy.
- Renamed `getZoomFromMapDensity` to `getZoomDeltaFromMapScale` and updated its logic to correctly handle map scales less than 1.0.
- Introduced a `visualZoom` factor to derive a more precise map scale for the offset calculation.
