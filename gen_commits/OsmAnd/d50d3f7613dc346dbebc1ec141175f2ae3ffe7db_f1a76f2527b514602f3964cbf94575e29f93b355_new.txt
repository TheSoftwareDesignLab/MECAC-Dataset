refactor: Split widget visibility logic into granular methods

The `updateControlsVisibility` method has been refactored to separate the concerns of updating top/side widgets and bottom controls.

- Introduced `updateWidgetsVisibility(boolean)` for top/side widgets.
- Introduced `updateBottomControlsVisibility(boolean)` for bottom controls.
- `updateControlsVisibility` now delegates to these new methods.
- `hideWidgets` and `showWidgets` methods now directly call `updateWidgetsVisibility`.

This improves code clarity and modularity for widget visibility management.
