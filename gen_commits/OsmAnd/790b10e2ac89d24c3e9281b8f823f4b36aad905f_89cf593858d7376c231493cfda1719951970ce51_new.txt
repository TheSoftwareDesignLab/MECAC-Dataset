feat(ui): Centralize compound button and seek bar styling

- Introduced `UiUtilities` for consistent application of profile-dependent colors and day/night mode to `CompoundButton` and `SeekBar` widgets.
- Replaced standard Android dialog choice items with `DialogListItemAdapter` and a custom layout for improved theming.
- Applied new styling across Configure Map, Settings, Raster Map, GPX, Mapillary, Map Markers, and other dialogs/menus.
- Fixed `profile_icon_color_dark` values by removing incorrect alpha prefixes.
