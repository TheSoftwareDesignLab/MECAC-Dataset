feat: Introduce profile-specific accessibility settings screen

Adds a dedicated accessibility settings screen under plugin settings,
allowing users to configure options per application profile.

Key changes include:
- New `accessibility_settings.xml` and `AccessibilitySettingsFragment.java`
  for comprehensive accessibility controls.
- Migrates existing and new accessibility preferences to be profile-specific,
  allowing distinct settings for different application modes.
- Introduces new options for speech rate, auto-announcement, route
  recalculation behavior, direction style, and feedback.
- Removes `android:fadingEdge="horizontal"` from various preference layouts
  and allows text wrapping for some descriptions.
- Updates `summaryOff`/`summaryOn` strings for offline OSM editing to use
  "disabled"/"enabled" for consistency.
- Ensures OSM login data summary updates immediately after editing.
