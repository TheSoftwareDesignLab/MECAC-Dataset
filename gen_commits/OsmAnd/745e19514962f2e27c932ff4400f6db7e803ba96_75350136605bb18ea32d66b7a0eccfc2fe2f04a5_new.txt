feat: Introduce basic text styles for UI components

Adds a set of foundational text styles (Title, Description, Small Description)
and their medium-weight variants. This aims to standardize text appearance
across the application for improved consistency and maintainability.
Also includes the `small_desc_line_height` dimension.
