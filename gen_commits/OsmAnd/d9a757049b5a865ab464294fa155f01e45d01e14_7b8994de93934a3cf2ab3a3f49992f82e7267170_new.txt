feat: Add preselected route activity to track monitoring

Introduces a preference in Monitoring settings to select a default
route activity for tracks. This allows users to choose an activity
that will be preselected when recording tracks. The selected activity
is displayed in the settings and can be changed via a dialog.

Additionally, streamlines the visibility configuration for external
sensor-related preferences, making them visible by default in the XML.
