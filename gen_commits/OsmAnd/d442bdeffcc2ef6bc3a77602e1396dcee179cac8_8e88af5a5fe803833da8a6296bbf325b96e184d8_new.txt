fix: Condition voice command playback on audio focus

Ensures that all voice command playback (TTS, Media, JSMedia)
is contingent on the application currently holding audio focus.

Changes include:
- `AudioFocusHelperImpl.onAudioFocusChange()` now explicitly sets
  `playbackAuthorized` to `true` on any GAIN and `false` on any LOSS,
  including TRANSIENT and CAN_DUCK scenarios.
- `JSMediaCommandPlayerImpl`, `MediaCommandPlayerImpl`, and
  `TTSCommandPlayerImpl` now check `playbackAuthorized` before
  initiating speech.
- Removed unused `playbackDelayed` flag.
This prevents audio from playing when focus is not granted.
