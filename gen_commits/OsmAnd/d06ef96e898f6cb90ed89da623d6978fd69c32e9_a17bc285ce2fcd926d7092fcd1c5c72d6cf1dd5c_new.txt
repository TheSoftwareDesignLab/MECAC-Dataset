fix: TargetPointsHelper uses correct intermediate points list

Corrects an issue in TargetPointsHelper where methods were iterating
over or adding to local `intermediatePoints` lists instead of the
class's member `this.intermediatePoints`. This ensures that actual
intermediate points are retrieved and processed correctly.

Also includes minor logging improvements:
- Adds context to `System.err` messages in AppInitializer for missing
  translations and in SearchHistoryHelper for reinserting values.
- Removes an unnecessary debug print in AudioVideoNotesPlugin.
