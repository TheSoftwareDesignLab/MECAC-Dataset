feat: Auto-manage Boat profile on Nautical plugin enable/disable

The Nautical Maps plugin now automatically adds the 'Boat' application mode
to the available profiles when the plugin is enabled. Conversely, it removes
the 'Boat' profile when the plugin is disabled. This ensures the 'Boat' profile
is only available when the Nautical Maps plugin is active.
