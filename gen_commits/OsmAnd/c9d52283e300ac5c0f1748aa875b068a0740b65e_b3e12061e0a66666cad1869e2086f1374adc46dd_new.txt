fix: Restrict custom map gestures to Android 4.0 and below

The 'Scroll map by gestures' preference and its custom map interaction logic are now only active on Android versions older than Ice Cream Sandwich (API 14).
On Android 4.0 (ICS) and newer, native map gesture handling is always used, providing a more consistent and compatible experience.
