refactor: Consolidate InputDeviceHelper sync and notifications

The `syncSettings` method in `InputDeviceHelper` now accepts an `EventType` parameter and handles both saving settings and notifying listeners. This centralizes the event notification logic.
`EditKeyBindingFragment` was updated to listen to `InputDeviceHelper` events for UI refreshes, removing redundant view update calls.
