refactor: Remove detailed forecast info display from WeatherWidget

Removed the development-specific `showForecastInfoToast` functionality, which provided detailed forecast download and tile status information.
Cleaned up associated fields (`lastObtainingFailed`, `lastSuccessfulObtainedRequestTime`), helper methods (`getForecastDbLastDownload`, `getTilesStatus`), and unused imports.
Removed `TIFF_DB_EXT` constant as it's no longer referenced.
Simplified the `IObtainValueAsyncCallback` interface by removing the `requestedTime` parameter.
