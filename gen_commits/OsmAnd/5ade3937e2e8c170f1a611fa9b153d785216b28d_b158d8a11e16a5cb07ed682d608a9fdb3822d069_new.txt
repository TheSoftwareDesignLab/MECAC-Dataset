refactor: Improve POIMapLayer code structure and route following check

- Made `routingHelper`, `data`, and `app` fields final.
- Reordered import statements.
- Replaced `wph.isRouteCalculated()` with `routingHelper.isFollowingMode()` for more accurate route following detection.
- Optimized `LatLon` object usage to reduce redundant calls.
