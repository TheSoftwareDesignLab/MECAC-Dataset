fix: Recreate NextTurnBaseWidget's turn indicator drawable

The `turnDrawable` field was previously `final`, preventing its re-initialization
during `recreateView()`. This could lead to incorrect rendering or display
issues if the view context changed (e.g., configuration change).

The `turnDrawable` is now re-initialized within `recreateView()`, ensuring it
adapts to the new view context while preserving its critical state (turn type,
imminent status, and deviation from route).
