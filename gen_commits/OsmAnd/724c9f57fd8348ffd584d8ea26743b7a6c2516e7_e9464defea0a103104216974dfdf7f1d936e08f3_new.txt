fix: Update audio stream preference behavior and UI

The ListPreferenceEx for audio stream guidance now updates its value directly in onPreferenceChange to ensure the UI immediately reflects the user's selection. Previously, the UI might not have updated until after confirmation.
Additionally, added logic in onApplyPreferenceChange to correctly apply the audio stream preference across all application profiles when the 'Apply to all profiles' option is selected, ensuring the setting is propagated to all modes.
