feat: Sync OsMo sign-in WebView font with system settings

The WebView used for the OsMo sign-in process now scales its font size
according to the device's system font size settings. This improves
accessibility and user experience.

- For API 14+, `setTextZoom` is used for smooth scaling.
- For older API levels, `setTextSize` is applied with predefined font sizes
  based on discrete `fontScale` ranges.
