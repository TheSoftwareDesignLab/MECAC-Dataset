refactor(ui): Make snap to road dialog content scrollable

Wrap the content of the "Snap to road" bottom sheet dialog within a ScrollView.
This ensures that the dialog content, including the title, description, and
navigation types, remains fully visible and accessible on devices with smaller
screens or when the list of navigation types is extensive.
Adjusted padding for visual consistency.
