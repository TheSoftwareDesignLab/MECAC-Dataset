fix: Align HM renderer names & improve text spacing

Aligns the renderer names for 'hm' and 'hm-night' themes (from 'all-purpose' and 'all-purpose-night') with their respective file names. This resolves an issue with automatic day/night switching.
Added `depends="hm"` to `hm-night.render.xml`.

Increased the vertical text height for non-horizontal way labels by `5 * dm.density` in `OsmandRenderer.java` to improve readability and prevent text overlap.
