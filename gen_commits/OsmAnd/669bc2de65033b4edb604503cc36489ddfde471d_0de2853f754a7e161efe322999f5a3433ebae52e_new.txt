refactor(keyevents): Redesign EditKeyAssignment fragment

Rewrote EditKeyAssignmentFragment to use a RecyclerView with a dedicated adapter and controller.
- Separated UI logic into EditKeyAssignmentAdapter and business logic into EditKeyAssignmentController.
- Renamed `fragment_edit_key_action.xml` to `fragment_edit_key_assignment.xml`.
- Added an "Add new button" action to the menu, allowing users to assign multiple key codes to an action.
- Improved validation for key assignment, including checks for existing key codes and already cleared assignments.
- Added helper methods `hasKeyCode` and `hasKeyCodes` to KeyAssignment.
