fix: Adjust two-finger tap detection timeout

The TIMEOUT constant for SimpleTwoFingerTapDetector was incorrectly using
ViewConfiguration.getDoubleTapTimeout(). This timeout is meant for
detecting two consecutive taps. For a single, simultaneous two-finger
tap gesture, ViewConfiguration.getTapTimeout() is more appropriate,
ensuring a more precise and responsive detection.
