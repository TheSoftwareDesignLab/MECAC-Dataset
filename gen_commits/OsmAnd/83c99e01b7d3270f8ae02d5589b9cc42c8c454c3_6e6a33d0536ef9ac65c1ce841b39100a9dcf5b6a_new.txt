feat: Centralize toolbar overflow icon setup and enhance UI themes

Introduces `UiUtilities.setupToolbarOverflowIcon` for consistent setting and tinting of toolbar overflow icons.
- `WikivoyageArticleDialogFragment` now utilizes this new utility.
- `OsmLiveActivity` dynamically sets tab text colors based on the current theme (day/night mode).
- `LocalIndexesFragment` uses `getThemedIcon` for its submenu overflow icon, improving consistency.
