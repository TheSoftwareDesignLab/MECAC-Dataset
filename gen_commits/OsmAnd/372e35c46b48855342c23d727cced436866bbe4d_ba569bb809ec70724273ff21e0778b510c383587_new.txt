fix: Improve bottom sheet keyboard interaction

Refactor bottom sheet layout to be more adaptive, especially
when the software keyboard is active.

- Make bottom sheet content area flexible using `layout_weight`.
- Add focusability to root layout for better keyboard dismissal.
- Remove manual scroll view height adjustments and delayed
  scrolling logic in `SendGpxBottomSheetFragment`, simplifying
  keyboard handling and preventing layout issues. Instead, the
  background is adapted based on available space.
