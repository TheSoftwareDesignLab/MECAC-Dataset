refactor: Consolidate RecyclerView reorder immobility logic

Introduces a generic ImmobileViewHolder within ReorderItemTouchHelperCallback to prevent specific items from being reordered.

This change allows for the removal of QuickActionItemTouchHelperCallback, as its specialized header immobility logic is now handled by extending the new ImmobileViewHolder.

Includes a new string resource for profile deletion description and a minor variable rename in RouteParametersFragment.
