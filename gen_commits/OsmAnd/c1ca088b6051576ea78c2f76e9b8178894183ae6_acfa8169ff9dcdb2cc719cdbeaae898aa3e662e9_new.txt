feat: Introduce local item size calculation listener

Introduce `LocalSizeCalculationListener` to observe local item size calculation events.
The `LocalSizeController` now notifies registered listeners when item sizes are calculated or updated.
This allows `LocalCategoriesFragment`, `LocalItemsFragment`, and `LocalSearchFragment` to dynamically refresh their UI, ensuring up-to-date size information is displayed.
Includes related adapter and data model refactorings for dynamic UI updates.
