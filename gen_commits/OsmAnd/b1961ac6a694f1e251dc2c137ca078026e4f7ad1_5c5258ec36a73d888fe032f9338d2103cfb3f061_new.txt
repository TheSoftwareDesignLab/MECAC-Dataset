refactor: Decouple layers and add `unknownLocation` to object collection

Removed `MapActivity` dependency from `GPXLayer` and `FavouritesLayer` constructors, making them more independent.
Added `unknownLocation` parameter to `IContextMenuProvider.collectObjectsFromPoint` and its implementations to provide more context during object selection.
