feat: Measurement tool: Add GPX approximation & route options

Introduces new functionality for GPX track approximation (snap to road) within the measurement tool.
- Implements `GpxApproximationFragment` to manage UI for selecting navigation profiles and a threshold distance for approximation.
- Enhances the "Route between points" dialog (`RouteBetweenPointsBottomSheetDialogFragment`) to allow calculation for either the "next segment" or the "whole track".
- Adds `SnapTrackWarningBottomSheet` to provide context and prompt users before performing a snap-to-road operation.
- Updates the options menu (`OptionsBottomSheetDialogFragment`) to integrate these new features and includes new actions like "Reverse route".
- Adds new layout components (`navigation_profiles_card.xml`, `plan_route_threshold_slider.xml`) and string resources.
