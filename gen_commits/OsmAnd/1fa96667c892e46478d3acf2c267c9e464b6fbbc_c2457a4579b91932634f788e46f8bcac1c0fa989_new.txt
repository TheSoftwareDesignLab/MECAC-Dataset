style: Refine minzoom levels for map features

Adjusted minzoom levels for various map elements in render.xml.
Most features, such as streams, aeroway runways, and certain POIs
(marinas, windmills, bus stations, places of worship, outdoor shops),
will now render at lower zoom levels. A few elements (e.g., cave entrances,
aerodromes, motorcycle shops) will appear at slightly higher zoom levels.
