feat: Select profile for online route approximation

Allows users to specify an application mode (routing profile) to be used when approximating an online GPX track to the road network. Previously, route approximation was a simple boolean toggle.

This provides more control over how GPX tracks are attached to roads, enabling different vehicle types to influence the approximation logic. A new UI for selecting the profile has been added to the online routing engine settings.
