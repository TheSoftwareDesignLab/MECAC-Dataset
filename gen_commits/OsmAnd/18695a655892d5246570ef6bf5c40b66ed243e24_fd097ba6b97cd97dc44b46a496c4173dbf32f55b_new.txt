localize(sk): Update offline data manager description

Improved the Slovak translation for the offline data manager description.
Simplified phrasing by removing "Môžete" (You can) and the parenthetical explanation of 'park'.
Replaced "telefóne" (phone) with "zariadení" (device) for broader applicability.
