fix: Refine auto-track recording conditions

Changed 'OR' to 'AND' in the 'isRecordingAutomatically()' method's condition.
This makes automatic track recording more precise, now requiring both an active
following mode (isFollowingMode()) and for the application to be in the same
non-default routing mode as the last session. Previously, recording could occur
if isFollowingMode() was true, even if the lastRoutingApplicationMode condition
was not met, potentially leading to unintended recordings.
