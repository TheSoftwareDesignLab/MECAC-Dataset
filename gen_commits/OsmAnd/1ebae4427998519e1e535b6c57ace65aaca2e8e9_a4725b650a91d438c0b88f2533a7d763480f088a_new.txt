refactor: Centralize widget visibility and clean up unused UI

Remove the map_route_land_left_margin view and its associated dimensions.
Delegate map widget visibility control from MapRouteInfoMenu to
WidgetsVisibilityHelper. Introduce hideWidgets() and showWidgets() methods
for consistent management of all map widgets.
