refactor: Improve bottom sheet dialog layout and accessibility

Simplified the root layout of `bottom_sheet_dialog.xml` from
`CoordinatorLayout` to `LinearLayout`.
Added a content description for the 'touch outside' area to
improve accessibility for screen readers.
Made the content container explicitly clickable and focusable.
