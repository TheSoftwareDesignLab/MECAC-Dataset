refactor(tests): Replace Interactions.startNavigation with MapActions

The `Interactions.startNavigation()` method was removed as it directly
manipulated UI elements to start navigation, making tests brittle
and dependent on specific UI layouts.

Tests now use `app.getOsmandMap().getMapActions().startNavigation()`,
which provides a more stable and abstract way to initiate navigation,
improving test robustness and maintainability.
