feat(ui): Add description to backup data setting

Adds a descriptive text below the "Backup data" title in the backup settings screen.
This helps users understand the purpose of the setting more clearly by
displaying the `@string/select_backup_data_descr` message.
The layout was adjusted to accommodate the new summary text.
