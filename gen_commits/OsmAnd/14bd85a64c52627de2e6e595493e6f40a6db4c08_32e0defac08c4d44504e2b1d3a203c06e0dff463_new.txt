feat: Add route line appearance customization

Introduce `RouteLineAppearanceFragment` to configure route line color and width.
Implement `RouteLineColorCard` and `RouteLineWidthCard` for UI options:
- Color: default, custom (palette/picker) with day/night modes.
- Width: default, thin, medium, thick, custom (slider).
Integrate with `ProfileAppearanceFragment` to save/load settings per profile.
Enable live preview of route line changes on the map.
