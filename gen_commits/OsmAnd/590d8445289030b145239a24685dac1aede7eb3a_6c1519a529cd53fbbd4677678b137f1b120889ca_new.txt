feat(settings): Migrate show next turn info to widget-specific pref

The 'show_next_turn_info' preference has been migrated from a global (per-profile)
setting to a widget-specific setting, primarily for "street_name" widgets.
This allows users to configure whether next turn information is displayed
independently for each instance of the street name widget.

Upon upgrade, the existing 'show_next_turn_info' value for each application
profile is copied to all currently configured "street_name" widget instances
within that profile, preserving user settings. The old global preference has
been removed.
