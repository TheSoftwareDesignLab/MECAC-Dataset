feat: Add setting to disable dialog animations

Introduce new theme styles that disable window animations for dialogs.
The `applyTheme` method now checks the `DO_NOT_USE_ANIMATIONS` setting and
applies the corresponding theme variant. This allows users to disable dialog
animations for a potentially smoother experience or based on preference.
