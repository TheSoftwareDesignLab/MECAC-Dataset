feat: Enhance track menu UI with dynamic header shadow

- Implemented a dynamic bottom shadow for the track menu header, which
  appears only when scrollable content is hidden beneath it.
- Added dividers between individual GPX track segments for better visual
  separation.
- Refined header title and icon visibility logic.
- Adjusted icon gravity in the track menu layout.
