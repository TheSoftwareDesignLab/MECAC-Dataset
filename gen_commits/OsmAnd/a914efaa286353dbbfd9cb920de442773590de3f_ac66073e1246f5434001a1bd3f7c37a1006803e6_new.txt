feat: Add GPX track cards to Wikivoyage explore tab

Introduces dedicated cards for GPX tracks in the Wikivoyage explore screen.
GPX cards now display track details (distance, elevation up/down) and the track author.
Updates UI with new arrow icons for elevation, visual dividers, and consistent theming. The "View" button on GPX cards now imports the GPX file directly.
Refactored search logic to distinguish between article and track amenities using a new `ROUTE_TRACK` type and a flexible search filter.
