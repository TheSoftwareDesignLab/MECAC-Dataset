refactor: Move system UI visibility logic to AndroidUtils

Extracts methods for showing, hiding, checking, and switching system UI
visibility from MapControlsLayer to new static utility methods in
AndroidUtils. This centralizes UI control and improves reusability.

MapControlsLayer now utilizes these new AndroidUtils methods. The
`switchMapControlsVisibility` method was updated to accept a boolean
parameter, allowing conditional hiding of the map's own controls
(overlay) in addition to the system UI. ContextMenuLayer was updated
to use this new parameterized method signature.
