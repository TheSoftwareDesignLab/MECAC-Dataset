feat: Display opening hours for POIs in search results

Adds a new capability to show the current opening hours status and rule for Points of Interest (POIs) in the search results list.

- Implemented `getCurrentRuleTime()` in `OpeningHoursParser` to retrieve the active opening hour rule string.
- Modified `searchpoi_list.xml` to include dedicated UI elements for the opening hours icon and text.
- Integrated the parsing and display of opening hours into `SearchPOIActivity`, showing the status (open/closed) via icon color and the rule string.
- Refactored `DirectionDrawable` to use a more generic color ID, simplifying its color management across list items.
