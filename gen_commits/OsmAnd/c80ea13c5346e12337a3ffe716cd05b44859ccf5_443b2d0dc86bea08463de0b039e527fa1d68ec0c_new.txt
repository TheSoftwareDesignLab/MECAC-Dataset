zoom adjustments beyond integer steps.

- Added `zoomFloatPart` to `RotatedTileBox` and `OsmandSettings`.
- Updated `OsmandMapTileView`, `AnimateDraggingMapThread`, and `OsmandAidlApi`
  to handle and propagate fractional zoom.
- Implemented a new `Zoom` utility class to manage zoom calculations
  and bounds, including animated fractional zoom.
- Enhanced `ZoomLevelWidget` to display the fractional zoom part.
- Persists fractional zoom in user settings.
