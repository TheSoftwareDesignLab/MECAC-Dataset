feat: Implement undo for map marker history operations

Adds a Snackbar with an "Undo" action for map marker history operations.
Users can now revert accidental removal or restoration of markers from history.

- Introduces `addMarker()` method in `MapMarkersHelper` to support re-adding markers.
- Ensures the undo Snackbar is dismissed when navigating to active markers.
