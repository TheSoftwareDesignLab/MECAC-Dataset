feat: Add GPX track save notification and improve UI theming

- Display a success notification with the save timestamp after a GPX track is saved.
- Refactor GPX monitoring notification handling into a static method and a dedicated broadcast receiver.
- Enhance UI elements across POI editing fragments and general styling for better theme consistency and dark mode support.
- Standardize background colors and dividers using theme attributes like `?attr/spinnerListBackground`, `?attr/bg_color`, `?attr/dashboard_divider`, and `?android:textColorSecondary`.
- Update various icon colors to use `R.color.dash_search_icon_dark` for improved visibility.
- Remove hardcoded text colors from buttons, relying on theme attributes.
- Corrected `android:theme` to `osmand:theme` attribute in `fragment_edit_poi_normal.xml`.
- Fixed typo in `NestedScrollView` comment in `fragment_edit_poi_normal.xml`.
- Updated Russian translation for "POI Name" from "Имя" to "Название".
