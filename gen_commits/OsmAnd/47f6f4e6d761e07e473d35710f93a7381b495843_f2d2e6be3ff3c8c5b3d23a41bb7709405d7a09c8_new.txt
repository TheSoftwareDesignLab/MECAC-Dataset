refactor: Improve landscape map HUD layout with RelativeLayout

Switches the root layout of map_hud_bottom.xml from LinearLayout to RelativeLayout for landscape orientation. This enables more precise and flexible positioning of elements such as zoom controls, my location button, and bottom widgets. It also adjusts the placement of the move_marker_bottom_sheet.
