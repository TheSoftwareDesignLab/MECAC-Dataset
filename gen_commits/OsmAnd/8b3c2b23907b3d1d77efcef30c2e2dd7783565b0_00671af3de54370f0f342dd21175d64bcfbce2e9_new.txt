refactor: Optimize quick action execution and layer state

Removed redundant `super.execute()` call in `SwitchProfileAction`, ensuring actions are executed correctly and only once.
Enhanced `MapQuickActionLayer.setLayerState()` to proactively check the widget's current state. This prevents unnecessary UI updates if the quick action widget is already in the desired visibility state, improving efficiency.
