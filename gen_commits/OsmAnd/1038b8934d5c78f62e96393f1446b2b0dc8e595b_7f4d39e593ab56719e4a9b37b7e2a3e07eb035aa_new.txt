feat: Add "Attach to Roads" banner for GPX tracks

Introduces a new banner card to encourage users to attach their GPX tracks to roads. This banner appears on the Route Info and Route Directions cards when a GPX track is loaded but its points do not have `profileType` defined, indicating it's not yet snapped. Clicking the banner opens the Measurement Tool in snap-to-roads mode for the current GPX track.

A new utility method `GPXUtilities.GPXFile.GpxData#isAttachedToRoads()` was added to determine the track's status. Additionally, `MeasurementToolFragment.openSnapToRoads()` was introduced to standardize opening the snap-to-roads functionality.
