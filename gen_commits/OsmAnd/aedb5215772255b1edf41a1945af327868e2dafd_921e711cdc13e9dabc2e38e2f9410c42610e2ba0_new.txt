refactor: Expand terrain description button clickable area

- Wrapped the "Get" button in a new LinearLayout to provide a larger, more accessible click target.
- Updated the click listener in `ViewCreator` to target this new clickable area.
- Added `lineSpacingExtra` to the description text for improved readability.
- Changed the description image gravity to `top` for better alignment.
- Adjusted `mtrl_slider_track_side_padding` to a fixed `8dp`.
