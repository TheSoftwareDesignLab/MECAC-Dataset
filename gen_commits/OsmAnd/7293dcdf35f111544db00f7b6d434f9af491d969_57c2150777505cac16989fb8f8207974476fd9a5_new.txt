feat: Move search & navigation actions to ActionBar

Migrates various search and navigation buttons from layout XMLs to ActionBar
menu items across several fragments, improving UI consistency.

- Refactors `NavigatePointFragment`, `SearchAddressFragment`, and
  `SearchAddressOnlineFragment` to use ActionBar for actions like
  "Navigate To", "Show On Map", "Add Waypoint", "Search Online/Offline",
  and "Clear Search".
- Introduces distinct "Add Waypoint" options for existing routes.
- Streamlines setting a single destination using `TargetPointsHelper.setSingleDestination`.
- Adds validation toast for actions without a selected address.
- Enables split action bar for `SearchActivity` and `SearchAddressActivity`.
- Bumps `versionCode` to 145.
