feat: Improve route distance and straight path calculations

Enhance `getDistanceToFinish` to use `currentStraightAnglePoint` for more accurate remaining distance.
Refactor distance calculation methods to reuse `getDistanceToFinish`.
Significantly increase `MIN_STRAIGHT_DIST` to 50km for simplified straight route generation.
Adjust `findStraightRoute` logic to correctly handle segment accumulation with the new `MIN_STRAIGHT_DIST`.
