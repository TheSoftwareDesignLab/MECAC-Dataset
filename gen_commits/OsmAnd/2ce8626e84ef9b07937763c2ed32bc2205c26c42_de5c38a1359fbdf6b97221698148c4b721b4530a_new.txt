feat: Add option to share live location as text message

Introduces a new setting to choose how live location updates are shared:
- As an interactive map message.
- As a formatted text message.
- As both map and text messages.

This change enables the app to send location data directly as formatted text messages, which include coordinates, altitude, speed, and update timestamps. Text messages from other users containing similar location information can now also be parsed and displayed on the map layer.

Refactors internal `ShareChatInfo` to manage separate message IDs for map and text messages and updates message processing accordingly.
