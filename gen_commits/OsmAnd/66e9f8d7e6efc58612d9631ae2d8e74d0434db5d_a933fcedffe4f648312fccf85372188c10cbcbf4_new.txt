chore: Improve Dutch translations

Refined various Dutch strings in the core application and the Parking plugin.
Specifically:
- Changed "acceleratie" to "versnelling" for route animation speedup.
- Translated several English terms to Dutch in the Parking plugin (e.g., "No" to "Nee", "Yes" to "Ja").
- Corrected "Osmand" to "OsmAnd" for consistent capitalization.
