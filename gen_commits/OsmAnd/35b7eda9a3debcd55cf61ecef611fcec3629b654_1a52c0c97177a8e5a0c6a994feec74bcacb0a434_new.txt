feat: Enhance pixel coordinate precision in map calculations

Changed RotatedTileBox methods (e.g., getPixXFromLatLon, getPixYFromTile) to return float for greater accuracy.
Updated callers to explicitly cast these values to int where integer pixel coordinates are needed.
Fixed RouteLayer to avoid drawing arrows during zoom animations.
