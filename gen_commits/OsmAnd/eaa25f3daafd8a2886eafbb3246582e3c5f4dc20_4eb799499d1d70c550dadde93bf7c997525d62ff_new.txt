feat: Implement fractional zoom for smoother map interaction

Introduced `zoomFloatPart` to allow sub-integer zoom levels.
Updated map rendering, animation, and auto-zoom logic to support and animate fractional zooms.
Refined animation durations for smoother transitions.
Improved map vector layer drawing by switching to LatLon-based coordinates.
Adjusted default auto-zoom for car mode and added max zoom limits.
Fixed an issue with rendering rules merging in `RenderingRulesStorage`.
