fix: Adjust item width in Add Point bottom sheet for landscape

Correctly calculates the width of items in the Add Point bottom sheet when in landscape orientation. Previously, it used half of the screen width, which is incorrect when the bottom sheet has a fixed width. This change ensures two items fit per row by using half of the bottom sheet's width, accounting for shadow.
