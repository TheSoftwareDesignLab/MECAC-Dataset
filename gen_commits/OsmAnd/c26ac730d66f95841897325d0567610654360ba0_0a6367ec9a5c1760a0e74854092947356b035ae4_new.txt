feat: Implement dynamic custom rendering properties and settings UI

Removed the obsolete OsmandRenderingRulesParser.
Introduced dynamic custom rendering properties, allowing renderers to expose configurable options in the settings UI.
Refactored rendering rule storage to support custom properties and correctly load dependent renderers.
Reorganized map settings into logical categories (Raster, Vector, Overlay, Vector Rendering) for better usability.
Updated the default rendering style `new_default.render.xml` with appMode-specific rules for car, bicycle, and pedestrian profiles, adjusting detail and styling for various map features.
Removed 'Show more map detail' and 'Continuous rendering' preferences.
