feat: Improve parking point context menu display

Refactors how time-related information is shown in the map context menu.
Replaces specific `getLimitedTimeInfo` and `isLimitedTime` with a generic approach using `getAdditionalTypeStr`, `displayAdditionalTypeStrInHours`, and `getTimeStrColor`.

The parking point feature now utilizes this new mechanism to:
- Display "Pick up till" time or "Parking position" in the menu title.
- Show remaining time or "Without time limit" in the time information section with appropriate styling.
- Update the parking start description to include "parked at".
- Add new `parked_at` and `pick_up_till` strings.
