feat: Improve accessibility for map mode toggles

Introduced `contentDescription` to `RadioItem` and propagated it to `MultiStateToggleButton` buttons. This ensures Day/Night mode options in the map mode fragment are more descriptive for screen reader users.
Adjusted `fragment_map_mode.xml` to use `wrap_content` with a `minHeight` and removed a redundant spacing view for better layout flexibility.
