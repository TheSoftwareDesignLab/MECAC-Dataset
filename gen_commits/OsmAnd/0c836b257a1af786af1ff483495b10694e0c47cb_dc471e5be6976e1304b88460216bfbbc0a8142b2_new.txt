fix: Detach MapRenderer target changed listener

Ensure the MapRendererTargetChangedObservable listener is properly
detached when the MapActivity is set to null. This prevents potential
resource leaks and ensures correct lifecycle management for the layer.
A dedicated field and tag are used to manage the observable.
