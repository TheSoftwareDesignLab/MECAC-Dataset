feat: Enhance Android Auto "Continue Navigation" button

The "Continue Navigation" button in Android Auto's Landing Screen now appears when a route is calculated, even if `FOLLOW_THE_ROUTE` is disabled. Clicking this button in such a state will now correctly initiate navigation from the calculated route.
