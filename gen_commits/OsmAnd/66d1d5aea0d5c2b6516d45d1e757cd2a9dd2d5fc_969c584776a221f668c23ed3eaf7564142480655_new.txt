fix: Correct text shadow rendering and weather widget init

Initialize the WeatherWidget with a NO_VALUE state upon creation to prevent it from appearing blank.
Force an immediate redraw of text shadows in MapWidget after their styling properties are updated. This addresses a rendering issue where text shadows might not appear correctly until the widget's text is explicitly changed. Removed redundant visibility setting for text shadows.
