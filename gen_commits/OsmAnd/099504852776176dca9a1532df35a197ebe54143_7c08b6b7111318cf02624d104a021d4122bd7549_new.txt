feat: Add hierarchical navigation for Wikivoyage articles

Introduce a new article navigation feature that allows users to explore the hierarchical "part of" structure of Wikivoyage articles.

- Implements `WikivoyageArticleNavigationFragment` to display parent and sibling articles in an expandable list.
- Integrates a new JavaScript interface within the article WebView to launch the navigation dialog.
- Adds `nav-bar` styling and HTML structure to the article content, indicating its place in the hierarchy.
- Refactor various request codes and intent keys across Wikivoyage fragments for improved clarity and consistency.
- Remove redundant divider views and associated logic in article content list items.
