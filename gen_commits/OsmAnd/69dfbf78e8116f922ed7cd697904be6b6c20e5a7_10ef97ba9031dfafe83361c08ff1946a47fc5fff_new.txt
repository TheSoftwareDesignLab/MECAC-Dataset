feat: Enhance default track appearance save options

Refactor the confirmation flow for saving default track appearance settings.
The old generic `ConfirmChangesBottomSheet` has been replaced with a new `ConfirmDefaultAppearanceBottomSheet` specifically for track appearance.
Users can now choose to apply default appearance changes only to newly created tracks or to all existing tracks within the folder.

Additionally:
- Removed unused `change_default_tracks_appearance_confirmation_description` string.
- Updated divider background attribute and removed start margin in `popup_menu_item.xml`.
