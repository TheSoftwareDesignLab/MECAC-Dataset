refactor: Simplify and make screen on settings profile-specific

Removed the dedicated 'Turn screen on router' preference.
The 'Turn screen on time' setting now implicitly controls screen wake-up on voice messages during navigation; a value greater than 0 enables this.
The 'Turn screen on time' and 'Turn screen on sensor' preferences are now tied to application profiles.
The 'Turn screen on sensor' feature is now only active when actively following a route.
Refactored screen power lock management in MapActivity lifecycle.
