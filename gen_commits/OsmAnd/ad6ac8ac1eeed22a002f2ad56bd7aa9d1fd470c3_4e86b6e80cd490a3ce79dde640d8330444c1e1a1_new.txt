refactor: Replace PointF with individual floats for touch coordinates

Refactor multi-touch handling to use individual float coordinates instead of PointF objects. This change reduces object allocation during frequent touch events. OsmandMapTileView now stores touch points as float x/y pairs and uses a 'twoFingersTouch' flag. LatLon conversion for touch points is now performed on-demand.
