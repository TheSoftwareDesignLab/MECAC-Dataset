feat(ui): Redesign Plan Route screen for landscape

Refactors the Plan Route UI to use a fixed-width dashboard-like panel in landscape mode.
This replaces the previous bottom sheet-like behavior, introducing a dedicated toolbar within the panel for improved usability.
The fragment now adapts its container and internal layout based on the device's orientation.
