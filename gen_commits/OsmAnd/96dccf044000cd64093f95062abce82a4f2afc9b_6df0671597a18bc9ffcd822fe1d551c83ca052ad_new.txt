fix: Prevent UI blocking during SQLite tile insertion

Introduced a locking mechanism for SQLiteTileSource during tile insertion to avoid concurrent access issues. ResourceManager now checks this lock before attempting to read from a locked database.

Simplified OsmandMapTileView.tileDownloaded to always perform a full map refresh. This prevents UI blocking that could occur when partial refreshes conflicted with SQLite tile insertion operations, ensuring a more responsive user experience.
