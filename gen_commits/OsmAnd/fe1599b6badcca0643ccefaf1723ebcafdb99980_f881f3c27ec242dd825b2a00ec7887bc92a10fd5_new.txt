refactor: Unify target point drawing logic

Centralizes the drawing implementation for start, intermediate, and target points into a single `drawPointImpl` method.
Introduces `ShiftedBitmap` to encapsulate bitmaps and their drawing offsets, reducing code duplication.
Applies `instanceof` pattern matching for improved code readability.
