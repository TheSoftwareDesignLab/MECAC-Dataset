feat: Implement auto-zoom and application mode specific UI

Implemented auto-zoom for the map based on vehicle speed.
Location icon (circle and direction arrow) now adapts its size and appearance based on the selected application mode (Car, Bicycle, Default).
Refactored the settings screen by converting preference categories into clickable PreferenceScreens with descriptive summaries, improving navigation and clarity.
Updated ToDoConstants to mark these features as completed.
