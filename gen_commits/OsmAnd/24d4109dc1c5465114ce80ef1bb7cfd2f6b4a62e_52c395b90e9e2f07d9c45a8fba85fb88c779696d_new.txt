feat: Ruler shows 0 distance when map is tracking location

When the map is linked to the user's current location, the ruler widget
will now explicitly display "0" distance. This prevents showing any
distance when the map center should align with the current location.

Additionally:
- Refactored distance text formatting into a reusable `calculateAndSetText` method.
- Improved ruler update logic by using `RotatedTileBox.isZoomAnimated()`
  instead of `MapView.isZooming()` to check for ongoing zoom animations.
