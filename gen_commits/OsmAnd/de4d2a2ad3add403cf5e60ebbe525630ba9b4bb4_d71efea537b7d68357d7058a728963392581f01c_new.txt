fix: Defer search filter processing during active tasks

- Implements deferred processing of text changes in the search filter
  by storing them in `tChange` when a `currentSearchTask` is active.
  These pending changes are applied upon completion of the search task.
- Ensures the search button's enabled state is correctly managed,
  preventing new searches from being triggered while a task is running.
- Enhances the search button's label to display the actual query term
  for name searches, improving user clarity.
- Addresses potential race conditions and inconsistent UI states.
