refactor: Streamline widget management with direct WidgetType usage

Introduce direct usage of WidgetType enum in `ApplicationMode.regWidgetVisibility` and `regWidgetAvailability`. Refactor widget panel containment checks into new `WidgetsPanel.contains()` methods for clarity. Add `isExternal()` methods to `MapWidget` and `MapWidgetInfo` for explicit identification of external widgets. Update relevant call sites and listener interfaces to leverage these improvements and enhance null safety with `@NonNull` annotations.
