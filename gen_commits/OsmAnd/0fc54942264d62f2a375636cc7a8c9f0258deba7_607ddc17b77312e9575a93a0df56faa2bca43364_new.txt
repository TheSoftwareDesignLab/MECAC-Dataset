refactor: Remove ExternalServiceAPI and InternalOsmAndAPI

This commit simplifies the application's API by removing the ExternalServiceAPI and
InternalOsmAndAPI layers. Functionality previously provided by these interfaces has been
relocated or directly accessed:

- Internet/WiFi connectivity, external storage, and light sensor checks now reside
  within OsmandSettings or use direct Android SDK calls.
- Amenity search operations are now delegated to ResourceManager.
- Navigation service control is performed via direct Intent calls.
- ClientContext references have largely been replaced with OsmandApplication for
  simpler dependency management where appropriate.
- A dedicated AudioFocusHelper interface was introduced for audio focus management.

This change reduces abstraction and improves code clarity.
