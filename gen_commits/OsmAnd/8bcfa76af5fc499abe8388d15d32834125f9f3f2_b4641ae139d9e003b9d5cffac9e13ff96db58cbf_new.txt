feat: Enable navigation from Wikivoyage article group headers

Wikivoyage navigation group headers are now clickable. If a header corresponds to an existing article, the user will be navigated to it. If the article is not found (e.g., only a part of a larger region), a "Article not found" toast message will be displayed.

This change involved refactoring the navigation map keys from `String` to `WikivoyageSearchResult` objects to store the necessary article details for direct navigation.
