feat(elevation-profile): Enhance widget with live route tracking

The elevation profile widget now dynamically updates its graph and statistics
based on the user's current location along a calculated route.

- Graph automatically scrolls and highlights the current position on the route.
- Uphill, downhill, and grade statistics are localized to the visible graph portion or current position.
- Introduced `BaseCommonGraphAdapter` to consolidate common graph update logic.
- Implemented a default zoom level for the graph, showing up to 10km.
- Widget is notified on route calculation to re-initialize the graph.
