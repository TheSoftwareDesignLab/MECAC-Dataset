fix: Update map and UI on display configuration changes

- Introduce `updateDisplayMetrics` in `OsmandMapTileView` to handle density, width, and height changes.
- Notify `OsmandMapTileView` when display density changes in `OsmandApplication`.
- Ensure `DistanceRulerControlLayer` re-evaluates text sizes on resource updates.
- This improves rendering and scaling of the map and associated UI elements when
  display metrics change during runtime, such as on device rotation or in
  multi-window mode.
