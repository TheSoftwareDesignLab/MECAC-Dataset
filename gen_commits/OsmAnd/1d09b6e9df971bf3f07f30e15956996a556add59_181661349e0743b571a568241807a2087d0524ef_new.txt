refactor: Migrate Save GPX fragment to MenuBottomSheet

- Renames `OnSaveCurrentTrackFragment` and its layout to `SaveGPXBottomSheetFragment`.
- Adapts the fragment to extend `MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment`, utilizing its generic
  mechanism for bottom action buttons instead of custom layout definitions.
- Improves consistency with other bottom sheet dialogs.
