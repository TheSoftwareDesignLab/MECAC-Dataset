feat: Improve rendering of motorway junction labels

Adjusts minimum zoom levels and text sizes for `highway=motorway_junction`:
- Car mode `ref` labels now appear from zoom 12 (was 13).
- Other car mode labels appear from zoom 13 (was 14).
- Generic labels appear from zoom 13 (was 14) with text size 13 (was 14).
This enhances label visibility and map readability at various zoom levels.
