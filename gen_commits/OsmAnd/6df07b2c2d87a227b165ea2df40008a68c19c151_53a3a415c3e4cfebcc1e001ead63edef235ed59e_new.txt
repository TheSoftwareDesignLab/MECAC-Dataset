feat(plugins): Detect and enable Parking Plugin dynamically

The Parking Position Plugin is now detected at runtime using PackageManager.
It will only be initialized and enabled if the 'net.osmand.parkingPlugin'
application is installed on the device, allowing it to be an optional,
separately installed component.

Additionally, the external Parking Plugin application now calls `stopService()`
before launching OsmAnd or the Play Store, improving resource management.
