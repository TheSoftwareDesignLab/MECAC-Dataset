feat: Add context menu pin marker to map

Introduces a visual pin marker that appears on the map when the context menu is shown.
The marker is initialized using JNI MapMarker and SwigUtilities to render an Android drawable.

Changes include:
- Integration of `MapMarker` and `MapMarkersCollection` for the context pin.
- Utility methods to convert Android Drawables to byte arrays for JNI `SkBitmap`.
- Displaying the pin when the context menu is active and hiding it when closed.
- Corrected long press coordinates calculation on the map view.
- Added a check to prevent long press activation during multi-touch gestures.
- Hide the context menu automatically when the map is scrolled.
