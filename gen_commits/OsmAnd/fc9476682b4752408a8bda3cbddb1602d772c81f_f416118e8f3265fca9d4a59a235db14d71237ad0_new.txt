refactor: Move arrival distance setting to navigation_settings.xml

The 'arrival_distance_factor' preference was previously added programmatically
in 'SettingsAccessibilityActivity.java'. This change relocates its definition
to 'navigation_settings.xml' for better organization and consistency with
other navigation preferences.
