feat: Improve map zoom transitions and precision

Reworked zoom calculation to extend the fractional zoom range before changing the base zoom level. This provides smoother map zoom transitions by reducing abrupt jumps.
Map renderer now receives zoom as a base `ZoomLevel` enum and a `visualZoom` float for enhanced precision, also accounting for map density via `visualZoomShift`.
