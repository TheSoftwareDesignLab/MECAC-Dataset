fix: Prevent newlines in distance formatter and refactor UI

Ensures formatted distance values do not contain unwanted newline characters by replacing them with spaces.

Further UI improvements include:
- Changing the default button background from white to darker_gray.
- Introducing configurable padding for radio buttons to enhance visual alignment, with differentiated values for API 17+ and older versions.
