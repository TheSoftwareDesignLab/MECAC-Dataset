feat(uk): Add strings for tracking, timeline, and monitoring

- Reformat `strings.xml` for consistent indentation and newlines.
- Update `welcome_descr` to reflect the app name change to "OsmAnd Tracker".
- Adjust `disconnect_from_telegram` for improved terminology (tracking instead of sharing).
- Add new strings for GPS points, timeline, monitoring, and general UI elements.
