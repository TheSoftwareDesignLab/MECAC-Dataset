feat: Unified location and compass management

Introduces OsmAndLocationProvider to centralize all location and sensor
data handling. Extracts location update and compass logic from MapActivity
and NavigationService. Map view tracking and auto-mode features are now
managed by MapViewTrackingUtilities. RouteAnimation renamed to
OsmAndLocationSimulation and integrated with the new provider.
