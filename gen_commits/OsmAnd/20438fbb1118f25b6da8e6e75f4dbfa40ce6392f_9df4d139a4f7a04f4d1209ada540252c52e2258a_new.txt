fix: Always show unsaved track distance in monitoring widget

Previously, the monitoring widget would clear the displayed track distance
once recording was paused or stopped, even if the track hadn't been saved.
This change ensures that the widget continues to show the accumulated
distance of an unsaved track (if `dist > 0`), while the icon correctly
reflects the current recording state (active/inactive).
