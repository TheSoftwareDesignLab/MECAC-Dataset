refactor(poi): Remove legacy editing_poi.xml layout

The outdated 'editing_poi.xml' UI layout for POI editing has been removed.
This commit also includes various minor UI cleanups in 'poi_tag_list_item.xml' and 'save_directions_dialog.xml'.
Additionally, a broad update was applied to multiple language string resources, replacing standard ellipsis '...' with the proper Unicode ellipsis '…' for consistency and readability. Some strings were also wrapped in CDATA blocks for correct XML parsing.
