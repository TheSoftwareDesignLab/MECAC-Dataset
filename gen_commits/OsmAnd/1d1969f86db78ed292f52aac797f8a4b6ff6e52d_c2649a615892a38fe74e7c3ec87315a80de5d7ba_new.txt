feat: Adjust dynamic map zoom levels based on speed

Modified defineZoomFromSpeed to provide a wider field of view at higher speeds. The map now zooms out more aggressively across speed ranges.

- Speeds < 23 km/h now show zoom 17 (previously < 33 km/h).
- Speeds < 43 km/h now show zoom 16 (previously < 53 km/h).
- Speeds < 63 km/h now show zoom 15 (previously < 83 km/h).
- Speeds < 83 km/h now show zoom 14 (new range).
- Speeds >= 83 km/h now show zoom 13 (previously 14).
