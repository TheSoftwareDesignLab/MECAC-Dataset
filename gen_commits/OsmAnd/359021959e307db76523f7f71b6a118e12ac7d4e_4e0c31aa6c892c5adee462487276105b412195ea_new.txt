refactor: Improve local item size calculation and display

Moves size calculation limit logic from CollectLocalIndexesAlgorithm and CollectLocalIndexesRules directly into LocalItem. This simplifies the collection algorithm and centralizes size state management.

- LocalItem now holds its size calculation limit and determines if it's reached.
- LocalGroup checks child items to determine if its total size is fully calculated.
- Introduces BaseLocalItem#getSizeDescription() for consistent formatting, including the "≥" prefix when limits are hit.
- Increases TILES_SIZE_CALCULATION_LIMIT from 5MB to 50MB for more accurate tile file sizes.
