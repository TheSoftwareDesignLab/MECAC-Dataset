refactor: Implement map controls as a dedicated layer

Moved map zoom and back-to-menu buttons from XML layouts and `OsmZoomControls`
to a new `MapControlsLayer`. This layer now programmatically manages their
display and interaction, providing a more integrated approach with other
map view layers.

Includes new drawable assets for standard and HDPI button states.
Also, set `android:debuggable="true"` in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
