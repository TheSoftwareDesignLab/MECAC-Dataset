feat: Announce GPS location loss during navigation

- Implements voice notification when the GPS signal is lost or becomes inaccurate for a defined period while actively navigating.
- Introduces a delayed check in `MapActivity` using `LOST_LOCATION_MSG_ID` and `LOST_LOCATION_CHECK_DELAY`.
- Adds `gpsLocationLost()` methods to `VoiceRouter` and `CommandBuilder` for triggering the announcement.
- Includes `VoiceCommandPending` to ensure initial voice commands are queued and played once the player is ready.
- Updates `ToDoConstants` with a new voice activity test reminder.
