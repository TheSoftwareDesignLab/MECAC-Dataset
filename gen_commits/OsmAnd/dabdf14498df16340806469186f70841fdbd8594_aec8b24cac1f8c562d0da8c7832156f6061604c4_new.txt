feat: Grid color palette respects night mode preview

Introduce a 'forcedNightMode' into CoordinatesGridHelper to allow
external components to temporarily override the global night mode
setting. This is used by GridColorController to ensure the grid
colors are previewed correctly when switching between day and night
color palettes within the configuration screen.
Reset forced night mode when the color palette screen is closed.
Refactor MapColorPaletteController to capture initial night mode
in the constructor, rather than on resume.
