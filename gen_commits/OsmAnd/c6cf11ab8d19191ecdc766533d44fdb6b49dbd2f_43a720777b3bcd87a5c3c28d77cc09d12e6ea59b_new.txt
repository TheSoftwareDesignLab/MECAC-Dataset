refactor: Streamline map language preference handling

Consolidate logic for map language and transliteration preferences.
Removed individual methods for transliteration and app locale usage, integrating their behavior into the LanguagePreference enum.
The renderer now directly uses a LanguagePreference object from 'getMapLanguageSetting'.
Introduced 'DETAILED_MAP_ZOOM' to differentiate basemaps from detailed maps, with basemaps consistently using 'LocalizedOrTransliterated' preference.
Ensure map rendering providers are fully recreated upon language parameter changes.
