feat: Redesign map mode selection and add 'App theme' option

Replaces the existing map day/night mode selection dialog with a new dedicated `MapModeFragment`.
Introduces `MapModeController` to handle the logic and UI state for map theme selection.
Adds a new "App theme" option, allowing the map to follow the global app theme (light/dark).
Enhances `DayNightMode` enum to support distinct default and selected icons for improved UI.
Updates `IconToggleButton` and related widgets to support the new icon selection logic.
Refactors fragment dismissal and controller unregistration logic for consistency.
