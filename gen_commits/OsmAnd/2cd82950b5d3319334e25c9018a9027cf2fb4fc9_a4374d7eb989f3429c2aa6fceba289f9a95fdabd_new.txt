feat: Add clear search button and result persistence to online address

- Introduced a "Clear Search" button on the online address search layout.
- This button allows users to quickly clear the search input field and any displayed results.
- Implemented logic to persist the last online search results when switching tabs or recreating the activity, improving user experience.
- The soft keyboard is now automatically hidden after initiating an online search.
- Refactored `SearchActivity` to manage online/offline address search state more cleanly.
