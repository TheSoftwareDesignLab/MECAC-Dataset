refactor: Streamline plugin names and update UI text

Removed redundant `_name` string resources for plugins. Plugin names now reuse
existing, more general preference strings for consistency.
Applied minor text adjustments, including:
- Corrected capitalization for "Left-hand driving".
- Updated "power saving" to "sleep" in background plugin description.
- Renamed "OSM" to "OSM Editing" in various contexts.
- Renamed "Background Settings" to "Sleep Mode Functionality".
