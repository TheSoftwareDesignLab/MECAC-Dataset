fix: Adjust shared location formatting for RTL locales

Removes a hardcoded newline from the Farsi 'location' string resource.
Introduces dynamic insertion of a newline character before the shared
location URL specifically for Right-to-Left (RTL) locales.
This prevents formatting issues and ensures proper readability when
sharing location information in RTL languages.
