refactor: Update 'Clear Search' to 'New Search' UI text

The `search_offline_clear_search` string was updated in `strings.xml`.
The English text was changed from "Clear Search" to "New Search" to better reflect the action of initiating a new search.
The string definition was also relocated within the file.
Added Slovak translation "Nové hľadanie".
