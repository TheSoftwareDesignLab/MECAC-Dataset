feat: Improve widget collision resolution and control

- Rewrites `moveButton` logic for more robust overlapping widget resolution.
- Introduces `setNonMoveable()` to prevent specific widgets from being repositioned by the algorithm.
- Applies `setNonMoveable()` to main UI panels (e.g., top/bottom/side panels, measurement bar) to ensure their fixed positions.
- Enables the new `ALTERNATIVE_ALGORITHM` by default for better layout management.
