feat: Add support for selecting and navigating GPX routes

- Renamed `FailSafeFuntions` to `FailSafeFunctions` (typo fix).
- Introduced `GPX_ROUTE_INDEX` setting and renamed `GPX_ROUTE_SEGMENT` to `GPX_SEGMENT_INDEX`.
- Refactored `TrackSelectSegmentBottomSheet` and `TrackSelectSegmentAdapter` to display and allow selection of both GPX routes and segments.
- Updated `GPXRouteParamsBuilder` and associated routing logic to handle selected routes.
- Modified UI elements and helpers (e.g., MapRouteInfoMenu, TrackEditCard) to reflect the selected route/segment.
- Added `GpxNavigationHelper.startNavigationForRoute` and updated related navigation methods.
