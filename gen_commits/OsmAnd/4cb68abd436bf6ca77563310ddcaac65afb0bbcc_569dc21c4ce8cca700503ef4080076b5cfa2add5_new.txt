fix(chart): Preserve view after drag/rotate gestures

The chart's zoom and pan state were incorrectly reset after drag or rotate gestures, despite the view matrix being saved.
This commit adjusts the `refreshChart` call to prevent the unintended view reset, ensuring the user's manipulated chart view is retained.
Additionally, a local variable `nextHighlightPos` was renamed to `pos` for better clarity.
