feat: Refine next turn widget text formatting and exit size

Extracts distance text comma logic into formatSubText() to ensure a comma
is only appended for the small widget size. For medium and large widgets,
a trailing comma will now be removed. Reduces the exit number text size
from 24sp to 18sp in the small navigation widget layout.
