refactor: Simplify search result similarity radius logic

Consolidate and refactor the conditions for determining the similarity radius
in `sameSearchResult` method. This change groups checks for 'natural' type
and various 'route_hiking_n_poi', 'cn_ref', 'wn_ref' sub-types, improving
readability and reducing redundancy.
