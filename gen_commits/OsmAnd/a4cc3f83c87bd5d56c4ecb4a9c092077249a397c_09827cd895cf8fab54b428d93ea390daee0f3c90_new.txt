refactor: Unify GPX item layouts and streamline action menus

Standardized padding, margins, and element ordering across GPX item layouts. Replaced hardcoded dimensions with resource references. Moved "Split interval" action into the overflow menu and converted the overflow trigger from an ImageButton to a TextViewEx.
