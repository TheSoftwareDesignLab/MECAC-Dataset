feat: Add Widget Info screen with detailed view and actions

This commit introduces a new "Widget Info" screen, providing a dedicated view for each map widget.
The screen displays:
- A detailed description of the widget's functionality.
- Direct access to widget-specific settings.
- Actions to duplicate the widget (including its current configuration) or remove it.

To support this feature:
- New description strings have been added for various map widget types.
- Widget types and groups have been updated to reference these descriptions.
- `copyPrefs` methods have been implemented in `WidgetState` subclasses to allow duplicating widget settings.
- The info button in the widgets list now opens this new screen.
