refactor: Move target point by re-adding via TargetPointsHelper

Instead of directly updating the target point's location and manually triggering
a route recalculation via `RoutingHelper`, this change delegates the update
process to `TargetPointsHelper`. The old waypoint is now removed and a new
one is navigated to at the updated position, ensuring `TargetPointsHelper`
manages the state and triggers any necessary route re-evaluation.
