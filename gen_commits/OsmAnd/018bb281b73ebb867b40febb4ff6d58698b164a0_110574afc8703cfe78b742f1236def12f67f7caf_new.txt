refactor: Use OutlinedTextContainer for route info widget texts

The `OutlinedTextContainer` has been enhanced to host and configure
specialized `TextView` subclasses, specifically `MultiTextViewEx`.
This refactoring applies the improved container to all route
information widgets.

Key changes:
- Route info widget layouts updated to use `OutlinedTextContainer`.
- `attrs.xml` extended with `multiTextViewEx_` attributes for `OutlinedTextContainer`.
- `OutlinedTextContainer` logic updated to parse and apply child-specific attributes.
- `MultiTextViewEx` enhanced with an `init` method for programmatic configuration.
