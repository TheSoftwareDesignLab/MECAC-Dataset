feat: Add configurable priority for displaying route destinations

Refactor route information calculation to allow prioritizing the display order
of intermediate and final destination points in the RouteInfoWidget.

- Introduced `calculateRouteInformation(@NonNull DisplayPriority priority)`
  method in `RouteInfoCalculator` to explicitly order results.
- Refactored point collection into new helper methods (`getCurrentIntermediateInfo`,
  `getFinalDestinationInfo`, `collectNotPassedIntermediatePoints(int limit)`)
  for clearer logic and reusability.
- `RouteInfoWidget` now retrieves and applies the configured `DisplayPriority`
  when updating route information.
