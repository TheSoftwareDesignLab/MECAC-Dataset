feat: Improve small widget display and readability

Adjust visibility of small widget names and units to prevent truncation when their width is below a threshold (15dp).
Introduces a 'full row' state for SimpleWidgets, allowing them to adjust their layout when they are the only widget visible in a row within the VerticalWidgetPanel.
