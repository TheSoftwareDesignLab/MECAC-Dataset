refactor: Improve UI theming and map controls theme integration

Standardize background attribute usage to `?attr/bg_color` across various layouts.
Refactor `MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment` to programmatically create background drawables, combining colors and shadows for better flexibility.
Introduce `MapControlsLayer.MapControlsThemeInfoProvider` to allow active fragments to dictate the night/day mode for map controls.
Clean up redundant background overrides in child fragments and adjust specific component colors for consistency.
