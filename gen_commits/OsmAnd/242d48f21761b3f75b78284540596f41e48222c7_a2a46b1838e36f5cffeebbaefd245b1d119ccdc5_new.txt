feat(ui): More descriptive profile subtitles in settings

Enhances the readability of application mode descriptions in the settings by:
- Using a specific "base profile" string for root modes.
- Showing the parent profile for derived modes.
- Appending specific routing information (e.g., "car") for derived modes if available.
This provides users with a clearer understanding of each profile's type and origin.
