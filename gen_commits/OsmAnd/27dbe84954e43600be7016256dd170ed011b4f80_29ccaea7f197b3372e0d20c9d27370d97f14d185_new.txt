refactor(track): Optimize resource access in TrackPointsCard

- Removed redundant class-level `Resources` field.
- Introduced local `Resources` variable in `getGroupView`.
- Cached dimension pixel sizes to reduce repeated calls.
- Utilized `AndroidUtils.setMargins` for consistent layout margin application.
