refactor: Rename multi-touch zoom mode to include rotation

The `inZoomMode` variable and `isInZoomMode()` method in `MultiTouchSupport` were renamed to `inZoomAndRotationMode` and `isInZoomAndRotationMode()` respectively. This clarifies that this mode handles both pinch zoom and map rotation gestures.

A new helper method `isPinchZoomingOrRotating()` was added to `OsmandMapTileView` for convenience. Related variables in `DistanceRulerControlLayer` were also updated for consistency.
