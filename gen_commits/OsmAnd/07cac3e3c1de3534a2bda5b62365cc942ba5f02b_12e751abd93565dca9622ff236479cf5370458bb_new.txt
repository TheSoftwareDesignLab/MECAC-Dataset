fix: Prevent route info dialog from showing with active target

The route info dialog would automatically show if the 'showDialog' flag was true, even when a specific navigation target was already active. This change adds a check to ensure the dialog only appears if no specific 'pointToNavigate' is set, improving the user experience by avoiding redundant dialog displays.
