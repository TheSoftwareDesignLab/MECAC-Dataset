feat: Enhance GPX approximation with app mode and refactor file utils

The `GpxApproximationFragment` now accepts an optional `ApplicationMode` to improve snapping to road calculations. This allows for more context-aware approximation based on the active routing profile.

Specifically, the `MeasurementToolFragment` determines the relevant `ApplicationMode` to pass, defaulting to `null` for `DEFAULT` or `public_transport` profiles.

Additionally, file extension trimming logic has been consolidated. The redundant `AndroidUtils.trimExtension` method was removed, and all usages now refer to the more robust `Algorithms.getFileNameWithoutExtension` method, which also received null-safety improvements.
