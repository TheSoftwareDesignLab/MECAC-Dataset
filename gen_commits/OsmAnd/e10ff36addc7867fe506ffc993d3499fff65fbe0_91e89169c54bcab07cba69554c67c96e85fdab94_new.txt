feat: Implement max width for dialog layouts

Introduces `ExpandableLinearLayout` to provide a maximum visible width for UI elements, improving responsiveness on larger screens (e.g., tablets).

Applied to `navigate_point.xml` and `search_address.xml` to center content and limit its width to 800dp. This ensures layouts adapt better to various screen sizes.

In `search_address.xml`, individual `ExpandableButton` components were replaced with standard `Button`s, as the parent `ExpandableLinearLayout` now manages the overall width constraint.

Includes a minor fix in `ExpandableButton.java` to correctly apply `maxWidth` only when it's greater than zero.
