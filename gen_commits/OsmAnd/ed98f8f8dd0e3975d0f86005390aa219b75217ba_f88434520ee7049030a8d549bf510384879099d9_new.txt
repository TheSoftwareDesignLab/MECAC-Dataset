feat: Add dedicated UI for GPX track and folder selection

Introduces `SelectTrackFragment` and `SelectTrackFolderFragment` to provide a unified UI for browsing and selecting GPX tracks and folders.

This change:
- Replaces various track selection dialogs with a consistent, browsable interface.
- Consolidates common track management logic into a new `BaseTracksFragment`.
- Integrates new selection flow into Measurement Tool, Location Simulation, and Simulate Location fragment.
- Allows browsing through GPX folders for easier track management.
