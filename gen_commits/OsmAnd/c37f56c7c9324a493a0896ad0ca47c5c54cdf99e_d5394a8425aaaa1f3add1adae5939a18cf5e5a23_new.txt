refactor: Move map positioning logic to MapHelper

Introduces `MapHelper` to encapsulate map centering and marker adjustment logic for the map context menu. This centralizes calculations, considering UI elements like bottom sheets and landscape layouts, and improves code organization. The `ContextMenuLayer` now uses this helper for long-press events.
