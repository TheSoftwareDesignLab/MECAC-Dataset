feat: Introduce ETA widget markers and update existing icons

Adds new widget icons for Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) in day and night modes,
along with a supporting triangle variant.
Also refines the existing widget_marker_day, widget_marker_night,
and widget_marker_triangle icons by updating path data and removing redundant paths.
