feat: Rework position animation with dedicated settings

Introduces a new "Position animation" settings screen for more granular control.
- Users can enable/disable animation via a toolbar switch.
- When enabled, an advanced card with a slider allows adjusting "Prediction time" (formerly "Location interpolation percent").
- When disabled, an empty state banner is displayed.
- The preference in General settings now navigates to this screen and shows a summary of the animation status and prediction time.
- "Prediction time" is now profile-dependent and defaults to 0 when animation is off.
