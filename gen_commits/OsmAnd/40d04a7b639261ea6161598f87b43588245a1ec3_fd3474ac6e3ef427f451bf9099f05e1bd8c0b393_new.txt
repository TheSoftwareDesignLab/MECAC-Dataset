refactor: Streamline 'Continue Navigation' logic in Android Auto

Simplified the conditions for displaying and handling the 'Continue Navigation' item in LandingScreen to solely rely on `routingHelper.isRouteCalculated`. Replaced `mapActionsHelper.startNavigation()` with `routingHelper.resumeNavigation()` for continuing an already calculated route.
