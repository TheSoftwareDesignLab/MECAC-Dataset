fix: Restore application mode during route following

Previously, the application mode was only reset to default when 'Follow the route' was off.
This change ensures that if 'Follow the route' is enabled on startup, the last saved application mode is restored, providing the correct context for navigation. If 'Follow the route' is off, the application mode is reset to the default.
