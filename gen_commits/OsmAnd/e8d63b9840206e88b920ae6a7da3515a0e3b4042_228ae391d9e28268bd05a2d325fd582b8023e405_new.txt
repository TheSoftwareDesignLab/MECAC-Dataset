feat: Add framework for Glide Ratio map widgets

This commit introduces the necessary components to support 'Glide Ratio'
map widgets. It includes new string resources, defines new WidgetType
and WidgetGroup enums, registers the widgets for availability, and
creates a skeletal GlideWidget class.

The actual implementation for calculating and displaying glide ratio
values is marked as a future task.
