feat: Improve GPX track routing mode and parameter handling

- Automatically infer ApplicationMode from GPX route points when entering route planning.
- Hide OsmAnd-specific routing parameters when following a GPX track that doesn't
  require internal route calculation, ensuring only relevant options are shown.
- Refactor GPX track condition check into a dedicated helper method for clarity.
- Add null safety check for RouteMenuAppModes in the UI to prevent crashes.
