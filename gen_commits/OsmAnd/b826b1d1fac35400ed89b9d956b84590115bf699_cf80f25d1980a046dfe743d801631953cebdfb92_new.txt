fix(ui): Prevent accidental swipe dismiss during vertical scroll

Introduces a mechanism to cancel a potential swipe-to-dismiss gesture if
significant vertical movement is detected before the horizontal swipe
is confirmed. This prevents items from being accidentally dismissed when
the user intends to scroll the list vertically.

Removes redundant enabling/disabling of the swipe listener during
dashboard item reordering, as the improved gesture detection in the
listener makes these explicit controls unnecessary.
