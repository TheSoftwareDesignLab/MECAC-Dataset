feat: Add stop online monitoring button to active trip recording

Introduce a new "Stop Online Monitoring" button to the active trip recording bottom sheet, allowing users to easily disable live tracking.

This commit also includes UI standardizations and refactorings:
- Set a minimum height for bottom sheet buttons.
- Standardized letter spacing for button text across bottom sheets.
- Ensured consistent divider spacing in relevant bottom sheet fragments.
- Refactored track appearance update logic and ensured the track icon is refreshed when returning from the track appearance fragment.
