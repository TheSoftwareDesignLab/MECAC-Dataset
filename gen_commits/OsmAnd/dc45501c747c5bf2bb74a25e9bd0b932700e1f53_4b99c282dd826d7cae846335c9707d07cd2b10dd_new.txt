feat: Enhance export/import UI and navigation

Refactor back button and data selection logic to BaseSettingsListFragment for improved consistency across export/import flows.
Relocate 'Search History' from 'Settings' to 'My Places' category for export/import, aligning with data type.
Introduce detailed item descriptions, including counts, sizes, and map types, in export/import bottom sheets and lists.
Apply various layout adjustments (paddings, margins, min-heights) for visual consistency.
Improve 'Continue' button interaction by adding scroll-to-top behavior.
