feat: Display live distance, direction, and address for waypoints

Introduces real-time distance, direction, and geocoded address information for waypoints within the track points list.
This enhancement includes:
- Dynamic updates for distance and direction based on user's current location and heading.
- Asynchronous geocoding to resolve and display waypoint addresses.
- UI updates optimized to prevent refreshes during scrolling.
- Refactors `wpt_list_item.xml` by removing unused elements and standardizing styles.
