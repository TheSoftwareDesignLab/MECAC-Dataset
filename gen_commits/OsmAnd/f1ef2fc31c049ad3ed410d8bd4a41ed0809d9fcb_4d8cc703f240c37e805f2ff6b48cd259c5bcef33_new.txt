fix: Update display density factor calculation

Switches the display density factor calculation from `densityDpi / 160.0f`
to `displayMetrics.density` for a more standard and consistent scaling.
Includes an additional scaling adjustment for large screen devices in
`NativeQtLibrary` to improve UI presentation.
Also removes an unused `FrameLayout` import.
