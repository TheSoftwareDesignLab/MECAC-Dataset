fix(ui): RTL support for Explore Places fragment and toolbar

This commit introduces comprehensive RTL (Right-to-Left) layout support for the
Explore Places fragment when displayed in landscape mode, and refactors the
TopToolbarView's adjustment logic to properly interact with it.

Changes include:
- Modified ExplorePlacesFragment to calculate its horizontal translation (slide-in/out)
  based on the current layout direction (RTL or LTR).
- Updated the isLandScapeVisible() check to correctly determine fragment visibility
  considering RTL translation values.
- Refactored TopToolbarView.adjustForOverlay() to accommodate the overlapping
  Explore Places fragment correctly in RTL layouts, adjusting its width and
  using gravity instead of direct X-position manipulation.
- Introduced TopToolbarView.setupAnimationParams() to set the toolbar's gravity
  to ensure proper alignment during animations in landscape mode.
