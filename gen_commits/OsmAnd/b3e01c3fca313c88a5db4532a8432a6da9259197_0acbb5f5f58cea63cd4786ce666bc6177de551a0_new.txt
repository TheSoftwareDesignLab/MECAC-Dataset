feat: Support GZIP compressed POI text values

Introduces GZIP decompression for string values from binary POI data
that are prefixed with ' gz '. This allows for more efficient storage of
larger text attributes (e.g., descriptions, opening hours) in maps.

Also refactors MapRenderingTypes by renaming `parseTypeFromXML` to
`parseAndRegisterTypeFromXML`, adding an overloaded `parseBaseRuleType`
for explicit tag passing, and introducing a `lang` field to MapRulType.
