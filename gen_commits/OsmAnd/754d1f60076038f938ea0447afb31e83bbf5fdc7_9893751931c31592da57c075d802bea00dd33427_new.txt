feat: Add native search for rendered map objects

Introduces a new native method and Java API to search for map objects at
a given screen coordinate that have been rendered.
The `RenderedObject` class is added to encapsulate the details of these
found objects, including their tags, bounding box, and location.

- Delete `FloatMath` class, simplifying float math operations.
- Add `toString()` method to `QuadRect` for better debugging.
