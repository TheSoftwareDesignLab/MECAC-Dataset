refactor: Decouple input device caching by app mode

- Introduced `DefaultInputDevices` to centralize predefined profiles.
- Created `InputDevicesCollection` for application mode-specific device management.
- Refactored `InputDeviceHelper` to manage separate device collections for functionality and customization via `cacheId`.
- Updated `KeyEventHelper` to reload the functionality cache on relevant device events.
- Migrated related fragments to use the new cached collection approach.
- Replaced `InputDevicesEventCallback` with `InputDevicesEventListener` for mode-aware events.
