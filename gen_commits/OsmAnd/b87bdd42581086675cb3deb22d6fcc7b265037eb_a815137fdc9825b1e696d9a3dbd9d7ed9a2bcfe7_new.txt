refactor: Unify 'traffic warnings' terminology in UI

Renames `way_alarms` from 'Obstacles' to 'Traffic warnings' in English.
Updates German translations for `speak_traffic_warnings` and `way_alarms`
to consistently use 'Verkehrswarnungen' (traffic warnings) instead of
'Verkehrsmeldungen' (traffic messages) and 'Hindernisse' (obstacles).
This improves clarity and consistency across languages.
