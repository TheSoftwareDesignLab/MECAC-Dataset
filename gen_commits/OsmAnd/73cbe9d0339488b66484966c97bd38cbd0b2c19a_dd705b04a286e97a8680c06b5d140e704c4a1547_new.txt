feat: Revamp GPX track details UI with tabbed info and charts

Introduces a new tabbed interface for displaying detailed GPX track information.
Key changes include:
- Replaced the single GPX list item with a tabbed view for segments.
- Segments now feature 'General', 'Altitude', and 'Speed' tabs, each with dedicated charts and statistics.
- Refactored GPX chart utilities (`GPXUtilities`) to support separate elevation and speed datasets and configurable chart axis.
- Merged 'Route Points' functionality into 'Track Points' fragment, consolidating all points into a single tab.
- Added new layouts (`gpx_item_general`, `gpx_item_altitude`, `gpx_item_speed`, `gpx_list_item_tab_content`, `gpx_tab`) and string resources.
- Introduced `WrapContentHeightViewPager` for dynamic height adjustment of tab content.
- Enhanced `PagerSlidingTabStrip` with configurable inactive text color and custom tab selection callbacks.
- Improved chart interaction by preventing list view touch interception.
