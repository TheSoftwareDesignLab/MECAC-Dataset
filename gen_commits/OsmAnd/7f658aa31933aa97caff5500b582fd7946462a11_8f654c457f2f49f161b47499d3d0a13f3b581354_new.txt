feat: Enhance QuickSearch accessibility and navigation feedback

Integrate AccessibilityAssistant and NavigationInfo to provide improved spoken feedback and direction updates within the quick search.

- Compass updates are temporarily redirected to QuickSearch when active, then restored.
- Accessibility events are locked during UI updates to ensure controlled announcements.
- NavigationInfo updates location and target direction for focused search items.
