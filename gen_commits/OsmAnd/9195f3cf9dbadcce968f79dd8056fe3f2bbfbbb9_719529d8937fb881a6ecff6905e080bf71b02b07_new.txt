refactor: Remove MapExplorer and simplify gesture handling

The MapExplorer class, which provided a touch exploration mode and acted as a
wrapper for GestureDetector, has been removed.
Its specific gesture handling logic, such as reducing fling velocity by 1/3,
is now directly integrated into MapTileViewOnGestureListener.
This change streamlines the map's gesture detection architecture.
