feat: Improve Wikivoyage image download dialog and tag handling

Refactor Amenity tag content retrieval to introduce `getStrictTagContent` for precise language-specific lookups. Modify `getTagContent` to first use the strict lookup, then fallback to broader tag matching.
Simplify Wikivoyage image download dialog options to "Only with WiFi" and "Always", removing the "OFF" option and conditional UI based on network state.
Apply `getStrictTagContent` for `IS_AGGR_PART` in `TravelObfHelper` to ensure accurate aggregation part resolution.
