refactor: Introduce alternative button overlap resolution

Adds an `ALTERNATIVE_ALGORITHM` flag to switch between two button layout strategies.
The original algorithm iterates backwards, moving subsequent overlapping buttons.
The new alternative algorithm iterates forwards, moving the current button away from previously placed buttons.
The `moveButton` function now explicitly returns whether a button was moved.
Expanded `testLayout1` to include more vertically stacked buttons for better validation.
