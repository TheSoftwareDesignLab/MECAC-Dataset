refactor: Extract file name translation to dedicated helper

Moved file name translation logic, including voice and map name resolution,
from OsmandSettings and LocalIndexesActivity into a new
FileNameTranslationHelper class. This centralizes the logic and improves
code organization. Call sites updated accordingly.
