feat: Delegate single double-tap to scale detector listener

The `DoubleTapScaleDetector` now explicitly detects and dispatches single double-tap gestures via a new `onDoubleTap` callback in its `DoubleTapZoomListener`.

This change clarifies the responsibility of gesture handling, ensuring the `DoubleTapScaleDetector` manages both:
- Standard double-tap for zooming in.
- Double-tap and hold for continuous scaling.

Previously, the standard double-tap was handled by a separate `GestureDetector`. This consolidates related double-tap logic within a single detector. Refactored squared distance calculation into a helper method for clarity.
