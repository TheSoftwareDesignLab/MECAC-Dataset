feat: Implement smart backspace and refine search result display

The quick search bar's clear button now removes the last word from the input
instead of clearing the entire phrase, acting as a smart backspace.

Additionally, search result item names for cities, villages, and streets
have been improved for clarity. This includes:
- Using specific localized strings for city types (e.g., "District", "Neighbourhood").
- Reformatting distance information for related objects using "from" text.
