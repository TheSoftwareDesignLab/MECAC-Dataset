feat: Support custom download regions under "Extra maps"

Refactor `DownloadDataContainer` into `CustomRegion`, which now extends `WorldRegion`. This allows plugins to define custom map regions and their downloadable items. These custom regions are presented in the download manager under a new "Extra maps" group, integrating them into the existing regional download hierarchy.
