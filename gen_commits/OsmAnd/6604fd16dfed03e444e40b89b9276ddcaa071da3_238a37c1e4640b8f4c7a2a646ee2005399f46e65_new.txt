feat: Redesign existing widget icons and add new sensor ones

Updated `average_speed`, `max_speed`, and `speed` widget icons for both day and night themes with a new visual style and gradients.
Introduced a comprehensive set of new widget icons for various sensors: `bicycle_power`, `cadence`, `external`, `heart_rate`, `speed`, and `distance` (including day/night variations).
This improves visual consistency and expands the available widget options.
