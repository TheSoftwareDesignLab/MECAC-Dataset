fix: Enhance bearing calculation and validation

Improve bearing calculation logic in RoutingHelper and RouteLayer by
using the current location's bearing when previous and current route
points are identical. Normalize all calculated bearings to a 0-360
degree range.

In PointLocationLayer, ensure that the location's bearing is only set
if the location object itself indicates it has a valid bearing.
