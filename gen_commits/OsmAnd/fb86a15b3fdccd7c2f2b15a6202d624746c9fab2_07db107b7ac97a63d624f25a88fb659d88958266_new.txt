refactor: Unify app mode icon loading and refine profile UI

This commit refactors application mode icon management by storing icon names as strings and using a helper to resolve resource IDs. This ensures more flexible and consistent icon handling across the app.

Profile UI enhancements include:
- Moving the "Manage Profiles" button into the `ProfileMenuAdapter` as a special item within profile selection bottom sheets.
- Adding IDs to dividers and menu images for better programmatic control.
- Excluding the "geocoding" profile from the routing profiles list.
- Hiding the bottom divider for the last item in specific profile bottom sheets.

Additionally, the 'router_service' preference has been removed from navigation settings, and a routing promo string has been externalized for localization.
