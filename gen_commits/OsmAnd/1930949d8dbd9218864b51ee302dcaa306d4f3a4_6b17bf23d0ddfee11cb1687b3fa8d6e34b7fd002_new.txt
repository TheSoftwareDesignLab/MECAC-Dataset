refactor: Standardize language display and update status

Standardized the display of "Norwegian Bokmål" by adding parentheses around "Bokmål" and "Buchsprache" in English and German string resources.
Removed the 'incomplete' suffix for the Belarusian (Belarus) language, indicating its translation is now complete.
