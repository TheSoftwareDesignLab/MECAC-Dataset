i18n(sl): Add string resources for OsmAnd Tracker UI

This commit introduces new string resources for the Slovenian localization.
It includes translations for various UI elements and descriptions, such as
"Location history", "Open OsmAnd", welcome messages, and timeline-related texts.
A minor whitespace correction was also applied to the "start_end_date" string.
