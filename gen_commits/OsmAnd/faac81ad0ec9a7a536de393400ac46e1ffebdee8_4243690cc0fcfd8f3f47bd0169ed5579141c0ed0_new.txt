refactor(auto): Rename "Free mode" to "Free ride"

Updates the "Free mode" string to "Free ride" across various languages
and adjusts its icon in the Android Auto Landing Screen.

Also, ensures the back button is always visible in the Action Strip
when not navigating and adds `invalidate()` for immediate compass
icon updates on click.
