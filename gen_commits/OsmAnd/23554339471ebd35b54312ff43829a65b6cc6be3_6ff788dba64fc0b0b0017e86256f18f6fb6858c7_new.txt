refactor: Modularize map controls; increase tile timeout

The `MapControlsLayer` has been refactored to delegate the management and rendering of zoom and menu buttons to new, dedicated classes: `MapZoomControls` and `MapMenuControls`. The magnifier dialog logic has been extracted into `MapMagnifier`. This significantly improves modularity, readability, and maintainability of the map controls.

Increased the connection timeout for map tile downloads from 10 seconds to 30 seconds. This enhancement improves reliability, particularly on slower or less stable network connections.

Removed an unused import for `OsmandSettings.AutoZoomMap` from `MapActivity`.
