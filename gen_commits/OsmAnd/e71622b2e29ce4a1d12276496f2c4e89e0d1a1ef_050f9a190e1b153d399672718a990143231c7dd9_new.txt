feat(markers): Add landscape layout for direction dialog

Introduces a dedicated landscape layout for the direction indication settings
dialog.

This change includes:
- A new `fragment_direction_indication_dialog.xml` in `layout-land` for a better landscape experience.
- New dimension resources for landscape-specific image sizing in `sizes.xml`.
- Conditional disabling of the app bar shadow visibility on scroll in
  `DirectionIndicationDialogFragment` when in landscape mode.
