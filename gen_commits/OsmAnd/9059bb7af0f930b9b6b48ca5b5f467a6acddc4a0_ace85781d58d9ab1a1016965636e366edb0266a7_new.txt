feat: Control display of next turn info in street name widgets

Refactor `CurrentStreetName` to introduce a `showNextTurn` parameter, allowing widgets to explicitly control whether turn-related information (like turn type and road shields) is displayed.

The main `StreetNameWidget` now uses the `SHOW_NEXT_TURN_INFO` setting. `NextTurnWidget` and `SecondNextTurnWidget` always show turn details. Extracted helper methods for better readability and maintainability in `CurrentStreetName`.
