fix: Improve touch event handling and cancellation

In `MultiTouchSupport`, ensure `ACTION_UP` is consumed after a zoom/rotation gesture ends to prevent unintended propagation.
In `OsmandMapTileView`, explicitly dispatch `ACTION_CANCEL` to all layers and the gesture detector when touch events are disabled to stop ongoing gestures cleanly.
