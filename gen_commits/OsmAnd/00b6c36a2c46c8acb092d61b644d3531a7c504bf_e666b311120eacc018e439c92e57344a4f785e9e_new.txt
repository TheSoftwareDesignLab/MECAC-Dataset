refactor(inapp): Modularize and enhance purchase cards UI

Replaced old subscription cards with new InAppPurchaseCard and PromoPurchaseCard. This refactors the display of in-app purchases and subscriptions for a more unified and modular approach.

- Introduced `inapp_purchase_card.xml` and corresponding `InAppPurchaseCard.java` for displaying individual purchases/subscriptions.
- Added `PromoPurchaseCard.java` to handle the display of promo subscriptions, including start and expiration dates.
- Updated `InAppPurchaseHelper` and `OsmandSettings` to store detailed promo subscription states (start time, expire time, and state).
- Enhanced subscription status display with new strings for "active till" and "on hold since".
- Removed deprecated `SubscriptionsCard.java`, `SubscriptionsListCard.java`, and their associated layouts.
