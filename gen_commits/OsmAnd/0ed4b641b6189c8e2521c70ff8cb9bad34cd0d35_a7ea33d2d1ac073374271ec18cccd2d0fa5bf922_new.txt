refactor: Introduce setters for map touch detectors

Refactor `OsmandMapTileView` to use dedicated setter methods for touch
detectors (GestureDetector, MultiTouchSupport, DoubleTapScaleDetector,
and TwoFingerTapDetector).

This change improves flexibility by allowing external injection of
these components, which can aid testability. The `setupTouchDetectors`
and `clearTouchDetectors` methods now utilize these new setters.

Also removed unused imports `Pair` and `Locale`.
