feat: Enhance road rendering with shadows and earlier shields

- Display highway reference shields (motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, tertiary)
  at lower zoom levels for improved visibility.
- Added a subtle shadowRadius to major road types (motorway, primary, secondary,
  tertiary) for better visual separation.
- Adjusted stroke width for secondary and tertiary roads at lower zoom levels.
- Build: Added -fPIC flag for i386 architecture for shared library compatibility.
- Build: Removed unused linker flag `-Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions` for Linux.
