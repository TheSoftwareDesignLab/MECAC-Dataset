fix: Use float zoom for precise step changes

Update zoom button logic to use `view.getFloatZoom()` instead of `view.getZoom()`.
This change ensures that zoom operations respect fractional zoom levels, providing more granular and accurate zoom steps when interacting with map controls.
The `ZOOM_DELTA` constant is also explicitly set to `1`.
