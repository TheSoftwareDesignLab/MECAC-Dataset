feat(widgets): Redesign configure widgets screen

Introduced a revamped UI for the configure widgets screen, featuring a collapsing toolbar, floating action button for adding widgets, and persistent bottom action buttons.
Added a dedicated "Edit Mode" to streamline widget reordering and removal.
Implemented a new search screen for easily discovering and adding widgets.
Refactored internal logic using `ConfigureWidgetsController` for better modularity and enhanced widget management options (copy from profile, reset to default).
