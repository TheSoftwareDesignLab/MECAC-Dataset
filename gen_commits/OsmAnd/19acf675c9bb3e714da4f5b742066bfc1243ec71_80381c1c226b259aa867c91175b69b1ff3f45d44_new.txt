feat: Show detailed GPX track statistics in context menu

Adds a specialized `SelectedGpxMenuBuilder` to display comprehensive analysis for selected GPX tracks directly in the map context menu.

The new menu includes sections for:
- Overview (distance, time span, start/end time)
- Elevation (average, min/max, ascent/descent)
- Speed (average, max, distance moving)

A custom address line also provides a quick summary of distance, waypoints, and time span.
Introduces `getThemedIcon` in `MenuBuilder` for simplified themed icon retrieval.
