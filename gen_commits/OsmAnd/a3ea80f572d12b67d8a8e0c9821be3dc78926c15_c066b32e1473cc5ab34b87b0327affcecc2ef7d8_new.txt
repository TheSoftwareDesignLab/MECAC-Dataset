refactor: Elevate app bar and refine mode-specific preferences

Add elevation to AppBarLayout in BaseSettingsFragment for improved UI.
Refactor navigation settings visibility in ConfigureProfileFragment using
`isDerivedRoutingFrom` for better mode-specific logic. Optimize
CoordinatesFormatFragment to only update preferences if the format
has truly changed for the selected application mode.
