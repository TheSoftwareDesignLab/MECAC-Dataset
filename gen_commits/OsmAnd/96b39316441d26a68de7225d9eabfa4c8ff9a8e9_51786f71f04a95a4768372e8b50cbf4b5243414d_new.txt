refactor: Consolidate 'my location' context menu logic

Extracted latitude/longitude to screen point conversion into a new private helper method `getPointFromLatLon` within `ContextMenuLayer`.
Introduced a dedicated public method `showContextMenuForMyLocation` in `ContextMenuLayer` to encapsulate the process of locating the user's position and displaying its context menu.
Updated `MapControlsLayer` to utilize this new `ContextMenuLayer` method, simplifying its implementation and improving responsibility separation.
