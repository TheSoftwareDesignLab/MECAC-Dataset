refactor(ui): Revamp main menu layouts and drawables

Update button nine-patch drawables for a refreshed look.
Refactor `menu.xml` layouts across various screen sizes and orientations.
Transitioned button sizing from fixed `dp` width to flexible `layout_weight`.
Adjusted button heights, margins, and content positioning for improved consistency.
Removed dedicated `layout-small-land` and `layout-small` menu files.
Fix typo `mapIndent` to `mapIntent` in `MainMenuActivity.java`.
