refactor: Move accessibility classes to plugin package

Relocates all accessibility-related classes from `net.osmand.access`
and `net.osmand.plus.access` to `net.osmand.plus.plugins.accessibility`.
This improves code organization by placing plugin-specific components
within their dedicated plugin package structure.
