refactor: Adjust My Location tab app bar padding and layout

Adjusted the app bar layout and padding for the My Location tab.
- Reduced the main image height.
- Decreased the bottom margin of the text container.
- Made the title container height dynamic (`wrap_content`).
- Implemented dynamic top/bottom padding for the title based on the app bar's collapse state.
- Conditionally applies/removes status bar padding to the text container during app bar collapse/expand transitions.
