refactor(android-auto): Improve map fitting and orientation

Refactored OsmandMapTileView.fitRectToMap to standardize map region fitting.
This includes:
- Forcing a top-down, north-up view (elevation 90, rotate 0) for map
  adjustments within Android Auto screens.
- Removing custom calculations for map rect coefficients in
  BaseAndroidAutoScreen, now relying on the refactored fitRectToMap.
- Changing the internal border for map fitting from 0.8 to 0.9.
- Adding debug logging for map fitting in RoutePreviewScreen and
  OsmandMapTileView.
