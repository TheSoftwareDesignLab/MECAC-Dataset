style: Adjust drawer UI: item spacing, text sizes, sub-header height

- Replaced `layout_marginLeft` with `paddingLeft` in drawer list items for consistent spacing.
- Set explicit `textSize` for title (18sp) and description (14sp) for improved readability.
- Increased sub-header `layout_height` to 40dp for better visual presentation.
