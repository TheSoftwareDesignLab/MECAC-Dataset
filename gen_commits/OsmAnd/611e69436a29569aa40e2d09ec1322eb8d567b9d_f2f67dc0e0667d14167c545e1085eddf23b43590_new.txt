feat: Introduce dedicated switch for off-route recalculation

Previously, off-route recalculation was implicitly disabled when its distance value was 0.
This change introduces a dedicated `DISABLE_OFFROUTE_RECALC` boolean preference to explicitly enable or disable the feature. The `ROUTE_RECALCULATION_DISTANCE` preference now exclusively manages the actual deviation distance when the feature is active.

Updates include:
- `OsmAndPreferencesDataStore` now correctly handles the inverted boolean logic for the `DISABLE_OFFROUTE_RECALC` preference.
- `RouteParametersFragment` creates and displays the new switch, linking it to the `RecalculateRouteInDeviationBottomSheet` for distance configuration.
- `RecalculateRouteInDeviationBottomSheet` adapts to work with the new switch's state and updates the distance preference.
