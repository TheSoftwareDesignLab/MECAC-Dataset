feat(dashboard): Add swipe-to-dismiss for cards

- Upgrade Android Support Library `appcompat-v7` to `22.2.1`.
- Add Android Design Support Library `22.2.1`.
- Refactor dashboard fragments:
    - Introduce `initView` in `DashBaseFragment` for view creation, making `onCreateView` final.
    - Implement swipe-to-dismiss functionality using `SwipeDismissTouchListener`.
    - Display a `Snackbar` with an "UNDO" option upon card dismissal.
- Update `SettingsGeneralActivity` and other fragments to reflect `initView` changes.
