feat: Improve custom routing profile name display

Previously, descriptions for custom routing profiles relied directly on the internal profile key. This change fetches the profile's display name from its associated RoutingProfileDataObject for more accurate presentation. The logic has been extracted into a new `getCustomProfileDescription` helper method for better reusability and maintainability.
