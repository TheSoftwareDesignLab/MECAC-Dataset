feat(auto): Auto-start navigation and refine screen management

Automatically starts navigation on resume in Android Auto if a route is calculated and following mode is active.

- Prevents pushing the NavigationScreen if it's already the top screen.
- Refactors `showRoutePreview` to consistently use `RoutingHelper.isFollowingMode()`.
- Removes redundant screen push logic from `LandingScreen`.
