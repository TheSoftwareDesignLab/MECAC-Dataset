refactor: Migrate map marker item layout to LinearLayout

Refactored `map_marker_item_new.xml` to use a horizontal LinearLayout for the main content. This simplifies the layout structure by leveraging `layout_gravity` and `layout_weight` over complex `RelativeLayout` attributes.

The bottom divider view was moved directly into the parent FrameLayout with `layout_gravity="bottom"`.
Additionally, the description text (`map_marker_desc_text`) now truncates with ellipses if it exceeds a single line.
