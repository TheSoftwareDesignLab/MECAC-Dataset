feat: Add goods delivery restrictions routing option

Introduces a new routing parameter `goods_restrictions` and its corresponding UI.
This allows users to specify whether their light goods vehicle (under 3.5 tonnes) should avoid roads closed for goods delivery. A new bottom sheet preference is added to configure this setting.
