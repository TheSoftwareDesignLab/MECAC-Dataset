feat: Implement top-indexed POI additional search and filter

- Introduce a new mechanism to search and filter Points of Interest (POIs) based on specific additional tags (e.g., 'brand', 'operator') that are pre-indexed.
- Add `SearchPoiAdditionalFilter` interface and integrate it into `BinaryMapIndexReader`'s search request.
- Enhance POI data structures (`PoiRegion`, `PoiType`) to identify and store top-indexed subtypes.
- Update `SearchCoreFactory` to discover, cache, and display these additional filters in search results.
- Refactor UI components (`AmenityMenuController`, `QuickSearchListItem`) to handle new filter types and improve POI subtype display with translations.
