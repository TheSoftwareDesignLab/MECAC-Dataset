feat: Enhance route options toolbar for better management

Active route parameters (avoided roads, POI filters, traffic warnings, favorites) are now displayed as individual, removable buttons in the route info toolbar. Users can directly remove or toggle these options from the toolbar.

Refactored option button layouts to use fixed widths and dynamic height, with new sub-option views for improved display and interaction. Added rounded corners to gradient backgrounds for a softer UI appearance. Moved route parameter group dialog logic to `RoutingOptionsHelper`.
