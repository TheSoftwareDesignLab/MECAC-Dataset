feat: Separate ruler into radius ruler and ruler by tap

The existing map ruler functionality has been refactored into two distinct features:

- Radius Ruler: The original compass-like circles and distance measurement from the map center are now handled by the new `RadiusRulerControlLayer`.
- Ruler by Tap: A new feature for measuring distance between two finger taps or between a tapped point and the current location, handled by the new `RulerByTapControlLayer`.

This separation improves code clarity and allows independent control over each ruler type.
