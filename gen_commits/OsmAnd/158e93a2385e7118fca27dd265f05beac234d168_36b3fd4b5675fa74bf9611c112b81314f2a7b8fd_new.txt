refactor: Centralize zoom button logic in MapControlsLayer

Move the creation, styling, and event handling for map zoom buttons
from `ChooseRouteFragment` and `TrackAppearanceFragment` to `MapControlsLayer`.
This eliminates duplicated `doZoomIn` and `doZoomOut` methods in fragments
and ensures consistent behavior and lifecycle management.
Removes unused quick action widget XML layout.
