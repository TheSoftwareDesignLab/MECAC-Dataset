feat: Introduce custom map ratio for accurate zoom centering

This change implements a custom map ratio mechanism to enhance map centering,
especially during zoom operations initiated from the Map Context Menu.

- New methods `setCustomMapRatio`, `restoreMapRatio`, and `hasCustomMapRatio`
  are added to `OsmandMapTileView`. These allow for defining and managing
  a temporary, fixed screen-coordinate ratio for the map's center.
- The map's rendering logic now prioritizes these custom ratios over
  default `mapPosition` settings when active.
- `MapContextMenuFragment`'s `doZoomIn` and `doZoomOut` methods are updated
  to utilize this new ratio, ensuring the selected point's screen position
  is maintained relative to the map's viewport during zoom.
- The custom ratio is automatically restored to default when the context menu's
  state changes or the fragment is paused, ensuring normal map behavior
  outside the menu.
- This simplifies the zoom logic in the context menu by removing the redundant
  `centered` flag and its associated `calculateCenterLatLon` calls.
