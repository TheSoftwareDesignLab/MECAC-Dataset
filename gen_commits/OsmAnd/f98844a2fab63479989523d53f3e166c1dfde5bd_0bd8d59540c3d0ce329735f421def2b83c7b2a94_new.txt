refactor: Enhance main menu button layout and assets

Increased button heights for Map, Search, Favorites, and Settings buttons.
Adjusted vertical margins between table rows for improved spacing.
Updated 9-patch drawable backgrounds (`bg_leftr`, `bg_rightr`) to support the new dimensions and ensure correct rendering across different densities.
