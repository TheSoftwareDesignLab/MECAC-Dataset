refactor: Clarify GPS sleep mode UI strings

Renamed "Sleep mode" to "GPS sleep mode" in English and German for better clarity, ensuring users understand it specifically pertains to GPS.
Updated the "Stop sleep mode" dialog prompt to be more direct and consistent with stopping the GPS sleep mode functionality.
