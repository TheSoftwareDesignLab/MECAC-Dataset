refactor: Set context menu button text color dynamically

Moves context menu controller button text color application from theme attributes in XML to programmatic setting in Java.
This ensures the correct ColorStateList is applied based on night mode.
Also, renames color XML files from `drawable` to `color` for semantic correctness.
