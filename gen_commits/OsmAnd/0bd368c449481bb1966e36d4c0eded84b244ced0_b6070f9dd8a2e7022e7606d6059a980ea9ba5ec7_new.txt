fix: Temporarily disable scrollbar during dashboard animation

Disables the ListView's vertical scrollbar at the start of the dashboard
animation and re-enables it upon completion. This prevents potential
visual flickering or jarring transitions of the scrollbar during the
animation, leading to a smoother user experience.
