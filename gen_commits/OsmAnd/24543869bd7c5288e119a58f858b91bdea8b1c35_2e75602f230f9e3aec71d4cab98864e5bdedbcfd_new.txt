fix: Improve contrast for route direction arrows

Refactors route segment data handling and caching in `GeometryWay` and
`RouteGeometryWay` to enable accurate background color lookup for action
points. This ensures better visibility of direction arrows on the map.
Action point indexing is adjusted for multi-route scenarios.
