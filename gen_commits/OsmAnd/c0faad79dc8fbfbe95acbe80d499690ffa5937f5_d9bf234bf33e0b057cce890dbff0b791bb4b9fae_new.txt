fix: Refine privacy policy and welcome strings

Improve grammar, clarity, and phrasing in user-facing text.
Specifically:
- Rephrased `privacy_policy_telegram_client` for better clarity.
- Updated `privacy_policy_agree` to specify "conditions of" agreement.
- Enhanced `welcome_descr` for better flow and grammatical correctness.
