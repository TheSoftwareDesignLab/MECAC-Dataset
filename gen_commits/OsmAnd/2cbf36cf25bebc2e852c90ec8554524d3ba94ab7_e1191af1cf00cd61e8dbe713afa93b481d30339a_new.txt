refactor: Simplify two-finger tap detector

- Removed MotionEvent parameters from SimpleTwoFingerTapDetector.onTwoFingerTap callback.
- The two-finger tap gesture now triggers a direct zoom out, without re-centering the map on the tap point.
- Implemented a compatibility workaround for MotionEvent.getActionMasked() to support older Android versions (2.2).
