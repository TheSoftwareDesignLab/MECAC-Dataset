feat: Add weather plugin settings screen

Introduces a dedicated settings screen for the weather plugin, accessible via
`R.xml.weather`. This screen allows users to configure:
- Measurement units for temperature, pressure, wind, clouds, and precipitation.
- Offline forecast and online cache settings, including display of storage size.

This change also includes:
- Refactoring the `OnPreferenceChanged` interface to a default method, reducing
  boilerplate in various settings fragments.
- Enhancing plugin descriptions in `PluginInfoFragment` to automatically
  recognize and link URLs.
