refactor: Programmatically create route info controls and cleanup routing

Removed experimental Avian-related native routing implementations.
Moved route navigation controls (previous, next, info buttons) from XML layouts to programmatic creation in `RouteInfoLayer`.
Improved route direction descriptions to include formatted street names.
Refined route cancellation options in the map context menu with new string resources.
Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` with additional `uses-feature` and `supports-screens` declarations.
Cleaned up unused code and comments in `PlatformUtil`, `NativeLibrary`, `SettingsActivity`, and `ShowRouteInfoActivity`.
Added null check for street reference in `RoutingHelper.formatStreetName`.
Adjusted navigation arrow color in `TurnPathHelper`.
