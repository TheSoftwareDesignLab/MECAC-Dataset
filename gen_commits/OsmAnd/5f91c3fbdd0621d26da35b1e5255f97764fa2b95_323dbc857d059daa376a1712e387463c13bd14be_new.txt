fix: Improve display of route directions and street names

Introduce `getDescriptionRoutePart(boolean forceTurnType)` to provide a fallback to the turn type when the route description is empty.
Update `RouteDirectionsCard`, `NextTurnWidget`, and `SecondNextTurnWidget` to utilize this for better user feedback, ensuring a turn type is always displayed if a detailed description is missing.
Adjust `RoutingHelperUtils.formatStreetName` to prevent displaying " towards Destination" when the 'towards' information is empty.
Add `requestLayout()` calls in `OutlinedTextContainer` after setting text for proper rendering.
