refactor(map-widgets): Remove widget collapse/expand functionality

Previously, map widgets could be collapsed or expanded via a dedicated button. This functionality has been removed to simplify the map UI and reduce code complexity.

This commit includes:
- Removal of the 'collapse' button from map HUD layouts.
- Deletion of `wasCollapseButtonVisible` flags and related logic across various fragments and map layers.
- Refactoring of `MapWidgetInfo` and `MapWidgetRegistry` APIs, eliminating the concept of 'collapsible' widgets and simplifying visibility management to a binary 'visible' or 'hidden' state.
- Updates to all call sites for widget visibility management and context menus.
- Minor layout cleanup for widget panels.
