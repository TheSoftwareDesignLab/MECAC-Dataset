feat: Introduce overlay menu for map activity

Refactor MainMenuActivity initialization into a static method to allow
its menu layout to be reused within a translucent, fullscreen dialog.
This dialog now serves as an overlay menu when accessed from the map,
providing a more seamless user experience.

Adds `color_transparent` and `Dialog_Fullscreen` style.
Introduces `APP_EXIT_CODE` for graceful app termination via activity result.
