feat: Implement in-app help article viewer

Introduce a new `HelpArticleDialogFragment` to display detailed HTML help articles directly within the app using a WebView.
HTML article files from `help/website/feature_articles` are now included in the app's assets.
The "Online Maps" plugin item on the help screen has been updated to open its corresponding feature article.
Includes minor toolbar styling adjustments and uses themed `getDrawable` for backgrounds.
