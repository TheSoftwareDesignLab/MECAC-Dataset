feat: Implement comprehensive RTL layout support

This commit introduces Right-to-Left (RTL) layout support across the application.
Key changes include:
- Added `android:supportsRtl="true"` to the application manifest.
- Migrated layout attributes from `layout_marginLeft`/`layout_marginRight` to `layout_marginStart`/`layout_marginEnd` in relevant layouts.
- Implemented `UiUtilities.setupLayoutDirection` to programmatically set view layout direction based on locale.
- Utilized `setCompoundDrawablesRelative` for TextViews on API 17+ to ensure compound drawables correctly align in RTL contexts.
