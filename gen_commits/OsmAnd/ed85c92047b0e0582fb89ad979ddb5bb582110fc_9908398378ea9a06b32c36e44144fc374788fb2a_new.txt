feat: Add multi-touch gesture for 3D map tilt

Introduces a two-finger vertical drag gesture to control the map's elevation
angle (3D view tilt). The map can now be tilted between 35 and 90 degrees.
This includes new gesture detection logic, a callback for angle changes,
and updates to the OpenGL renderer. Prevents standard map scrolling
from interfering with the tilt gesture. Also refines multi-touch rotation
detection during zoom.
