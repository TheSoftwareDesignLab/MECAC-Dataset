feat: Enhance snap track warning dialog with explicit options

Refactor `SnapTrackWarningFragment` to offer explicit actions for track approximation when editing.
The dialog now presents "Attach to the roads" and "Connect with straight line" options.
The "Attach to roads" action in `MeasurementToolFragment` now correctly checks if approximation is needed, showing a warning otherwise.
Ensure `FollowTrackFragment` closes after opening the `MeasurementToolFragment`.
