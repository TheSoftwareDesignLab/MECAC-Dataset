feat: Implement map position adjustment for context menu

Initializes the favorite action icon for the map context menu to a default value.
Adds a new `adjustMapPosition` method and related padding to automatically shift the map, ensuring the selected marker remains visible above the context menu when it appears.
The map adjustment logic is currently commented out (`//adjustMapPosition(y);`) and will be enabled later.
