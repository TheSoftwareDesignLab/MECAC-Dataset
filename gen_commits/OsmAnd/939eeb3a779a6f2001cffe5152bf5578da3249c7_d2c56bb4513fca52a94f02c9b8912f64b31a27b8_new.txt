feat: Add configurable text button to map top toolbar

Implement a generic TextViewEx button for the top toolbar. This button can be dynamically shown, configured with text and color, and assigned a click listener via the TopToolbarController.
Initial integration is in the DiscountHelper to display dynamic call-to-action buttons for promotions.
