feat: Granular backup progress and updated card layouts

Introduce granular progress tracking for backup and import operations.
Refactor backup status header and cloud change item layouts to use new card-style dividers and shadows.
Display "Checking..." status and indeterminate progress in the UI when a backup is being prepared, hiding the list of changes during this phase.
