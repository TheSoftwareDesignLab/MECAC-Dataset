refactor: Migrate help article storage and clean up code

- Help articles and index files now utilize `app.getCacheDir()` for storage.
- Removed `FileUtils` dependency and unused logging utilities.
- Added back button handling for `HelpArticlesFragment`.
- Improved UI with refined divider logic and new divider layouts.
- Included device info in "Contact Us" email intent for better support.
- Ensured help article categories are only created if not empty.
