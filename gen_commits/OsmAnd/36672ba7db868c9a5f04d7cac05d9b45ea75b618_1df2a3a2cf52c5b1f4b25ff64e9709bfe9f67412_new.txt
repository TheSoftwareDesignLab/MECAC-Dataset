feat: Scroll application mode buttons to active mode

The horizontal scroll view displaying application modes will now automatically
scroll to bring the currently active mode into view. This improves usability
by ensuring the selected mode is immediately visible when the dialog or menu
is opened, especially when many modes are available.
