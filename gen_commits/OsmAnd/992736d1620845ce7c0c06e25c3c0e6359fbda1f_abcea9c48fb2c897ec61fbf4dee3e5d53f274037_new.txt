feat: Add Sun position map widget

Introduces a new "Sun position" map widget that dynamically displays the time until the next sunrise or sunset event. The widget's display mode can be configured to show the next event, always sunset, or always sunrise. Existing Sunrise/Sunset widget logic and settings fragment were refactored to support this new combined widget type.
