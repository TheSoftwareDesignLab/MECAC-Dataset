feat: Improve auto-zoom based on distance to next turn

The auto-zoom algorithm now considers the distance to the next navigation instruction.
This enhancement utilizes a new `minDistanceToDrive` setting from `AutoZoomMap` to ensure upcoming turns are always visible without excessive zooming.
Animation durations have been refactored from `Long` to `Float` for increased precision.
