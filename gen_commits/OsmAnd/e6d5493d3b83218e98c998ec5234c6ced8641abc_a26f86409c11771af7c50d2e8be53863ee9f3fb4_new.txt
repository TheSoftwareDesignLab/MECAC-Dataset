fix: Improve tag editing and focus handling in POI dialog

- Unified tag item creation and focusing for new items.
- Smooth scroll to bottom and focus on new tags upon addition.
- Hide keyboard and clear focus when deleting off-screen tags.
- Refactored `currentTagEditText` and `clearFocus()` logic.
- Set ViewPager2 height to `match_parent` for correct sizing.
