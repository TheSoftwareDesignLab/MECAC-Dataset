feat: Update splash screen text for subscriptions and plugins

The splash screen text image now dynamically changes based on user entitlements.
It displays different logos for Live Updates subscribers and users with specific in-app purchases (e.g., depth contours) or enabled plugins (e.g., Parking, Ski, Nautical maps).
