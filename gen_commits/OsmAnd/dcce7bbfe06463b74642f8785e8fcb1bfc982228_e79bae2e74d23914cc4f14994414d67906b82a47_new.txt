refactor: Standardize filter retrieval and remove unused imports

Replaced `getFilter().toString()` with `getCurrentFilter()` for consistent filter access.
Removed several unused imports, including `BuildingInterpolation`, `ActionItem`, `QuickAction`, and `MapActivityActions`, cleaning up the codebase.
Added a check for non-empty filter string in `getText` method within `SearchBuildingByNameActivity`.
