fix(osmo): Improve group item display, selection toggle, and typo

- Corrected typo from "lcations" to "locations" in OsMo tracker string.
- Refactored `osmo_group_item.xml` to use an `ImageView` within a `RelativeLayout` for the settings icon, improving layout.
- Implemented toggle functionality: Clicking a group item's settings icon now enters selection mode or exits it if already selected.
- Ensured group list refreshes immediately after on/off actions or exiting selection mode.
- Fixed the condition for correctly displaying disabled group items.
