feat: Rework search dialog UI and add download group search

Extracted search input components into a reusable layout `search_text_layout.xml`.
Replaced `SearchView` in `SearchDialogFragment` with custom `EditText`, `ProgressBar`, and `ImageButton` for better control over the UI.
Implemented dynamic visibility for search progress and clear button.
Added a "Search city or region" header to the download resource group list, allowing direct access to the search dialog.
