refactor(ui): Use custom layout for remaining files section

Replaced `preference_with_descr` with a custom `LinearLayout` for
the remaining files section in `copy_files_fragment.xml`. This
provides more granular control over styling (e.g., padding, text
properties) and removes the need to explicitly hide an icon.
