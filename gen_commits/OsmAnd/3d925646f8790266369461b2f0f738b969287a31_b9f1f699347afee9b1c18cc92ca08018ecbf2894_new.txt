feat: Add Announcement Time bottom sheet for arrival distance factor

Introduce a dedicated bottom sheet to configure voice announcement timings.
This bottom sheet provides a seek bar for adjusting the arrival distance factor
and dynamically displays detailed time and distance intervals for various
prompts (turn, arrival, off-route, alarms, POI). It replaces the default
list preference dialog for the ARRIVAL_DISTANCE_FACTOR setting.
