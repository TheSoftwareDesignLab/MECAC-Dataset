refactor(widgets): Enhance configuration UI and back navigation

This commit introduces several improvements to the widget configuration screens:
- Refactors how `isVerticalPanel` is determined, deriving it directly from `WidgetsPanel` type.
- Updates `WeatherWidget` constructors to pass the associated `WidgetsPanel`.
- Adds a dedicated `WidgetsResetConfirmationBottomSheet` for reset actions.
- Improves back press handling in `ConfigureWidgetsFragment` to better manage fragment stack.
- Enhances "Add page/row" item styling to dynamically reflect panel orientation and apply profile colors.
- Reworks the empty state view for widget lists, including layout adjustments and a bottom shadow.
- Adjusts text sizes in search widget fragments and refines icon tinting for better consistency.
- Adds `fitsSystemWindows` to the widget settings info fragment for proper display.
