refactor: Prepare layer creation for native rendering

Adds createLayers(GLSurfaceView) to MapActivityLayers for native rendering.
NativeViewController is updated to call this new method. Layers are
instantiated but not yet added, serving as a placeholder for
future native rendering integration.

Also, prevent MapInfoLayer control recreation when native rendering is active.
