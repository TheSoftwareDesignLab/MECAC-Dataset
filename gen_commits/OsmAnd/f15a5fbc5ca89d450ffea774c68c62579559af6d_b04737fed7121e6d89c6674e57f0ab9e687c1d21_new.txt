fix: Handle foreground service startup exceptions

Wrap startForeground calls in try-catch blocks for NavigationService and
DownloadService. This prevents crashes and improves robustness by:
- Catching exceptions during foreground service startup.
- Logging errors and cleaning up service references if startup fails.
- Gracefully stopping the service when foreground startup is not allowed.
