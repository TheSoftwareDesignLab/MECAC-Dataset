fix: Update bearing widget on angular unit change

The bearing widget now correctly updates its displayed value when the user changes the angular units (e.g., degrees, mils) in the application settings. Previously, the widget would only re-render the bearing text when the bearing value itself changed, leading to an outdated format being displayed after a unit setting change. A new `StateChangedListener` ensures immediate refresh.
