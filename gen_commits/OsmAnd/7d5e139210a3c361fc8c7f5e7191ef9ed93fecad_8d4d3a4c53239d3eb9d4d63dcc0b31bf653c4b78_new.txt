feat: Expand base profile options and refine profile creation UI

- `NavigationFragment.getBaseProfiles` now includes all possible application modes,
  providing more base types for custom profiles.
- Corrected logic in `ProfileAppearanceFragment` to use `isNewProfile`
  for enabling base profile selection.
- Refactored `getBaseProfiles` by removing its `Context` parameter.
- Switched to `UiUtilities.getInflater` for consistent view inflation in
  `SelectProfileBottomSheetDialogFragment`.
