fix(i18n): Translate parking feature strings to Russian

Previously, parking-related strings in `values-ru/strings.xml` were untranslated, displaying English text. This commit provides the correct Russian translations for these strings.
Additionally, several new strings for monitoring and memory usage have been added to the file, awaiting future translation.
