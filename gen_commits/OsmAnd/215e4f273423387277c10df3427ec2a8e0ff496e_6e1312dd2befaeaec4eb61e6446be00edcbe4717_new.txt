feat: Revamp Tracks UI with new button type and consistent styling

- Renamed `tracks_empty_state.xml` to `empty_state.xml` for broader usage.
- Introduced `tab_title_view.xml` for custom tab title appearance.
- Added `TERTIARY` dialog button type and applied it to Tracks fragment action buttons.
- Standardized fragment backgrounds, status bar colors, and toolbar styling across Tracks-related screens.
- Refined `track_list_item.xml` layout with updated margins, padding, and text truncation.
- Improved color state list creation in `AndroidUtils` and `UiUtilities` for button and tab styling.
