fix: Enhance route info display and fragment safety

- Refactor `ShowRouteInfoDialogFragment` to dynamically update route cards upon destination street name resolution.
- Adjust layout heights and minimum heights for route info items and control buttons for improved UI responsiveness.
- Introduce lifecycle and null checks (`isAdded()`, `activity == null`) in several fragment classes to prevent crashes during detachment or uninitialised states.
- Minor padding adjustments for route segment visual consistency.
