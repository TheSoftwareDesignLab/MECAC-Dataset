refactor(backup): Introduce backup type controllers

Migrate backup type selection and version history screens to a Controller pattern.

This refactoring introduces `BaseBackupTypesController` to encapsulate common logic for managing backup types, including data collection, item selection, and deletion callbacks.

`BackupTypesController` and `VersionHistoryController` are implemented as specific controllers, handling preferences and clear types for their respective screens.

`BackupTypesFragment` is simplified to be a thin UI layer, delegating all business logic to its associated controller, which is registered via `DialogManager`. `BackupTypesAdapter` and `ClearTypesBottomSheet` are also updated to interact with the new controller.

This improves separation of concerns, enhances maintainability, and promotes code reuse.
