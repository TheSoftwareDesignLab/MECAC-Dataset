Introduces comprehensive multi-segment transport route planning.

- Enhanced route display with detailed information including total distance and stops to pass.
- Updated `TransportIndexRepository` to store and sort richer route segment information.
- Added new localization strings for transport features.
- Adjusted speed/bearing calculation in `MapActivity` for emulator-only use.
