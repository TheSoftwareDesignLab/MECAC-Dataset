refactor: Simplify route preparation in Android Auto

Remove `LoadTracksTask` (AsyncTask) to streamline route initialization.
`prepareRoute()` is now called directly in `onCreate()`.
Explicit `invalidate()` calls were added after route actions to ensure UI updates, replacing the `AsyncTask`'s `onPostExecute`.
Also, replaced `ObjectType.GPX_TRACK` with a static import for `GPX_TRACK`.
