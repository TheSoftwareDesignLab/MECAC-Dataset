feat: Implement support for derived routing profiles

This commit introduces the concept of "derived routing profiles," allowing base routing profiles to have specialized variations.

Key changes include:
- `RoutingDataObject` now includes a `derivedProfile` field.
- New `RoutingProfilesHolder` and `RoutingFile` classes manage profiles more effectively, considering both base and derived profiles.
- `RoutingDataUtils` updated to parse `derivedProfiles` from router attributes and create corresponding `RoutingDataObject` instances.
- UI components (MapActivityActions, SelectNavProfileBottomSheet, NavigationFragment) updated to correctly display, select, and manage these derived profiles, passing `derivedProfile` through bundle arguments.
- The `RoutingProfilesResources` enum has been moved to its own file.
