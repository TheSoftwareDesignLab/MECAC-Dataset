style: Add fallback colors and format CSS declarations

Introduce hardcoded color declarations before CSS variables for `h1`, `h4`,
`h5`, `a` elements and their `.nightmode` variants. This ensures a default
visual appearance if CSS custom properties are not fully supported or defined.

Correct minor formatting issues such as missing spaces in `background-size`
and splitting multiple declarations on one line for `pre` in night mode,
enhancing readability.
