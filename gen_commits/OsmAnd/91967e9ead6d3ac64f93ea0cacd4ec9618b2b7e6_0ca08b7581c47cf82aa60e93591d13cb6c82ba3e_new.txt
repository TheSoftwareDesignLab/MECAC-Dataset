refactor: Move native PT routing result classes to new package

Moved `NativeTransportRoutingResult` and its associated types (`NativeTransportRoute`, `NativeTransportStop`, `NativeTransportRouteResultSegment`) into the new `net.osmand.router.ptresult` package.

The corresponding conversion logic from these native types to `TransportRouteResult` objects has also been relocated from `TransportRoutingHelper` to `TransportRoutePlanner`. This change improves modularity by centralizing the native result structures and their conversion within dedicated areas.
