feat: Improve coordinate input EditText styling and refactor colors

Introduced custom styling for coordinate input EditText fields,
defining new theme attributes and colors for activated and normal states
to support both light and dark themes. Changed typeface for some dialog
text to Roboto Medium. Refactored color resolution and background
setting in `CoordinateInputDialogFragment` for better consistency.
