feat: Add 'Show on Map' for public transport routes

Implemented a "Show on Map" button on public transport route cards. The map now adjusts to fit the selected public transport route when shown or selected from the route picker.
Refactored route cards to use a consistent `build()` and `update()` pattern.
Updated public transport routing flow to navigate to route selection and allow direct map display.
