feat(routing): Suggest missing maps for route calculation

Introduce a new mechanism to detect and suggest missing offline maps required for route calculation.
The route calculation process now checks for necessary maps at start/end/intermediate points and along a straight line between them.
If required maps are not found, a `SuggestionsMapsDownloadWarningCard` is displayed in the route preparation menu, prompting the user to download them.
The route calculation can be stopped if critical maps are missing, or a warning displayed if maps are missing along the route's path.
Adds `SuggestionsMapsProvider` for map region detection and `findPointAtDistanceFrom` for generating intermediate points.
Enhances `OsmandRegions` and `DownloadActivityType` for displaying suggested map names.
Includes new UI strings for map download prompts and adjusts the start button state based on map availability.
