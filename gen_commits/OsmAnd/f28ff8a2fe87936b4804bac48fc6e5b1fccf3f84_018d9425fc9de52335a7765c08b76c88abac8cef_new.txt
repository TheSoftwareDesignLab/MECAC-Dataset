refactor: Remove redundant RTL orientation update logic

The `onResumeUpdate()` method in `MapInfoLayer`, along with the `oldRtlOrientation` field and `updateMapControlsButton()` helper, has been removed. This logic was responsible for detecting changes in RTL layout orientation upon activity resume and refreshing map control buttons accordingly. This mechanism is no longer needed, simplifying the `MapInfoLayer` and `MapActivity` `onResume` methods.
