feat: Add rendering attributes for polygon size and road density

- Introduce `polygonMinSizeToDisplay` to control minimum polygon area displayed.
- Add `roadDensityZoomTile` and `roadsDensityLimitPerTile` for density-based road filtering.
- Refactor rendering attribute initialization in native code to read from rules.
- Adjust shadow color for specific zoom levels in default rendering style.
