refactor: Replace ImageButton with ImageView in context menu

The action buttons in the map context menu (`route`, `favorite`, `share`, `more`) were refactored from `ImageButton` to `ImageView`.
This change updates the UI component and its corresponding type casting in the Java code.
Additionally, `android:scaleType="center"` was added for proper icon display, and the `android:tint` color was unified to `@color/actionbar_dark_color`.
