refactor: Enhance map zoom change listener with 'manual' flag

Renames `ManualZoomListener` to `MapZoomChangeListener` and introduces a `manual` boolean parameter to `onMapZoomChanged`.
This allows listeners to differentiate between user-initiated zoom changes and programmatic or continuous map zoom updates.

Existing components like `ExplorePlacesFragment` and `AutoZoomBySpeedHelper` are updated to use the new interface.
The `CoordinatesGridHelper` now registers directly as a `MapZoomChangeListener` to react to all zoom changes, rather than relying on direct calls from `OsmandMapTileView`.
