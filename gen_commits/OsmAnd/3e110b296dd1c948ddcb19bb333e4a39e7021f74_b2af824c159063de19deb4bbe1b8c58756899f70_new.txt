refactor: Improve adaptive display of measurement points

Reworked the logic for showing/hiding measurement tool points on the map.
Instead of a fixed 'start zoom', points are now adaptively displayed based on their density and the current map zoom level, ensuring a better user experience by preventing clutter at low zooms and showing detail at high zooms.
A new 'MIN_POINTS_PERCENTILE' and 'MIN_DISTANCE_TO_SHOW_REF_ZOOM' are used in 'calcZoomToShowPoints' to determine visibility.
