refactor: Refine memory info updates and fragment retention

Introduces task keys to differentiate memory calculation results, allowing for targeted updates (e.g., total usage only on tiles memory update).
Manages fragment retention using 'setRetainInstance' to ensure tasks are not interrupted by configuration changes.
