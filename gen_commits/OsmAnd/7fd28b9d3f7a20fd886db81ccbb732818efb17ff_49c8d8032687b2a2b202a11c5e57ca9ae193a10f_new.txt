refactor: Rework FontFitTextView with internal TextView

FontFitTextView now extends LinearLayout and manages an internal TextView. This change provides a more robust and flexible approach to dynamic text sizing and layout, especially for titles.

- Integrated the refactored FontFitTextView into CustomTitleBar and SearchByNameAbstractActivity.
- Added 'ending_point_too_far' string resource and used it in RouteProvider for routing error messages.
- Removed outdated TODO comments from BinaryRoutePlanner.
