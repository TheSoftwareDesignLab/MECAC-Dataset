feat(a11y): Improve TalkBack accessibility for fragment navigation

Introduced a mechanism to dynamically manage accessibility focus for TalkBack across various activities. When multiple fragments are present, only the currently active fragment's content is exposed to TalkBack, while underlying fragments or activity content are hidden using `IMPORTANT_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY_NO_HIDE_DESCENDANTS`. This prevents TalkBack from announcing elements from inactive screens, enhancing user experience.

- Implemented in `MapActivity`, `OsmandInAppPurchaseActivity`, `DownloadActivity`, `MyPlacesActivity`, and `WikivoyageExploreActivity`.
- Added `pager_content` ID to `tab_content.xml` for specific layout targeting.
