feat: Add option to prevent context menu dismissal

Introduces an `isHideable()` method in `ContextMenuFragment` to control whether a menu can be automatically dismissed. By default, menus are hideable.

The `GpxApproximationFragment` now overrides `isHideable()` to return `false`, preventing its automatic dismissal. It also supports a new `HEADER_ONLY` state in portrait mode for a more compact view and adjusts its layout calculation to include the slider card height.
