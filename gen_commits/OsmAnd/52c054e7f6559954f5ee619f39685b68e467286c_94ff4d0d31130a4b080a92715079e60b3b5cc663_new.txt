fix: Improve moving time calculation robustness

Introduce `myLocationTime` to track the time when a location update is processed.
Calculate `movingTime` based on `System.currentTimeMillis()` and this processing time,
instead of relying solely on `Location.getTime()`. This makes the calculation more
robust against potential inconsistencies or delays in sensor timestamps.
