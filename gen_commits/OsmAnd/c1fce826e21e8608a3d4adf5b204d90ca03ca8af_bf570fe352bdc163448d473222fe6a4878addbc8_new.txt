feat: Implement tablet landscape dashboard layout

This commit introduces a dedicated two-column dashboard layout for tablets when in landscape orientation.
The `dashboard.xml` layout for `large-land` is added, defining `content` and `content_land` containers.
The `MainMenuActivity` now conditionally places `DashSearchFragment`, `DashDownloadMapsFragment`, and `DashPluginsFragment` into the `content_land` column, while other dashboard fragments remain in the `content` column.
This optimizes the use of screen real estate on larger displays.
