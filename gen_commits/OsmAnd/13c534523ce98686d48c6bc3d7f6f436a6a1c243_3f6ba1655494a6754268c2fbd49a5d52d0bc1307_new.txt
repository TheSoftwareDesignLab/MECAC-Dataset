feat: Enhance Zoom Level widget with Map Scale option

The Zoom Level map widget now supports two display modes: current zoom level and map scale.
- Introduced `ZoomLevelWidgetState` to manage the widget's display type preference.
- Added a dedicated settings screen (`ZoomLevelSettingsFragment`) for the widget to configure the display mode.
- Tapping the widget will also cycle between the available display modes.
- Updated `TextInfoWidget` visibility logic to correctly handle cases where only subtext is present.
