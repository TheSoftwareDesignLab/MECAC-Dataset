refactor: Improve handling of unknown search phrase parts

Replaced `lastWord` in `SearchPhrase` with `unknownSearchPhrase` and `unknownSearchWordTrim` for more robust parsing.
Introduced `isUnknownSearchWordComplete()` to dynamically adjust string matching mode (exact vs. starts with).
Updated various search APIs (e.g., Region, City, Amenity, Favorite, Recent) to leverage the new phrase components for more accurate filtering and result generation.
Simplified location and URL parsing by using the complete unknown search phrase.
Changed `SearchResult.wordsSpan` from integer to string to store the matched text span.
