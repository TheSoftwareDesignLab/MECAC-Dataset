fix(de-translation): Correct accuracy/precision definition

Corrected the German string `monitoring_min_accuracy_descr` to accurately define "Genauigkeit" (accuracy) as closeness to the true position and "Präzision" (precision) as the spread of repeated measurements. Previously, these definitions were swapped.
