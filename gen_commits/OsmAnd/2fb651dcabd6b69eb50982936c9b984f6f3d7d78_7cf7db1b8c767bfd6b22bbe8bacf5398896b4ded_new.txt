feat: Add crash log icon to dashboard error fragment

Introduces a crash log icon to the error message displayed on the dashboard.
Refactors dashboard map fragment margins for consistency, using `subHeaderPadding` instead of a dedicated `dashMapMargin`, which is now removed.
Includes a minor code cleanup in `DashMapFragment.java`.
