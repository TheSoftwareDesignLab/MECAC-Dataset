feat: Preserve scroll position when opening track selection

Introduces `ScreenPositionData` to store the screen position of a reference item.
When opening TracksSelectionFragment from a specific item's context menu or long-press, the fragment will now scroll to that item, attempting to maintain its previous vertical screen position. This enhances user experience by preserving visual context.
