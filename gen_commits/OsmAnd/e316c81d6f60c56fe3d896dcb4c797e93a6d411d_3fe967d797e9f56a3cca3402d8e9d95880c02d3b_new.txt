refactor: Remove ClientContext and use OsmandApplication directly

The ClientContext interface has been removed as it primarily served as
an abstraction over OsmandApplication for common context methods.
All prior usages now directly leverage OsmandApplication.

Additionally, internal API calls for version information, device details,
and native library access have been simplified by either moving methods
to OsmandApplication or accessing them directly where appropriate.
