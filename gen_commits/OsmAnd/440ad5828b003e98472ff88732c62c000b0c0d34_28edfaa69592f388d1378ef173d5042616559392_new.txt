feat: Add AIDL API for screen lock/unlock

Introduces a new AIDL method `setLockState` to programmatically lock
or unlock the OsmAnd screen from external applications.

This includes defining `SetLockStateParams`, implementing the AIDL service
and API handling, and exposing `lock()` and `unlock()` methods in `LockHelper`.
