feat: Add transparent map theme for UI controls

Introduces an option to use transparent backgrounds for map information controls.

This includes:
- New 9-patch drawables and selector XMLs for transparent UI elements.
- An "Appearance" settings screen with a "Transparent theme" preference.
- Dynamic application of the selected theme to map controls (e.g., speed, distance, time, next turn, minimap, status bar).
- Shadow text rendering to enhance readability against varied map backgrounds.
- Sets transparent theme as default for pedestrian mode.
