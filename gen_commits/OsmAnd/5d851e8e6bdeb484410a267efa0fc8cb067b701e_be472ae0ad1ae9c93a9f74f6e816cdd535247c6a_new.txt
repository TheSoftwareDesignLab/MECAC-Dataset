feat: Enhance map labels with multi-line text and detailed styling

Introduces multi-line text wrapping for map labels exceeding a defined width.
Refactors text rendering logic to apply specific styles (size, color, shadow, position, bold) for a wide range of map features (points, polygons) based on their type, subtype, and zoom level via `renderObjectText`.
Refines entity name extraction in `MapRenderingTypes.getEntityName` to consider object type for `ref` and `ele` tags.
Adds support for `waterway=lock` feature.
