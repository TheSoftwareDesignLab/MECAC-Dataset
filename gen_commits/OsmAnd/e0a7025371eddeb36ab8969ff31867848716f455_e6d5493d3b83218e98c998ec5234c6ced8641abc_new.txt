feat: Add collapsing app bar to Edit POI screen

Refactors the Edit POI dialog layout using CoordinatorLayout and AppBarLayout.
This enables a collapsing toolbar effect, improving screen real estate.
Input fields are made non-focusable/clickable when the app bar is collapsed.
Removes NestedScrollView and updates associated scrolling logic in child fragments.
