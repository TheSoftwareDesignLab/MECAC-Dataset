refactor: Refine target point movability and update logic

Restricts map dragging to only the current navigation target. This prevents accidental modification of intermediate waypoints.
The `setLocation` method was removed from `TargetPoint`, and the logic in `applyNewObjectPosition` was streamlined to directly call `navigateToPoint` when moving the target, centralizing the update process.
