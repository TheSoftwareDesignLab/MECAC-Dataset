feat: Refactor routing type and auto-zoom preferences

Consolidate multiple boolean routing preferences into a single `RoutingType` enum with options for A* 2-phase, A* classic, HH Java, and HH C++. Update the UI in Development and Route Parameters settings to use this new enum and dedicated pop-up menus for GPX approximation and auto-zoom. Implement migration logic to ensure existing user preferences are carried over to the new enum. Also, rename the `USE_V1_AUTO_ZOOM` preference to `USE_DISCRETE_AUTO_ZOOM`.
