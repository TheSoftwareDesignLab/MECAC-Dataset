feat: Enhance UI fragments with ApplicationMode context

This commit introduces ApplicationMode context to several UI components,
enabling more dynamic and context-aware rendering, particularly for night mode.

- Pass ApplicationMode to SelectProfileBottomSheet and OnlineRoutingEngineFragment
  instance creation methods.
- Update OnlineRoutingSegmentCard constructor to accept night mode,
  derived from the ApplicationMode.
- Add AndroidUiHelper.setVisibility for efficient management of view visibility.
- Disable 'saveEnabled' for EditText in online_routing_preference_segment.xml
  to control state restoration manually.
- Reorder super.onCreate() call within BasePreferenceBottomSheet.
