feat(voice): Handle audio focus during voice guidance

Implement `AudioManager.requestAudioFocus` and `abandonAudioFocus` to correctly manage audio interactions with other applications. This ensures that OsmAnd's voice guidance properly requests and releases audio focus, pausing other media players as needed and resuming them when guidance is complete.

Refactor `MediaCommandPlayerImpl` to use `MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener` for sequential playback, improving the robustness and clarity of the voice command playback logic. Extract delay handling and file retrieval into dedicated private methods and release the MediaPlayer only after all queued commands are played.
