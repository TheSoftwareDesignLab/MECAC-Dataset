feat: Implement initial speed camera alert and uninstall flow

Introduce a bottom sheet dialog to inform users about speed cameras when starting route planning for the first time.

This change also unifies the "uninstall speed cameras" functionality:
- Added `SPEED_CAMERAS_ALERT_SHOWED` and `SPEED_CAMERAS_UNINSTALLED` preferences for persistence.
- The "uninstall" action in the bottom sheet now disables speed camera speaking and display, and hides related preferences in Global, Screen Alerts, and Voice Announces settings.
- Removed the separate confirmation dialog when enabling 'Speak speed camera'.
