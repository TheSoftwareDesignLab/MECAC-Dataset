feat(search-test): Allow specifying 'extra-results' in search JSON tests

Introduces an 'extra-results' section in search test JSON files. This enables more comprehensive testing by allowing the specification of secondary search results beyond the primary top results.

Other changes include:
- Reordered 'UNKNOWN_PHRASE_MATCH_WEIGHT' in ResultCompareStep enum.
- Removed unused imports and renamed 'testSearchImpl' to 'testSearch' in SearchUICoreTest.
- Added 'navacerrada.json' as a new test case.
- Refactored 'free_street_portland.json' to use the new 'extra-results' structure.
