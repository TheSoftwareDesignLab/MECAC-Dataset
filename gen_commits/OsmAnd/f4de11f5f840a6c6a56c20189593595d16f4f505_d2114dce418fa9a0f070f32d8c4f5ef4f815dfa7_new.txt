feat: Overhaul audio focus with Android 8+ API

Updates audio focus management to leverage AudioAttributes and AudioFocusRequest for devices running Android 8.0 (API 26) and higher.

This change includes:
- Using AudioAttributes and AudioFocusRequest for improved audio focus control.
- Inhibiting audio playback until focus is granted.
- Enhanced handling of various audio focus change events (LOSS, TRANSIENT, DUCK).
- Renamed `requestFocus` to `requestAudFocus` and `abandonFocus` to `abandonAudFocus` for clarity.
