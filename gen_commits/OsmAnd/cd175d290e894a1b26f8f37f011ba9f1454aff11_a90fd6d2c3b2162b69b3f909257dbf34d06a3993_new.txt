refactor(gpx): Migrate icons to app:srcCompat and limit text lines

Updated image and button drawables to use 'app:srcCompat' for better compatibility with vector assets across different Android versions.
Added 'android:maxLines="1"' to several TextViews (distance, points count, time, description) to ensure content is displayed on a single line within the GPX track item layout.
