fix: Correctly parse navigation intent URI in Car app

For `ACTION_NAVIGATE` intents, construct the URI from `intent.getDataString()` by prepending "http://". This ensures proper handling of navigation data passed as a string. Also, add an early exit after processing navigation intents and reintroduce a null check for general URIs.
