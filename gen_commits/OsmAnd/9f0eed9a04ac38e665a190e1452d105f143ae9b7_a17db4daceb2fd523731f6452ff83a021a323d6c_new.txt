fix(route-prep): Use correct work point for 'Work' option

Fixes a bug where selecting 'Work' in the add point bottom sheet dialog
would incorrectly retrieve the 'Home' point's coordinates.

Also moved the `FAVOURITES` string constant from `FavouritesDbHelper`
to `AddPointBottomSheetDialog` and removed an unused `LinearLayout` import.
