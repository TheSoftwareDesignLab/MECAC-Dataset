refactor: Improve map animations and layer drawing

Refactor map animation threads for dragging, zooming, and rotation.
Extract common rotation animation into `pendingRotateAnimation`.
Implement new `startZooming` with `AccelerateInterpolator` for smoother zoom.
Standardize animation sleep delay to `DEFAULT_SLEEP_TO_REDRAW`.
Update `drawOverMap` to use independent canvas saves/restores for each layer,
allowing correct rotation application and state management.
