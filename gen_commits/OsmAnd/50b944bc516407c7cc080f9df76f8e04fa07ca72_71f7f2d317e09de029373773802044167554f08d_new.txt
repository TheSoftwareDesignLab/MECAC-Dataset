feat: Implement generic single selection bottom sheet

Introduce a reusable bottom sheet for displaying single-choice preference options.
It replaces the previous UI for the "Motor type" setting in Vehicle Parameters.
This commit also updates related strings for clarity, including renaming "Motor type" to "Fuel used by motor" and changing "None" to "Not selected".
