fix: Correctly manage 'Turn screen on by power button' preference

Marked the 'Turn screen on by power button' preference as non-persistent to enable full programmatic control over its state. The switch's enabled status now correctly depends on global 'Turn screen on' settings (infinite time or system timeout). Explicitly set the checked state based on both the global enablement and the application mode specific setting for the power button option.
