fix: Adjust route info dialog position and initial display

The route info dialog's vertical position now correctly incorporates the `extraVerticalMargin` from `MapControls`, ensuring proper placement relative to the info button.
Removed the automatic display of the route info dialog on activity initialization when no navigation target is set. The dialog will now only appear when the info button is explicitly clicked.
