refactor: Standardize list item spacing with padding

Refactored several list item layouts (e.g., category, GPX track, local index) to use `paddingLeft`/`paddingStart` instead of `layout_marginLeft`/`layout_marginStart` for inner spacing. This ensures more consistent layout behavior.

Where appropriate, `paddingRight="0dp"` and `paddingEnd="0dp"` were added to maintain existing layouts. Some `FrameLayout` elements were converted to `LinearLayout` to facilitate direct padding application. Also, standardized a margin in `search_list_item` to use `@dimen/content_padding`.
