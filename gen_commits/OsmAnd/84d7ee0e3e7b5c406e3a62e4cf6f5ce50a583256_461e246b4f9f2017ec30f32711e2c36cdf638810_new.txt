fix: Improve multi-touch zoom and rotation gesture recognition

Refines map multi-touch handling to more accurately distinguish between
zoom and rotation gestures. Introduces a zoom threshold and dedicated
flags to ensure that only one gesture (zoom or rotation) is active
at a time once its respective threshold is crossed.
The angle threshold for rotation detection has been significantly
reduced from 30 to 5 degrees for improved responsiveness.
