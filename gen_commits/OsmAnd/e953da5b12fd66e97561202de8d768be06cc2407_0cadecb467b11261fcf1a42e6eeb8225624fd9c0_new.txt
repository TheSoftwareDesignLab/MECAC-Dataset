feat: Add network approximation option for online routing

Introduce a new option to approximate GPX tracks using network-based routing for online engines. This allows users to choose between local map-based or network-based approximation when attaching GPX tracks to roads. A new `NETWORK_APPROXIMATE_ROUTE` engine parameter is added, and the UI is updated to reflect and store this preference. The `android:saveEnabled="false"` attribute is added to the approximation checkbox to ensure its state is consistently managed by the application logic.
