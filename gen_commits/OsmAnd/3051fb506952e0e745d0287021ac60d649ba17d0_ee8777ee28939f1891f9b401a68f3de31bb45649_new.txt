refactor(routes): Streamline route selection UI and flow

Replace RouteDetailsFragment with ChooseRouteFragment for displaying route options.
Introduce a new method to allow ChooseRouteFragment to restore the
previous MapRouteInfoMenu state.

Enhance toolbar button styling in the route selection fragment:
- Add a new circular transparent drawable for button backgrounds.
- Standardize button sizes with a new dimension resource.
- Refactor toolbar layout for consistency.
- Simplify logic for hiding route action buttons in public transport mode.

Apply ContextThemeWrapper for correct theme application in ChooseRouteFragment
and ContextMenuFragment during view inflation.
