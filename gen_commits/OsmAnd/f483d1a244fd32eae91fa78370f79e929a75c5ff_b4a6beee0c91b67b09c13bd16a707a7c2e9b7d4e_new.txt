fix: Improve route dialog dismissal and refine UI device detection

- Introduced `RoutePrepareDialog` to manage `OnDismissListener` lifecycle explicitly.
- Ensures `onDismiss` is called when route preference dialogs are dismissed programmatically.
- Refactored `isLargeDevice` to `isXLargeDevice` for precise XLARGE screen detection.
- Adjusted "Go" button text visibility in `MapControlsLayer` to be empty in landscape mode.
