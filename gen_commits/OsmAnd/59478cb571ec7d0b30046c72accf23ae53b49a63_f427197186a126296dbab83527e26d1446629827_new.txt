feat: Improve auto-zoom behavior based on user interaction

Introduces a mechanism to detect and track when a user manually changes the map zoom level using the on-screen controls.
This prevents the auto-zoom feature from immediately overriding the user's manual zoom adjustments, making it more intelligent and less intrusive.
The auto-zoom logic now considers the 'isUserZoomed' flag and a recent zoom timestamp.
