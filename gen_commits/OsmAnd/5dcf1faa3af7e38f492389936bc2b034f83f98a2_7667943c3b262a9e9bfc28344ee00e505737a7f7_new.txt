refactor: Unify landscape panel widths and simplify layout logic

Consolidates landscape side panel widths across multiple fragments (object selection, route info, point editor) to consistently use `@dimen/dashboard_land_width`.

Simplifies `isLandscapeLayout()` logic by removing the `largeDevice` check in various components, now solely relying on the orientation. This impacts audio/video notes, map context menu, point editor, map route info, and map markers widgets.

Further UI adjustments include:
- Toolbar button heights set to `match_parent` for better vertical alignment.
- Toolbar title text size increased.
- Building number icons (`ic_action_building_number`) now use `centerInside` scaleType.
- Minor adjustment to menu shadow height.
