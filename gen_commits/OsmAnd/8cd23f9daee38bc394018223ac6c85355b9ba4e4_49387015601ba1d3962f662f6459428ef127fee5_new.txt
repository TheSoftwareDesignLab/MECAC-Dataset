refactor: Simplify coordinate keyboard item layout spacing

Removed redundant vertical spacer views from keyboard item layouts.
Padding is now applied directly to the `AppCompatTextView` elements to
control vertical spacing, improving layout clarity and consistency.
Adjusted "Add" button padding in the coordinate input dialog accordingly.
