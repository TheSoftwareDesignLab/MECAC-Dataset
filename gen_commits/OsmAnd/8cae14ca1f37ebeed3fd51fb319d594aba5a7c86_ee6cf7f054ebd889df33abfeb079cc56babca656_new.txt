fix: Enable bidirectional swipe-to-dismiss functionality

The swipe-to-dismiss mechanism was previously biased towards right-swipes,
or its detection was asymmetric. This commit introduces `Math.abs()` for
distance checks and removes `isSwipeRight` conditions, allowing dismiss
actions to be properly detected and triggered for both left and right
horizontal swipes.

The dismiss callback now fires consistently when a dismiss gesture is
performed, irrespective of the swipe direction.
