feat: Improve track color transparency display and GPX points

Visually indicate color transparency in track appearance previews and color selection.
Added `UiUtilities.removeAlpha` for removing the alpha channel from a color.
Refactored `CustomColorBottomSheet` to handle initial color selection more robustly.
Improved GPX start/end point rendering to avoid overlapping icons when close on the map.
Replaced `ic_action_add` with `ic_action_plus` icon.
