feat: Redesign GPX Quick Action dialog for tracks/waypoints

The GPX Quick Action dialog has been fully redesigned to offer more control and a better user experience.

Key changes include:
- Introduced "Track file" section with options to either always prompt for a GPX file or use a pre-selected one.
- Added "Waypoint appearance" section, allowing users to define default waypoint name, icon, color, and category, or always ask for input.
- Replaced basic switch with multi-state toggles for enhanced configurability.
- Added new oval button and ripple drawables for consistent UI styling.
