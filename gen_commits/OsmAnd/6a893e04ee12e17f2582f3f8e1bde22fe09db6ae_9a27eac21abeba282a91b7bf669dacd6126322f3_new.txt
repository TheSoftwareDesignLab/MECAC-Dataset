feat: Implement audio/video recorder split

Adds a new "Recorder Split" feature to manage continuous audio/video
recording. This allows users to configure recordings to be split into
clips of a defined length and introduces a loop recording mechanism
that rewrites older clips when a specified total storage size is exceeded.

Introduces preferences for:
- Enabling/disabling the recorder split
- Setting the maximum length for individual recorded clips
- Defining the total storage space allocated for all recorded clips
