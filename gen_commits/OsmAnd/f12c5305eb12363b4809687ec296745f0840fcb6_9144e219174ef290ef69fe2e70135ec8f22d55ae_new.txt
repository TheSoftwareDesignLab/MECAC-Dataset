fix(geometry): Correctly cut cached paths and update distance

Adjusts the path cutting logic to accurately accumulate passed distance when
handling previously visible segments. Prevents premature returns and ensures
correct `updatePathLine` calls based on the accumulated distance.
Also considers very short path segments for cutting.
