refactor: Improve waypoint display and dashboard refresh logic

Refactor waypoint handling to allow non-centered map positioning and simplify dialog integration.
Enhance dashboard refresh mechanism to support forced updates, ensuring consistency after map configuration changes.
Update UI elements, including transparent button pressed state, overflow menu icon for waypoint info, and remove unused plugin option icons.
