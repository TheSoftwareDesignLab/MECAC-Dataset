feat: Add 'Create New Folder' option for tracks

- Users can now create a new track folder directly from the "Save As New Track" and "Move GPX File" bottom sheets.
- An "Add new folder" item is included in the track folder selection list.
- The track name input field now uses `textCapSentences` for better usability.
