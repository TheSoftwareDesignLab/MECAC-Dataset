feat: Expose voice navigation commands and played messages

Added `getCommands()` and `getPlayed()` methods to `OnVoiceNavigationParams` in both the OsmAnd-api and OsmAnd modules. This allows external applications to retrieve the lists of voice navigation commands and messages that were played.

Updated OsmAnd-api version to 2.0.0.
