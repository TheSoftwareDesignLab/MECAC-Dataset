refactor: Extract night mode widget text color to resource

Moves the hardcoded night mode text color (0xffC8C8C8) into a new color resource 'widgettext_night' in colors.xml. MapControlsLayer and MapInfoLayer now reference this resource for consistency. Includes minor reordering of color definitions in colors.xml.
