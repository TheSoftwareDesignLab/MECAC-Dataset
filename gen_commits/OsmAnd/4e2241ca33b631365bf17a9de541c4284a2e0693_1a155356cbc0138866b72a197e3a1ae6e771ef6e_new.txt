feat: Apply dynamic color to clear cache description

This commit introduces dynamic coloring for the description text of the "Clear Cache" option within the Wikivoyage options bottom sheet. The color will now adapt to either `wikivoyage_active_dark` or `wikivoyage_active_light` based on the current night mode setting, improving readability and UI consistency.
