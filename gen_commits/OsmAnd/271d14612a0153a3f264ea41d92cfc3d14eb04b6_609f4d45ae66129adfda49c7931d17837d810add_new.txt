fix: Refine dialog corner radii and landscape width handling

Reduced bottom corner radii of top menu and top sheet drawables from 4dp to 3dp.
Refactored OsmandSheetDialog to use a specific container ID for its content FrameLayout,
and updated DownloadMapDialogFragment to apply landscape width adjustments to this
container, improving precise control over dialog content sizing and appearance.
