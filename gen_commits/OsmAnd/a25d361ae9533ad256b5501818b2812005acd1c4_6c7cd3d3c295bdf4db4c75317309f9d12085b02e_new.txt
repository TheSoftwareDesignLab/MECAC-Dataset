refactor: Centralize UI handler message IDs into OsmAndConstants

Introduces a new OsmAndConstants interface to define base UI handler message IDs.
Replaces various hardcoded integer message IDs across multiple files with references
to these new constants, improving code readability and maintainability by
eliminating magic numbers.

Also adjusts START_LOCATION_SIMULATION_DELAY from 4000 to 3000ms.
