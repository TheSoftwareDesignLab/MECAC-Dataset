feat: Improve OPR login screen and refactor image handling

- Added a ScrollView to `fragment_opr_login.xml` to ensure the content is always accessible, preventing cut-off issues on smaller screens.
- Extracted `GetImageCardsListener` into a dedicated field in `MenuBuilder.java` for better code reusability and readability.
- Moved the `OPRImage` class to be an inner class of `OpenDBAPI.java`, centralizing related code and simplifying the project structure.
