feat: Auto-enter edit mode for new key assignments

New key assignments now automatically start in edit mode upon creation.
This commit also includes extensive refactoring:
- Renamed controller methods for clarity (e.g., `createInstance`, `getExistedInstance`).
- Introduced `isNewAssignment()` to differentiate behavior for new vs. existing assignments.
- Unified UI update methods in key assignment fragments (`updateScreenMode`).
- Added a top divider to the bottom button layouts for consistent UI.
