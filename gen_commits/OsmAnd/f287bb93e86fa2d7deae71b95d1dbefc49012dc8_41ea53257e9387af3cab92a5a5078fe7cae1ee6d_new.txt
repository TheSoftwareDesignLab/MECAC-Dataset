refactor: Move POI tag strings to no_translate.xml

Moved `tag_poi_name` and `tag_poi_amenity` to `no_translate.xml` to prevent translation, ensuring they are used as literal OSM tags.
Improved webview display for help articles by enabling overview mode and wide viewport.
Pre-filled POI type field with amenity sub-type in the POI edit dialog.
Refined back button handling in the POI edit dialog when unsaved changes exist.
