feat: Add lifecycle hooks for Map Context Menu controllers

Introduces `onClose()` and `onAcquireNewController()` methods to the `MenuController` to improve state management.

- `MapContextMenu` now notifies the currently active controller via `onAcquireNewController()` before creating a new one.
- `TransportRouteController` implements these hooks to ensure the transport route highlighting is correctly cleared when the menu is dismissed or a different transport stop's menu is opened.
- Fixes the drawing order in `TransportStopsLayer` to render routes before stop icons.
- Corrects the icon selection logic for transport stops in the menu list.
