feat: Display local resource install date in download list

Adds a `mapDateTextView` to `two_line_with_images_list_item.xml` to show the local installation date of downloaded items.
The date text is colored to indicate if the resource is outdated.

Refactor `ItemViewHolder` and related fragments to provide necessary data for date display.
Includes minor adjustments to the free version banner collapsing logic in `DownloadActivity`.
