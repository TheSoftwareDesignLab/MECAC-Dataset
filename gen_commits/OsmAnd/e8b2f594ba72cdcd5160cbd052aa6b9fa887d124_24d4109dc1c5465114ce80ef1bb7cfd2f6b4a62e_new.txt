feat: Allow layers to restrict map gestures

Introduces a mechanism for OsmandMapLayer implementations to control specific map gestures.
The OsmandMapTileView now queries active layers via `isMapGestureAllowed` before performing gestures such as double-tap zoom in/change and two-pointer zoom out.
The RulerControlLayer uses this to prevent two-pointer zoom out when the ruler is active, avoiding interference with distance measurement.
