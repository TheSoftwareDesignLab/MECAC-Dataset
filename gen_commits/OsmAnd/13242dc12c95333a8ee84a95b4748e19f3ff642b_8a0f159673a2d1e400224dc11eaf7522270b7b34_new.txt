fix: Handle pending compass rotation when view angle suppressed

Introduce a `pendingRotation` flag to manage compass-based map rotation
when the view angle is temporarily suppressed (e.g., during route planning).
This ensures the rotation state is correctly captured and can be handled
appropriately, preventing immediate animation where it's not desired.

Also, restrict `startRotate` to only execute when no other animations are active.
