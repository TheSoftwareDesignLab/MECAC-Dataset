feat: Enhance drawer_list_doubleitem layout for icon display

Refactor `drawer_list_doubleitem.xml` to include an ImageView for displaying icons and streamline layout attributes. Replace `R.layout.two_line_list_item` with the enhanced `R.layout.drawer_list_doubleitem` for map overlay and underlay selections.

Includes minor Java refactorings such as diamond operator usage, null-safety checks for callbacks, and simpler AsyncTask execution.
