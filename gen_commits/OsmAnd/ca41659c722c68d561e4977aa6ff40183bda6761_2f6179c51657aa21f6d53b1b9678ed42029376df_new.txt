feat(obd): Auto-reconnect last device and improve instructions UI

Automatically connect to the last paired OBD-II scanner when a car navigation session is initiated.
Refactor the OBD connection instructions layout to display steps explicitly numbered in the UI, enhancing readability. The numeric prefixes have been removed from the corresponding string resources.

Simplify settings API by removing 'getAppModeFloatPreference' in favor of 'getFloatPreference'.
Improve Bluetooth device discovery by filtering out devices without an alias name, preventing "unknown" entries.
Add 'onCarNavigationSessionCreated' plugin hook for extended lifecycle management.
