feat: Implement MGRS grid format and refactor suffix logic

Introduce support for the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) as a new grid format option.

Centralize the logic for determining when coordinate suffixes (N, S, E, W) should be displayed into the GridFormat enum. This ensures that suffixes are correctly omitted for both UTM and MGRS coordinate systems, and simplifies future additions of non-suffixed grid formats.
