feat: Enhance map fitting algorithm with precise rectangle check

The `fitRectToMap` method now uses a new `fullyContains` check to accurately
determine if a geographic rectangle is fully contained within the map's
viewport. This replaces the less precise `containsRectInRotatedRect` method,
improving the robustness of fitting regions to the map view.
The default `fitRectToMap` overload also now consistently uses small zoom
steps (0.1f) for smoother adjustments.
