feat: Revamp settings import/export with duplicate handling

This commit introduces a comprehensive overhaul of the settings import and export functionality, significantly improving the user experience, especially when dealing with existing items.

Key changes include:
- **Duplicate Handling:** Implemented robust detection and handling for duplicate profiles, quick actions, POI filters, map sources, and custom files (rendering styles, routing files) during import. Users can now choose to replace existing items or keep both (with a "copy_" prefix).
- **UI Improvements:** The import/export interface has been redesigned, including new layouts for item groups and children, and a dedicated `ExportImportSettingsAdapter` for better presentation and interaction.
- **`ITileSource` Enhancements:** Added a `setName(String name)` method to `ITileSource` and its `SQLiteTileSource` implementation to facilitate renaming of map sources during import when duplicates are kept.
- **Database Robustness:** Modified `SQLiteTileSource` to use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST` statements, preventing errors if tables already exist.
- **Code Refactoring:** Refactored `ImportSettingsFragment`, `ImportDuplicatesFragment`, and related adapters for improved modularity and maintainability.
