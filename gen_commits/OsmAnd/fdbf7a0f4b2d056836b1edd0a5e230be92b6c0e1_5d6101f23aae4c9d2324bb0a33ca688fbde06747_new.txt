feat: Improve GPX overview with dynamic stats and analysis

- Replaced static GPX overview statistics with dynamically calculated values from GPXTrackAnalysis.
- Tapping on individual statistics (e.g., distance, ascent) now opens a corresponding analysis chart on the map via `GpxUiHelper`.
- Includes various UI/layout adjustments and a new color for improved presentation.
