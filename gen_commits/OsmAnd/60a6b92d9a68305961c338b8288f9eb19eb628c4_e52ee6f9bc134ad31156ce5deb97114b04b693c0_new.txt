feat: Add content descriptions to various UI elements for accessibility

Many non-textual UI elements lacked content descriptions, impacting accessibility.
This change introduces `android:contentDescription` attributes, leveraging
existing string resources, to provide meaningful labels for screen readers
and enhance usability for all users.
