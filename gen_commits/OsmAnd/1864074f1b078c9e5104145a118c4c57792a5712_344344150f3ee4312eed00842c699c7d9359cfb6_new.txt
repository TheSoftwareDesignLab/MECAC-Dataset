refactor: Improve opening hours parsing and serialization

Refactors the internal handling of opening hours in AHSupermarketResolver.
Switches from a list of rules to the dedicated OpeningHours object and
utilizes its methods for adding rules and time ranges, as well as its
toString() method for consistent serialization.
