feat: Enhance accessibility and navigation feedback in search lists

Integrates NavigationInfo to provide real-time directional feedback for selected items
in Favorites, History, and POI search results.

- Introduces NavigationInfo in SearchActivity and updates it with location.
- Manages compass listeners to ensure NavigationInfo updates are received correctly
  within list fragments (Favorites and History).
- Updates target direction in FavoritesListFragment, SearchHistoryFragment,
  and SearchPOIActivity when a list item is focused and the compass heading changes.
- Improves accessibility by locking/unlocking event updates during list refreshes
  and setting accessibility delegates for list rows in search fragments.
- Corrects item index calculation for `amenityAdapter` in SearchPOIActivity.
