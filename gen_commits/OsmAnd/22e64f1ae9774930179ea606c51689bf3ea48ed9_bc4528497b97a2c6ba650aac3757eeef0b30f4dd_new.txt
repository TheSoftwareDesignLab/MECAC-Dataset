feat: Add profile availability switch to Configure Profile toolbar

Introduces a new toolbar layout with a subtitle and a toggle switch for
the Configure Profile screen. This allows users to enable or disable
the currently viewed profile directly from the toolbar.

The ConfigureProfileFragment has been updated to use the new
`profile_preference_toolbar_with_switch` layout and includes logic to
handle the profile availability toggle and update its UI state.
