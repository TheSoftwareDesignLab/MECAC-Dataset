refactor: Simplify map fitting and zoom level adjustments

The `fitRectToMap` method no longer supports fractional zoom (the `useSmallZoom` parameter and associated logic have been removed). The `Zoom.partialChangeZoom` method has also been removed. Map rectangle fitting now consistently uses integer zoom levels.

Additionally:
- Removed automatic map adjustment when a new route is calculated in `RoutePreviewScreen`.
- The route info menu (`MapRouteInfoMenu`) will now always open after route calculation, regardless of car view status.
