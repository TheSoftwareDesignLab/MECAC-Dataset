refactor: Enhance profile selection dialog context handling

The `SelectProfileBottomSheetDialogFragment` now extends `BasePreferenceBottomSheet`
to better integrate with preference-related dialogs.

This change also ensures that the dialog receives the current `ApplicationMode`
and a `usedOnMap` flag when opened from various settings fragments.

Additionally, `NavigationFragment.getBaseProfiles` now accepts an `OsmandApplication`
instance, enabling the retrieval of more comprehensive profile descriptions.
The `setAppMode` method in `BasePreferenceBottomSheet` has been made public
to facilitate these external context assignments.
