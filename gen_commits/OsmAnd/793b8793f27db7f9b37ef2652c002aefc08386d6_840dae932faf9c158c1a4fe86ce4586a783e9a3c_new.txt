refactor: Centralize system UI visibility logic

Moved `showSystemUI()` call into `showMapControls()` method in `MapControlsLayer`.
This consolidates the logic for showing system UI, ensuring it's consistently displayed whenever map controls are made visible.
Removes redundant `showSystemUI()` calls from various activities and fragments.
Also renamed and inverted `switchMapControlsAndSystemUiVisibilityNotAllowed()` to `isFullscreenModeAllowed()` for clarity.
