feat(osmedit): Auto-show keyboard for OSM note editor

Automatically requests focus and displays the soft keyboard upon opening the Send OSM Note bottom sheet, streamlining the process of adding or editing notes.

Also, refactored the anonymous inner class for the 'upload anonymously' checkbox listener into a lambda expression.
