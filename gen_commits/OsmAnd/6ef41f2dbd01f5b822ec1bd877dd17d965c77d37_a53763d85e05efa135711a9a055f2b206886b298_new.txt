refactor: Adjust menu button layout for large screens

Update menu.xml for large screens to use layout_weight for main buttons
and spacers. This replaces fixed dimensions with proportional sizing to
improve adaptability and responsiveness across various large screen sizes.
Button height was also slightly reduced.
