feat: Introduce advanced navigation simulation modes

Adds three distinct modes for navigation simulation:
- Fast Preview: Randomly varying speed for quick route overview.
- Constant Speed: Simulation at a user-defined constant speed via a slider.
- Close to Reality: Simulates speed based on road types and includes a delay at detected traffic lights.

This change introduces a `trafficLight` property to `Location` objects and adds logic to `RouteSegmentResult` to identify traffic signals, enabling realistic pauses during simulation. New UI elements and settings are included for mode and speed configuration.
