feat: Enhance auto-zoom & map animation; add GPX bearing support

Refactor and improve auto-zoom logic, particularly for 3D map rendering.
- Centralize auto-zoom calculations into `AutoZoomBySpeedHelper`.
- Implement a new auto-zoom algorithm using `MapRendererView` to account for 3D map surface, location height, and focal points.
- Enhance GPX track analysis to record and chart raw zoom, animated zoom, and interpolation offset.
- Add support for parsing and storing bearing information from GPX tracks.
- Refine map dragging and zooming animations for smoother transitions, especially with the 3D map renderer.
- Add `getFullZoom()` utility to `RotatedTileBox`.
