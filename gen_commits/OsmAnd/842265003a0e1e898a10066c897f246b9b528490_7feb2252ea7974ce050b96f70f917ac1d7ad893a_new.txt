feat: Add support for custom app favorites as announced waypoints

This change allows custom application favorites, such as Sherpafy's stage favorites,
to be included in the list of points announced by the waypoint helper during navigation.

- `StageFavorite` class now implements the `LocationPoint` interface.
- Waypoint announcement radii (short and long) are now defined by named constants.
