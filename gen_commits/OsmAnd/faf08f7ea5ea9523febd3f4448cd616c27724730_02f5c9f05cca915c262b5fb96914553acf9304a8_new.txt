feat: Improve map file status tracking and backup region rendering

- ResourceManager now stores and provides checks for backup map files.
- Added `onMapClosed` listener event to notify components when a map file is closed.
- DownloadedRegionsLayer now uses the centralized backup file check and reacts to `onMapsIndexed` and `onMapClosed` events to refresh region display.
