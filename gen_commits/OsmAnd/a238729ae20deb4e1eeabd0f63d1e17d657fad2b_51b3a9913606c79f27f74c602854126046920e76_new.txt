feat: Persist map elevation and shifted location

Introduce new settings to save and restore map's elevation/height and its corresponding shifted target location.
This enhances the map state persistence, especially for 3D map views.
MapActivity now correctly saves and retrieves these new parameters on pause/resume.
OsmandMapTileView has been updated to use this elevation data for map initialization and to capture height information during touch events.
Refactor AnimateDraggingMapThread to manage the map renderer's target state more effectively with these new elevation capabilities.
