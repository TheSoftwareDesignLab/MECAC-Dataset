refactor: Convert map markers dialog to LinearLayout

The root layout for the map markers dialog has been refactored from RelativeLayout to LinearLayout with vertical orientation. This simplifies the arrangement of the toolbar, content area, and bottom navigation. The main content FrameLayout now correctly occupies the remaining vertical space using layout_weight.
