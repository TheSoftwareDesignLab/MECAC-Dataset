refactor: Improve multi-touch zoom, rotation, and tilt handling

- Moved `calculateDeltaZoom` from `MultiTouchSupport` to `MapTileViewMultiTouchZoomListener`.
- Introduced `isZoomRotationGesture` in `MultiTouchSupport` for precise gesture type identification.
- Refined zoom/rotation activation thresholds using a multi-zone system for enhanced control.
