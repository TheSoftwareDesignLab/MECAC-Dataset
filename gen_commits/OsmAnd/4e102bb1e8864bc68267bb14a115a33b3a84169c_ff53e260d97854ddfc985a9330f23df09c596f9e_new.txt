feat: Display live location duration for active shares

Adds tracking for the creation timestamp of live location messages. This timestamp is used to calculate and display the duration a live location has been active, shown as 'Live: X:XX:XX' in the 'Live Now' tab and user list items. The live location indicator (•) is now always visible.
