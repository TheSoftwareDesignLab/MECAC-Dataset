refactor: Simplify formatStreetName 'towards' parameter

Replaced the boolean `includeTowards` parameter in `RoutingHelper.formatStreetName` with a `String towards` parameter. This simplifies the method's internal logic and provides more flexibility by directly passing the desired "towards" string or an empty string. All call sites have been updated accordingly.
