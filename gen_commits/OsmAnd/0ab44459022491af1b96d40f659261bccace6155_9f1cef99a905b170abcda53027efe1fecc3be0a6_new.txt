refactor(ui): Adjust simple map widget layouts and alignment

Moved padding to the root container in `simple_map_widget_medium.xml` and
replaced `ConstraintLayout` with `LinearLayout` for the header section.
Fine-tuned text view widths, weights, gravities, and margins for improved
text flow and icon alignment. Removed redundant padding and letter spacing
in `simple_map_widget_small.xml`. Updated how `TextView` gravity is set
programmatically in `SimpleWidget.java`.
