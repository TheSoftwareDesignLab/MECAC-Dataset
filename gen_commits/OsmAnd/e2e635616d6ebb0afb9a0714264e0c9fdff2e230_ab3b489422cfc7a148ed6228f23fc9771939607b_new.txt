feat: Apply day/night theme to dialogs and custom views

Ensures `AlertDialog`s and custom layouts used within dialogs (e.g., for editing tile sources) correctly reflect the application's current day/night mode. This is achieved by wrapping activity contexts with `ContextThemeWrapper` and using a theme-aware inflater, preventing UI inconsistencies.
