feat: Label GPX track chart points on map

Enhance GPX track details by displaying points from the chart directly on the map, each labeled with its corresponding X-axis value (distance or time). This provides better context when analyzing track data.

Refactors the internal representation of chart points from `List<WptPt>` to `Map<String, WptPt>` to include the necessary labels for display.
