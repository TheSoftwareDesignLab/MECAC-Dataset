fix: Use initial center for map zoom and rotation

The previous implementation used the multi-touch center point to determine the zoom center. This could lead to unexpected map shifts or an unstable zoom/rotation experience. By reverting to `initialCenterLatLon`, the map's center remains fixed during the gesture, providing a more stable and predictable interaction.
