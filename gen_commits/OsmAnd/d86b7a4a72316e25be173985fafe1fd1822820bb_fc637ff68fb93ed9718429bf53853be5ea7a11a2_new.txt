fix: Ensure LanesWidget visibility and recreation in special container

The LanesWidget now correctly manages its view within the dedicated special container.
- MapInfoLayer clears the special container on full widget recreation.
- LanesWidget actively adds/removes its view from the special container during visibility changes.
- Refined attachment and detachment logic for the special position ensures proper lifecycle.
