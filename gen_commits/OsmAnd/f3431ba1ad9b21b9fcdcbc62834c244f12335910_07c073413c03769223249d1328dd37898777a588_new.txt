refactor: Use view center for dashboard and context menu anchoring

Replaced `AndroidUtils.getViewLocation()` with `AndroidUtils.getCenterViewCoordinates()` for better precision. This ensures that UI elements like dashboards, context menus, and animations are anchored or initiated from the visual center of the interacted view, improving positioning and user experience.
