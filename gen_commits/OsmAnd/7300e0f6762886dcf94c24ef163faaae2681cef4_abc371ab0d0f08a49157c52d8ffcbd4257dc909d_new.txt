feat: Improve map animation precision and double-tap zoom centering

Refactors map animation logic to separate pan from zoom operations,
enhancing control and precision. Introduces state to accurately preserve
the map's target screen position during animations. This ensures that
user interactions like double-tap zoom consistently keep the activated
point centered on the screen.
