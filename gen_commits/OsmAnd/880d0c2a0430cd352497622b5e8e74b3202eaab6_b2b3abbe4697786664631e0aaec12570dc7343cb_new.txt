feat: Improve vertical next turn widget rendering and info

Correctly initialize TurnDrawable's horizontal mini state based on widget orientation.
Introduce dynamic text sizing for exit/out numbers in the TurnDrawable of vertical widgets, adapting to widget size (small, medium, large).
Add fallback logic to display a generic route part description when the specific street name is empty in vertical next turn widgets.
Include a comma in the distance sub-text for small vertical widgets if other text is present for better readability.
