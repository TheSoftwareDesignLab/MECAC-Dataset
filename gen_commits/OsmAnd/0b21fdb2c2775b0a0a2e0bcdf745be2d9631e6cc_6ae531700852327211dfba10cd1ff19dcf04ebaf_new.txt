feat: Preserve scroll position in Configure Screen

Restores the scroll position when the Configure Screen fragment is re-attached,
e.g., after changing the application mode. This prevents the view from
resetting its scroll state during updates.

- Introduce `NestedScrollView` and `currentScrollY` to save and restore scroll state.
- Refactor update methods (`updateWidgetsCard` to `setupWidgetsCard`, `fullUpdate` removed).
- Re-attach the fragment to refresh content when the application mode changes.
