feat: Adapt map UI elements to car view density

Adjusts the size and density of several map UI elements to ensure proper scaling when in car view mode.

- The map position indicator circles now dynamically scale based on `getCarViewDensity()`.
- The radius ruler's center icon is loaded with appropriate density options, derived from `CarNavigationSession` or display metrics, and reloaded if the car view status changes.
- The text labels for the radius ruler also adapt their size to the car view density.
- Extracted `initCenterIcon` for better code organization.
- Updated zoom animation check for ruler visibility using `AnimateDraggingMapThread`.
