feat: Implement collapsible list in Explore Places screen

Introduces the ability to hide and show the list of nearby places within the Explore Places fragment.
- Users can now hide the list to see more of the map content, with a "Show list" button appearing at the bottom.
- 'Show on map' and nearby item clicks now hide the list.
- Back press logic is updated to first show the list if hidden, then navigate back.
- Uses bottom slide animations for transitions.
- Also adds onDowngrade method to PlacesDatabaseHelper for database schema management.
