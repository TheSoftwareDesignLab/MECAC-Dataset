feat: Implement custom zoom controls and rework menu UI

- Introduced `OsmZoomControls` to ensure equal width for zoom in/out buttons.
- Refactored `main.xml` to use `OsmZoomControls` with a fixed width and updated ID.
- Overhauled `menu.xml` layout to a 2x2 grid using `TableLayout` for improved organization.
- Adjusted menu button dimensions and updated root layout to `FrameLayout`.
- Enabled POI rendering from zoom level 15 with a radius of 7.
