feat: Add osmand.net/map URL support for direct map navigation

This introduces a new URL scheme `osmand.net/map#zoom/lat/lon` to directly
move the map to a specified location.

The intent parsing logic has been refactored for improved clarity and
separation of concerns:
- `parseLocationIntent` was split into `parseMoveMapToLocationUrlIntent`
  (for the new `/map` URLs), `parseOpenLocationMenuUrlIntent` (for existing
  `/go?lat=lon` URLs), and `parseRedirectUrlIntent` (for existing
  `/go?url` redirects).
- Other parsing methods were renamed (e.g., `parseTileSourceUrlIntent`) to
  explicitly indicate they handle URLs.
