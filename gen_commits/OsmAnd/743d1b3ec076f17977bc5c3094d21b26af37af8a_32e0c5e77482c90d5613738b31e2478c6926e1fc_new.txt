fix: Display Brouter/Straight Line profiles correctly

Enhances the logic to correctly identify and select the appropriate routing profile for navigation modes that use BROUTER or STRAIGHT_LINE services. Previously, these services might not have had their corresponding UI elements selected correctly if 'mode.getRoutingProfile()' was null or empty. Also adds a null check for 'mode.getRoutingProfile()' before comparison.
