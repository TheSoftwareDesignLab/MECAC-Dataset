refactor: Remove NativeUtilities usage for pixel to LatLon

Replaced NativeUtilities.getLatLonFromElevatedPixel with
RotatedTileBox.getLatLonFromPixel in onTrackballEvent and scrollMap methods.
This simplifies coordinate conversion logic and removes an unnecessary
dependency on native utilities for these operations.
Imports were also reordered for better code organization.
