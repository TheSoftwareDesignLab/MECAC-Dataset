feat(i18n): Add Tamil translations for auth and location sharing

Adds new string resources for the Tamil language (`values-ta/strings.xml`).
These translations cover the Telegram authentication flow (phone number, password, authentication code) and location sharing features (set time, search, show on map) within the OsmAnd-Telegram application.
