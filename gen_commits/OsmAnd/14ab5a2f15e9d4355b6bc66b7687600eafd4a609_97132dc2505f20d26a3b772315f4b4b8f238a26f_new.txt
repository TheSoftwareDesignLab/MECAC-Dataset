feat: Persist map height across application sessions

Introduce a new 'height' property for the map view, allowing its state to be saved and restored. This ensures that the map's vertical perspective or "flat zoom" is maintained between app launches.

- Add 'height' field and accessors to RotatedTileBox.
- Implement saving and loading of 'last_known_map_height' in OsmandSettings.
- Update MapActivity to store and retrieve map height on pause/resume.
- Integrate 'setHeight' logic in OsmandMapTileView to use MapRendererView's restoreFlatZoom.
