fix: Reorder widgets to place individual ones after grouped

Previously, individual widgets (those without a group) could be interleaved
with grouped widgets in the list after duplicate group exclusion.
This change ensures that all widgets belonging to a unique group
are listed first, followed by all widgets that do not belong to any group.
This provides a more consistent and predictable ordering for display.
