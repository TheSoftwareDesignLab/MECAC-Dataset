feat: Refine multi-touch tilt and zoom gesture detection

Centralizes zoom calculation logic by moving calculateDeltaZoom and MAX_DELTA_ZOOM to MultiTouchSupport. The onZoomingOrRotating listener now receives the pre-calculated zoom delta.

Additionally, tilt mode activation has been adjusted:
- Reduced TILT_Y_THRESHOLD_PX to 10 for increased sensitivity.
- Tilt mode can now be activated if a significant zoom gesture (deltaZoom > 0.1) is detected, improving gesture interpretation.
