refactor(measurement_tool): Delegate GPX file loading

The `SelectFileBottomSheet` and `StartPlanRouteBottomSheet` now pass GPX file names to their listeners. The `MeasurementToolFragment` is now responsible for loading `GPXFile` objects from these names using a new helper, which first checks `SelectedGpxHelper` to prevent redundant file loading.

Includes minor UI adjustments:
- Updated padding, text appearance, and font weight in select file bottom sheet.
- Added letter spacing and updated font weight for "Last edited" text.
- Replaced `DividerHalfItem` with `DividerItem` in `StartPlanRouteBottomSheet`.
