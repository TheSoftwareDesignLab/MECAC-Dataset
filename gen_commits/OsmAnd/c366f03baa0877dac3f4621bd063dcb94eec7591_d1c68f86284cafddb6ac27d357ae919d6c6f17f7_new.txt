feat: Add Hungarian translations for new preferences and tips

This commit introduces a comprehensive set of Hungarian strings for various UI elements and user tips.
Key additions include:
- Localized names for new map indexes (e.g., regions, Wikipedia, voice packs).
- Strings supporting the re-worked Preferences structure, covering profile settings, rendering, appearance, monitoring, routing, global settings, and OSM login.
- Detailed user tips explaining map rotation, day/night mode, and how to improve OSM data.
- Messages related to the free version and recent changes (v0.7.0).
