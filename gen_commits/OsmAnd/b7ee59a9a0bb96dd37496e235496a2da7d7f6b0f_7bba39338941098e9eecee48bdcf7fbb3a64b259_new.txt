feat(dashboard): Wrap fragments with InterceptorFrameLayout for dismiss

Introduces InterceptorFrameLayout to manage touch events for dashboard fragments.
This wrapper ensures that horizontal swipe gestures for dismissing fragments are
properly intercepted and handled, preventing conflicts with child views that
might consume touch events.

Also adds detailed logging in GeoIntentActivity, RegionAddressRepositoryBinary,
InterceptorFrameLayout, and SwipeDismissTouchListener for improved debugging.
