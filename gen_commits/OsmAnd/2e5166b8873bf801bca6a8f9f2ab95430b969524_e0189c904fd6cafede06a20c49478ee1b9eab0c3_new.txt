feat: Add custom plugin versioning and AIDL access

- Introduced an AIDL API method `getPluginVersion` along with `CustomPluginParams` to allow external applications to query the version of installed custom plugins by ID.
- Updated `CustomOsmandPlugin` to store an integer version, which is read from and written to its JSON configuration. The base `OsmandPlugin`'s `getVersion` method now returns an `int`.
- Added a `silentImport` flag to the settings import process, enabling AIDL clients to import profiles and settings without displaying UI confirmation dialogs or installation prompts.
- Refined the `PluginsFragment` UI to prevent connected AIDL apps from appearing as separate plugin entries if they correspond to an OsmAnd plugin, avoiding duplicates.
- Ensured that plugin directories are created if they don't exist during plugin installation for better robustness.
