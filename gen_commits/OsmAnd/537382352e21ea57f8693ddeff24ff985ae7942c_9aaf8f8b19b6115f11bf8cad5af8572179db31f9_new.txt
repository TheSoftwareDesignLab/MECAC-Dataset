fix: Improve Mapillary filter UX and keyboard dismissal

Ensure the soft keyboard is consistently dismissed when interacting with Mapillary filter inputs and when exiting the Mapillary dashboard. Update Mapillary content immediately in the dashboard after applying username or date filters. Prevent the dashboard from automatically closing if a warning about an unknown Mapillary username is displayed.
