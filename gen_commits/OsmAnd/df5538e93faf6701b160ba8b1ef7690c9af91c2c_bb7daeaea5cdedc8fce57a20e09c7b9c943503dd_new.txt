refactor(RadiusRuler): Consolidate display options into a mode

This refactors the Radius Ruler widget's settings and behavior.
It replaces multiple boolean preferences (show ruler, show circles, night mode) with a single `RadiusRulerMode` enum preference. The settings UI is updated from individual switches to radio buttons for selecting the desired mode (Hide, Dark, Light). Tapping the widget now cycles through these display modes. Includes a migration update to align old preference settings with the new enum structure. The compass display is now conditionally enabled based on the selected ruler mode.
