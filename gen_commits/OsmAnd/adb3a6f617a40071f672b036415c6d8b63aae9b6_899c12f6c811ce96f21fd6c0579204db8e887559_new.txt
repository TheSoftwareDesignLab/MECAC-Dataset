feat: Introduce trash item data and utilities

Adds `TrashItem` data class and `TrashUtils` for managing deleted items.
Currently, `TrashUtils` populates items with test data. `CloudTrashFragment` is updated to use `TrashUtils` to check for existing trash history.
This commit lays the groundwork for a recycle bin feature.
