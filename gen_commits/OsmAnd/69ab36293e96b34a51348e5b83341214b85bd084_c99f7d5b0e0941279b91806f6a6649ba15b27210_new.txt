fix: Improve route point processing and loading robustness

Changed RouteSegmentResult.java to 'continue' instead of 'break' when a
location is null during bundle reading, making segment loading more robust
to incomplete data.

In RouteCalculationResult.java, added a check to 'break' early if route
segment points have invalid (0,0) tile coordinates, preventing issues with
erroneous data. A FIXME note indicates further investigation is needed.
