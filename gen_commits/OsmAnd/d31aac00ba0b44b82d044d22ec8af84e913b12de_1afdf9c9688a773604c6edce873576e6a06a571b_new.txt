feat: Introduce paginated right widgets panel

Refactor map right-side widgets to use a custom RightWidgetsPanel with ViewPager2, enabling multiple pages of widgets.

- Replaced LinearLayout for right widgets with a new RightWidgetsPanel.
- Implemented pagination for right widgets using ViewPager2 and custom adapter.
- Grouped widgets into pages based on type (e.g., distance/time, speed/altitude).
- Added dynamic panel resizing to wrap current page content and pagination dots.
- Custom border drawing implemented for the new panel.
- Removed unused `btn_inset_circle_transparent.xml` and simplified related styling.
- Added new color resources for widget panel dividers and borders.
- Updated MapInfoLayer to integrate and manage the new panel.
