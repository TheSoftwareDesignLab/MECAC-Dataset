feat: Enhance route objects with name and ref attributes

Implement mechanism to store and retrieve "name" and "ref" tags for `RouteDataObject`s using a string table.
Introduce `nameTypeRule` and `refTypeRule` in `RouteRegion` to map tag IDs.
Add `getName()` and `getRef()` methods to `RouteDataObject` for easy access.
Exclude administrative boundaries (admin_level) from multipolygon indexing.
Include `int_ref` in recognized routing text tags.
