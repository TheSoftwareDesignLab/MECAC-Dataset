feat: Animate map tilt angle changes

Introduce smooth animation for map elevation angle (tilt) adjustments.
The MyLocation button now uses this animation when changing the map tilt.
Refactor thread sleep calls into a new `sleepToRedraw` helper method.
Prevent `setLatLon` calls from prematurely stopping tilt animations.
