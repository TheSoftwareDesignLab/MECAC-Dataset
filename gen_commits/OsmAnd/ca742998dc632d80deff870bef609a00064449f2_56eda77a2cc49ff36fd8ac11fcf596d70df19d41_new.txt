feat: Differentiate profile reset and restore terminology

Conditionally uses 'Restore' instead of 'Reset' when managing custom profiles in the settings bottom sheet. This change applies to the title, description, and action button text. Adds new string resources for the 'Restore' action, improving clarity and user experience for profile management.
