feat: NavStartStop quick action uses application mode icon

The NavStartStop quick action icon now dynamically reflects the current
application mode's map icon. The paused or following navigation state
is now indicated by a slash overlay on this icon, replacing the
previously hardcoded target/start navigation icons.
