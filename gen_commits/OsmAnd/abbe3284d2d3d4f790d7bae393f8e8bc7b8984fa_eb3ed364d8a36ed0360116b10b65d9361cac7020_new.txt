refactor: Migrate GPX import bottom sheet to generic items

The GPX import bottom sheet dialog has been refactored to use the generic `MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment` item system.
This removes the dedicated `fragment_import_gpx_bottom_sheet_dialog.xml` layout. The UI is now programmatically constructed using `TitleItem`, `DescriptionItem`, `SimpleBottomSheetItem` for actions, and `DividerHalfItem`.
The description field in bottom sheet items now supports `CharSequence` for richer text formatting (e.g., `SpannableString`).
Also includes minor adjustments to divider margins for consistency.
