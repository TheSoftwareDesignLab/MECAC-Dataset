style: Improve marker date formatting and UI padding

Adjusted bottom padding for RecyclerViews in Active, Groups, and History marker fragments to prevent content from being obscured.
Refined date display for marker visited dates, removing trailing periods from month abbreviations and using single-digit days (e.g., "Jan 1" instead of "Jan. 01").
Changed "Cancel" button to "Close" in the marker direction bottom sheet dialog for better semantic clarity.
