refactor: Extract PointImageDrawable creation to PointImageUtils

Relocates static factory methods and the drawable caching mechanism from
`PointImageDrawable` to a new utility class, `PointImageUtils`.

This separates concerns, making `PointImageDrawable` responsible solely for
drawing logic, while `PointImageUtils` handles the creation and management
of point image drawables for various types (favorites, waypoints, etc.).

Also updates `@ColorInt` to `@ColorRes` in `DashBaseFragment.getColor`.
