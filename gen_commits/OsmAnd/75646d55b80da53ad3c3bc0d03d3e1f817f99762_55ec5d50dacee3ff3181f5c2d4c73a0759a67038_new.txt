refactor: Map layer touch events and context menu UI

Convert OsmandMapLayer from an interface to an abstract class, allowing
default implementations for touch event handlers.

Restructure map layer touch event handling:
- Introduce onSingleTap(PointF) for single tap gestures.
- Add onTouchEvent(MotionEvent) for handling raw motion events, enabling
  more granular UI interactions like pressed states.
- Migrate all existing map layers to extend the new abstract OsmandMapLayer
  and update their touch event methods accordingly.

Enhance ContextMenuLayer:
- Implement a new visual style using 9-patch drawables for the background.
- Add visual feedback for pressed states of the context menu.
- Refine text layout and drawing within the context menu.
