feat: Refactor Nearby Places UI and add map actions

Extract the Nearby Places UI into a new reusable card layout (`nearby_places_card.xml`).
Integrate this card as a header in the Quick Search history list.
Add "Show on Map" functionality to the Nearby Places fragment, allowing all
displayed points to be shown on the map and hiding the fragment.
Also hide the fragment when an individual nearby item is clicked.
