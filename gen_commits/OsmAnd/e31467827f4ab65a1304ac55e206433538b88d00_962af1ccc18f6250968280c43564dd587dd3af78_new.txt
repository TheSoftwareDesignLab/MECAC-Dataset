fix: Remove right padding from fav description in context menu

The fourth argument for `buildDescriptionRow` was changed from `5` to `0`, removing an unintended right padding for the favourite point's description text. This allows the description to better utilize available horizontal space.
An unnecessary empty line was also removed.
