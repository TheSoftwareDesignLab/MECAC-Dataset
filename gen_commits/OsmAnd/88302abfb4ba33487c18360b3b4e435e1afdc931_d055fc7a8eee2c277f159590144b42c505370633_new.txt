refactor: Route statistics and CO2 emission calculation

The CO2 emission calculation logic has been refactored, replacing the `Co2Computer` class with `EmissionHelper`.
`MOTOR_TYPE` is now managed as a generic routing parameter. Regional emission factors for electric vehicles (France, Germany) are introduced.
The route info header and statistic card UI have been redesigned for better clarity, incorporating uphill/downhill elevation data and refactored emission display.
General refactoring of routing parameter preference creation for improved reusability.
