feat: Conditionally fit track on map when opening details

Previously, opening track details would always call `updateInfo(false)`.
This change introduces logic to conditionally force fitting the track on the map:
- The track will be fitted if details are opened without an active map context menu.
- If a map context menu is active, the track will be fitted unless the
  context menu's point description is for a GPX point.

This prevents unnecessary map camera movements when the user is already
focused on a specific GPX point on the map via the context menu.
