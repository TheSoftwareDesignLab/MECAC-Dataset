refactor(ui): Improve preference icon button layout and theme consistency

The `preference_select_icon_button.xml` layout has been refactored:
- Wrapped the internal ImageViews within a `FrameLayout` as the primary container.
- Set the `FrameLayout` to fixed dimensions (164dp x 128dp).
- Updated inner `ImageView`s (`outlineRect`, `backgroundRect`) to use `match_parent` for dimensions, ensuring they fill the container.

Additionally, UI styles were adjusted:
- Simplified the parent of `OsmandPreferenceTheme` from `PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14.Material` to `PreferenceThemeOverlay`.
- Introduced `ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.ActionBar` to remove default padding.
