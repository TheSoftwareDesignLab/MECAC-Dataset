fix(gpx): Correct global GPX logging interval text

Introduced `save_track_interval_globally` to accurately describe the
logging interval for general position logging.

Previously, the dialog for setting the global GPX logging interval
incorrectly used the string for navigation-specific logging. This change
ensures the correct string is displayed, differentiating it from the
navigation interval setting.
