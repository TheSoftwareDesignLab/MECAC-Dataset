refactor(bottomsheet): Streamline trip recording UI and standardize layouts

Grouped related UI elements (always ask switch, interval slider) in Trip Recording bottom sheet to simplify visibility management.
Standardized paddings, margins, and icon sizes across generic bottom sheet layouts.
Added `tickColorInactive` attribute to the interval slider.
