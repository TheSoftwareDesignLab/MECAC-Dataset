fix: Correct average speed calculation unit

The `endTime - startTime` difference is in milliseconds. Previously, this value was incorrectly multiplied by 1000, leading to an inaccurate speed calculation. This commit divides by 1000 to convert milliseconds to seconds, ensuring speed is calculated correctly as meters per second.
