fix: Set current location when resuming navigation

Ensure the RoutingHelper is updated with the last known location when navigation is
resumed from a notification or quick action. This helps in correctly
re-initializing the navigation state and guidance.

Simplify the 'followingMode' check in NavigationNotification to directly
use `routingHelper.isFollowingMode()` for improved clarity.
