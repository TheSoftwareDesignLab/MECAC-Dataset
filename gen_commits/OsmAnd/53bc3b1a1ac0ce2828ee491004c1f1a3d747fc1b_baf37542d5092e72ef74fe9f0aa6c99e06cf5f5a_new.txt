feat: Implement custom map ratio for context menu zoom

Enhances map interaction by introducing a custom map ratio feature. This allows the context menu's point of interest to maintain its screen position during zoom operations (in/out), preventing the point from moving off-screen. The custom ratio is applied before zooming and automatically restored when the menu state changes or the fragment is paused.
