refactor: Centralize dashboard UI dimensions

Replaced hardcoded layout dimensions with `@dimen` resources for consistency and maintainability.
Introduced `values/sizes.xml` and `values-large/sizes.xml` to manage UI element sizes.
Removed redundant `layout_marginBottom` from various dashboard cards.
Deleted empty or unused layout files: `res/layout-large/dashboard.xml` and `res/layout/dash_fav_list.xml`.
Updated styles to reference new dimension resources.
