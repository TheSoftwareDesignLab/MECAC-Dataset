chore: Update Hungarian UI translations

This commit updates several Hungarian localization strings across
`bidforfix.xml` and `strings.xml`. Key updates include:
- Bid-for-fix related terms (loading, supporters, funded)
- Offline navigation and download descriptions
- General UI elements and descriptions
Minor formatting adjustments were also made to some empty string resources.
