feat: Enhance location sharing widget feedback with 'on' animation

Introduces a distinct animated icon for the location sharing status widget when it is actively sending updates.

- Adds new animated resources for the 'on' state (day/night).
- Updates widget logic to use the specific 'on' animation when `isSending` is true and `oldestTime` is current.
- Includes a debug log statement for the widget's state.
