feat(i18n): Add and refine Marathi translations

This commit introduces new Marathi translations for a wide range of UI strings,
including settings for transparency, online maps, GPX descriptions, support,
accessibility modes, and directional terms.

It also refines the existing Marathi translation for the default favorite
category. The English source strings for 'Left-Hand Driving' related options
were also updated within the Marathi locale file to reflect recent changes.
