fix: Stop navigation properly when an active route exists

Previously, stopping navigation via the 'Navigate to point' menu item might not have fully cancelled an active route. This change ensures that if a route is active, its final destination is explicitly cleared using `routingHelper.setFinalAndCurrentLocation`, correctly terminating navigation.
