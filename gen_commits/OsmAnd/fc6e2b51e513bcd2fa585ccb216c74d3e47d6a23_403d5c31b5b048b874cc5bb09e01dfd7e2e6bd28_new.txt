feat: Allow accessibility long-press to select objects

Enhances accessibility by enabling long-press events to first attempt to select map objects and show an object-specific context menu. If no objects are found, it falls back to a generic point context menu.

This was achieved by:
- Refactoring `ContextMenuLayer` to extract object selection logic into a new public method `selectObjectsForContextMenu`.
- Modifying `showContextMenuForSelectedObjects` to accept a LatLon parameter for improved flexibility.
- Changing a toast message from `showToastMessage` to `showShortToastMessage`.
