refactor: Standardize dimensions in measurement tool layouts

Replaced hardcoded dimension values with new `@dimen` resources across
various measurement tool and related bottom sheet dialog layouts.
This change centralizes UI spacing and sizing, improving consistency
and maintainability across different screen configurations.
