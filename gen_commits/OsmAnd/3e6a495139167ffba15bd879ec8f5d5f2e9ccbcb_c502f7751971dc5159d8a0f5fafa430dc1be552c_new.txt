feat(measurement-tool): Revamp Save Track dialog with more options

This commit significantly overhauls the 'Save as New Track' dialog within the Measurement Tool.
Users can now specify a custom file name, select a destination folder, and toggle options for a simplified track and showing the track on the map.

Key changes include:
- Introduced `collectDirs` utility methods in `Algorithms.java` for recursive directory collection.
- Added a new `BottomSheetItemWithSwitchOutlined` layout and strings for toggle options.
- Implemented `FolderListAdapter` for horizontal folder selection within the dialog.
- Refactored `SaveAsNewTrackBottomSheetDialogFragment` to support the new UI and options.
- Consolidated directory collection logic in `SelectFileBottomSheet` and `AvailableGPXFragment` to use the new `Algorithms.collectDirs` utility.
