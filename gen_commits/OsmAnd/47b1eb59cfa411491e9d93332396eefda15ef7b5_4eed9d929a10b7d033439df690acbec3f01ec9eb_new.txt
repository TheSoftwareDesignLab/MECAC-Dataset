feat: Support descriptive text for GPX links in waypoints & metadata

A new Link constructor (href: String?, text: String?) was added.
This enables parsing and storing both the URL and its associated text for:
- Waypoints (WptPt) in TravelGpx, extracted from amenity data.
- GPX file metadata in TravelObfHelper, from file extensions.
