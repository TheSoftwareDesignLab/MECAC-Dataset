refactor: Simplify radius ruler text coordinate calculation

The `drawCircle` method no longer needs to return specific points for text placement.
Text coordinates are now calculated directly in `drawRulerCircle` using the circle's radius and center.
This streamlines the rendering logic by removing redundant point tracking within `drawCircle`.
