feat: Implement map context menu actions customization

Users can now define and reorder "main actions" in the map context menu through new settings. This allows for a personalized and efficient interaction with frequently used features.

Key changes include:
- New IDs for Audio/Video/Photo note actions, making them configurable.
- Refactored logic to distinguish between main and additional actions based on user preferences.
- Enhanced settings to save and apply customized action lists.
- Improved handling of AIDL layers within menu customization.
