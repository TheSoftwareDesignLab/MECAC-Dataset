refactor: Use Drawable for favorite icons and update special point assets

Modernizes the handling and rendering of favorite point icons.
- Changes `favIcon` type from `Bitmap` to `Drawable` for greater flexibility.
- Removes the `special` flag and `specialPointColor` to simplify drawing logic.
- Introduces `getMapIconId` for consistent map icon resolution and leverages `UIUtilities` for loading.
- Updates Home and Work special point icons to new `mx_special_house` and `mx_special_building` assets.
