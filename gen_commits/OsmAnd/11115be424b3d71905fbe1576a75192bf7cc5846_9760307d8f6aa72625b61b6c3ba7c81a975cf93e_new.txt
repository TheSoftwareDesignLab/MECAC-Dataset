refactor(obd): Centralize data formatting and unit conversion

Remove OBDDataFieldType and its associated display logic, simplifying OBDDataField.
Move numeric formatting specifications directly to OBDTypeWidget entries.
Shift responsibility for unit conversion (e.g., speed, temperature, distance) and unit string retrieval to VehicleMetricsPlugin, allowing consistent application of user settings.
Update OBDTextWidget and OBDMainFragment to consume formatted values and separate units from the plugin.
Adjust device_characteristic_item.xml to display value and unit in distinct TextViews.
