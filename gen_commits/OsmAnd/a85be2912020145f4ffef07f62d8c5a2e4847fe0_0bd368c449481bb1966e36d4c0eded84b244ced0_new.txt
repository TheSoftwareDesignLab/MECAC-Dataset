fix: Avoid stopping navigation on simple DestinationReached menu dismissal

The `dismissMenu` method in `DestinationReachedMenuFragment` has been
refactored to solely pop the fragment from the back stack.

Previously, `dismissMenu` would always call `stopNavigationWithoutConfirm()`
regardless of the `restoreAppMode` parameter. This led to navigation
stopping prematurely when the menu was simply closed or dismissed
without initiating a new trip or concluding the entire route.

Now, the logic for restoring application mode and stopping navigation
is explicitly handled only by the "New Trip" button's click listener.
This ensures navigation correctly persists when the destination reached
menu is dismissed through other means (e.g., closing the menu, "Go Back",
"Search Nearby").
