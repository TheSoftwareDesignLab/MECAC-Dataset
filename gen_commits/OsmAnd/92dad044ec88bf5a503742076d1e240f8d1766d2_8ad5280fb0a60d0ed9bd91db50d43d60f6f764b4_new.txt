fix: Prevent map location shift during manual zoom

The `changeLocation` variable in the `changeZoom` method is now always initialized to `false`.
This ensures that the map's center position does not automatically shift when zooming in or out via the `changeZoom` method, providing a more stable user experience.
The previous conditional logic that could set `changeLocation` to `false` based on `AUTO_ZOOM_MAP.NONE` setting has been removed.
