fix: Refine map linking, follow mode, and animation logic

This commit refines how the map tracks the user's location, particularly
during follow mode and map animations.

Key improvements include:
- Enhanced `movingToMyLocation` state management for accurate tracking
  during animation start, completion, and when unlinking the map.
- Optimized animation durations, applying a shorter animation when already
  moving to location, and respecting the "Do not use animations" setting.
- Ensured animation callbacks (`finishAnimationCallback`) are only executed
  if the animation completes naturally, avoiding issues if interrupted.
- Improved the location marker's display logic, synchronizing its updates
  more precisely with the map's linked state and active animations to
  prevent visual discrepancies.
- Minor refactoring by removing redundant cached variables.
