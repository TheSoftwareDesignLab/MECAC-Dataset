i18n(ar): Add common UI strings and unit translations

Add a comprehensive set of common UI strings such as "update", "add", "hide", "save", "settings", "search", "enable", "select", "start", and "apply".
Include translations for various measurement units like "yard", "foot", "mile", "km", "m", "nm", and their respective speed/time derivatives.
Refine existing translations for "OK", "OsmAnd Service" (`osmand_service`), and "km/m" (`si_km_m`).
