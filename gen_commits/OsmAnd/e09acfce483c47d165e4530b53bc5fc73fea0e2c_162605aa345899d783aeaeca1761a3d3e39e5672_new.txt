feat: Add single tap toggle for map controls

Introduce a new user interaction where a single tap on the map (outside
of an active context menu) will toggle the visibility of the map HUD buttons.

This change also includes:
- Centralizing map control visibility management into `MapControlsLayer` with
  new `showMapControls`, `hideMapControls`, and `switchMapControlsVisibility` methods.
- Updating various fragments and layers (Dashboard, MapContextMenu,
  PlanRoute, MeasurementTool) to consistently use these new methods.
- Preventing map controls from being toggled during active navigation or when
  the measurement or plan route tools are active.
- Ensuring map controls are shown explicitly when returning to the map from
  certain fragments or when a location is set to show.
- Refactoring `MapContextMenu` and `ContextMenuLayer` methods to return
  booleans, indicating if an action (e.g., close, hide) was performed.
