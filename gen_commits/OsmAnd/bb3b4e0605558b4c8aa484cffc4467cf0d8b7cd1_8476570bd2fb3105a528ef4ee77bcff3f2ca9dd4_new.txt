feat(purchase): Implement detailed purchase item screen

Introduces a new screen to display comprehensive information for each in-app purchase and subscription.

Refactors the purchase UI by:
- Moving purchase-related files to a dedicated 'purchase' package.
- Introducing `PurchaseUiData` and `PurchaseUiDataUtils` for better data encapsulation.
- Replacing `InAppPurchaseCard` and `PromoPurchaseCard` with a unified `PurchaseItemCard`.
- Standardizing layout padding with `paddingHorizontal` and `paddingVertical`.
- Enhancing the display of subscription state, purchase time, and origin platform.
