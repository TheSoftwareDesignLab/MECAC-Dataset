feat: Improve weather forecast animation with download state awareness

- Refactor WeatherHelper to support multiple weak-referenced download state listeners.
- Enhance WeatherWebClient to provide granular download state (STARTED/FINISHED)
  and active request count.
- Implement animation suspension in WeatherForecastFragment during active downloads,
  resuming when all requests are complete, improving UX.
