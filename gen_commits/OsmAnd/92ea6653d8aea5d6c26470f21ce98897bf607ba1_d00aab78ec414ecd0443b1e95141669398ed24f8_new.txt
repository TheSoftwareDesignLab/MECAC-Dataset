feat(aidl): Add search location and show results to navigation

The AIDL `navigateSearch` intent now supports `AIDL_SEARCH_LAT` and `AIDL_SEARCH_LON` extras to specify the location where the search should be performed.

Additionally, a `show_search_results` URI parameter has been added. When true, the quick search dialog will be opened with the provided query and search location, allowing users to select from results instead of immediately navigating to the first search result. This also introduces `DESTINATION_SELECTION_AND_START` mode for Quick Search.
