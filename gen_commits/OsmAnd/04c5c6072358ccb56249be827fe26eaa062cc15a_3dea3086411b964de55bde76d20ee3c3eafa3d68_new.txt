feat: Allow targeted updates for individual settings

Introduces `updateSetting(String prefId)` in `BaseSettingsFragment` for more granular handling of preference changes.
Subclasses can now override this method to perform specific actions (e.g., recreating UI for theme changes) instead of always refreshing all settings.
