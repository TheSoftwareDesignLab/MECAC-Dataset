feat(purchase): Rework in-app purchase system and UI

This commit introduces a significant refactoring of the in-app purchase architecture to improve consistency and user experience.

Key changes include:
*   **Centralized Purchase Logic:** Renamed `InAppHelper` to `InAppPurchaseHelper` and moved its initialization to `AppInitializer`. It now acts as a central manager for all purchase-related operations, using an `InAppPurchaseListener` interface.
*   **Base Purchase Activity:** Introduced `OsmandInAppPurchaseActivity` to provide a common base for activities interacting with the purchase system, streamlining purchase flow handling (e.g., `onActivityResult`).
*   **UI Integration:** `MapActivity`, `DownloadActivity`, `OsmLiveActivity`, and various fragments (e.g., `ChoosePlanDialogFragment`, `LiveUpdatesFragment`, `SubscriptionFragment`) have been updated to utilize the new `InAppPurchaseHelper` and its listener pattern.
*   **Enhanced Purchase Dialog:** The "Choose Plan" dialog (`ChoosePlanDialogFragment`) was largely refactored for better presentation of features and purchase options, including the integration of loading indicators on purchase buttons.
*   **Free Version Banner:** The free version banner in `DownloadActivity` was updated to reflect the new purchase system's state and pricing.
*   **UI/String Refinements:** Minor layout adjustments, a new progress bar component for purchase buttons, and updated strings (e.g., "Contour lines & Hillshade maps") for clarity.
