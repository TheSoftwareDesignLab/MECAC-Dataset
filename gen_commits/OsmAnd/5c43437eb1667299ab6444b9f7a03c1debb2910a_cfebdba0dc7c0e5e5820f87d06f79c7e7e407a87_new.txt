feat: Standardize fuel consumption units and average time for OBD

Introduce `defaultAverageTime` for `OBDTypeWidget` to define a consistent
average time (5 minutes) for fuel consumption metrics.
Update UI strings across multiple languages to display fuel consumption
in L/100km instead of L/km for consistency.
Ensure all related fuel consumption widgets correctly apply this `defaultAverageTime`
and update unit formatting in `VehicleMetricsPlugin`.
Add the L/100km fuel consumption widget to the OBD main fragment.
