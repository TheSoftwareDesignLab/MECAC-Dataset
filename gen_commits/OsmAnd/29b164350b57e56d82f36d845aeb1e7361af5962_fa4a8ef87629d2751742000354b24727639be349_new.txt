refactor: Modularize bottom sheet layouts and items

Introduces generic layouts for bottom sheet descriptions and items with
right-aligned descriptions. Creates `DescriptionItem` and `TitleItem`
classes, and refactors base item classes (`BaseBottomSheetItem`,
`SimpleBottomSheetItem`, `BottomSheetItemWithDescription`) for better
extensibility.

Applies this modular approach to `ExportOptionsBottomSheetDialogFragment`
by replacing its monolithic layout with dynamically added item objects,
improving reusability and simplifying UI management.
