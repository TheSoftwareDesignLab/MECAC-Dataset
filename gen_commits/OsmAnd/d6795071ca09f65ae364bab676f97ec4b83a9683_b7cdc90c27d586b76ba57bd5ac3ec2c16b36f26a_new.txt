feat: Add undo for widget page deletion with Snackbar

Refactor `ReorderWidgetsAdapter` logic by extracting widget reordering and page management into `ReorderWidgetsAdapterHelper`.
This change enables displaying a Snackbar with an "Undo" action when a widget page is deleted, allowing users to restore the page.
Moved page order calculation methods to `WidgetsDataHolder`.
