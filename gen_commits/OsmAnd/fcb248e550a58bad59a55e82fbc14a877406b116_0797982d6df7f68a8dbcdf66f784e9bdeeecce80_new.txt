refactor: Adjust map drag animation sequence and zoom precision

Reorders animatingRotateInThread, animatingMoveInThread, and animatingZoomInThread calls.
Ensures rotation and movement animations are handled before the final zoom.
Explicitly sets the final fractional zoom part to 0 during zoom animation.
Adds pendingRotateAnimation() for improved rotation management.
