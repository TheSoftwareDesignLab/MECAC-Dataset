refactor: Encapsulate preferences in Audio/Video Notes and Parking plugins

Move plugin-specific preferences from direct OsmandSettings access to be
managed directly within their respective plugin classes.

- AudioVideoNotesPlugin now declares its audio/video recording and display
  preferences as internal fields.
- ParkingPositionPlugin now declares all parking-related preferences as
  internal fields and provides dedicated getter/setter methods for their
  management.
- ParkingPositionLayer is updated to retrieve parking data directly from
  ParkingPositionPlugin.

This improves encapsulation, modularity, and reduces direct dependencies on
the global settings object for plugin-specific configurations.
