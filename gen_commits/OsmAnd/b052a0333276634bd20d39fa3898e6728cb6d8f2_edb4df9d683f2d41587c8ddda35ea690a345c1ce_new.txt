fix: Improve button layout stability with simplified algorithm

Renamed ALTERNATIVE_ALGORITHM to SIMPLIFIED_ALGORITHM for clarity.
Implemented a revised forward iteration algorithm for button positioning, which
checks against previously positioned buttons. This approach aims to provide
more stable and consistent layouts, especially in scenarios where the
original algorithm might lead to "broken" states.
Enabled debug printing for further analysis.
