refactor: Standardize UI dimensions and button drawables

- Rename button drawables for simpler naming (e.g., `btn_border_rounded_dark.xml` to `btn_rounded_dark.xml`).
- Replace hardcoded `dp` values with dimension resources for button radii, icon sizes, and layout heights.
- Improve consistency in button background colors and refactor icon handling logic.
