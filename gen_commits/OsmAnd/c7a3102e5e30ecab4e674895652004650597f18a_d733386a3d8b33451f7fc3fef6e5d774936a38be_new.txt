feat: Allow plugins to influence destination reached actions

The `OsmandPlugin.onDestinationReached()` method now returns a boolean, allowing plugins to indicate whether the main route clearing and application mode reset should proceed.

The `RoutingHelper` now conditionally clears the route based on this boolean result. The `RoutePointsPlugin` utilizes this by returning `false` if it successfully navigates to the next point in a multi-point route, preventing the main routing state from being prematurely reset.

Additionally, the `RoutePointsPlugin` is now enabled by default during plugin initialization when inlined.
