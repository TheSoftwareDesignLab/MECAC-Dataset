feat: Enhance auto-zoom and introduce zoom level charting

Move auto-zoom calculation logic to `AutoZoomBySpeedUtils` for better modularity.
Introduce a new `zoom` attribute for GPX track points, enabling the visualization of map zoom levels over time.
Add "Animated zoom" and "Non-animated zoom" chart types to display zoom data in GPX charts.
Refactor `GpxMarkerView` and `OrderedLineDataSet` to support up to two chart datasets with custom value formatters and improved layout.
Update plugin API to use `TrackPointsAnalyser` for GPX point analysis.
