feat: Add select all/deselect all functionality for OSM edits

Introduces "Select All" and "Deselect All" options within the action mode
for OSM edits (points and bugs). This allows users to easily select or
deselect all pending edits for bulk upload or deletion.

Also includes minor UI adjustments:
- Sets `layout_marginRight` to 0dp for a button in `dash_parking_fragment.xml`.
- Ensures `note.xml` list items have a `minHeight` for consistent display.
