feat: Improve amenity icon resolution

Introduced a context-aware method `getIconNameForAmenity(Context, Amenity)` that prioritizes `osmandPoiKey` for more accurate icon matching.
Updated `POIMapLayer` and `POITileProvider` to use this new method for displaying POI icons.

Optimized online places data fetching by reducing the zoom level by 3 (instead of 1) when the maximum tile limit is exceeded, speeding up loading for large query areas.
