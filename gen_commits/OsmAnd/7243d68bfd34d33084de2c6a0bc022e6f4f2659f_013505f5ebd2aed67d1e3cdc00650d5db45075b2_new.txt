fix: Prevent road shield overflow in next turn widget

Dynamically hides road shields that exceed available width within the next turn widget. This ensures proper layout, especially for small vertical widgets.

- Introduced `checkShieldOverflow()` to measure and hide overflowing shields.
- Refactored `setRoadShield()` to trigger the overflow check and manage shield container visibility.
