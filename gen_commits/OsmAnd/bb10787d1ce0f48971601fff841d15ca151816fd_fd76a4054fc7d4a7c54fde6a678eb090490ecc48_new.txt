feat: Improve Wikivoyage article hierarchy navigation

Introduces the `IS_PARENT_OF` tag to explicitly define direct parent-child relationships between Wikivoyage articles. The article navigation map generation now utilizes this tag, replacing the previous implicit `IS_PART` based approach. Article display and selection logic has been updated to use article titles instead of `TravelArticleIdentifier` for consistency.
