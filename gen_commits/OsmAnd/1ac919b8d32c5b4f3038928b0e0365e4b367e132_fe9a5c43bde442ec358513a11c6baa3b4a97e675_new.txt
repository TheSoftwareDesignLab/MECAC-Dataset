fix: Improve RTL layout support for UI elements

Introduced new `_rounded_left` drawable resources to provide correct visual treatment for UI elements (e.g., buttons) in RTL layouts.
Dynamically applies these drawables in `BooleanPreferenceBottomSheet` based on layout direction.
Ensured proper icon orientation by applying `UiUtilities.rotateImageByLayoutDirection` to relevant icons (e.g., close buttons, secondary options) within `ContextMenuAdapter` and `LiveUpdatesFragment` for consistent display in RTL.
