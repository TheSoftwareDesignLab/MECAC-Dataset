refactor: Consolidate quick action show/hide UI strings

Removed redundant "Show/hide" strings for quick actions across all localizations.
Quick action display names are now programmatically constructed using a generic "Show" or "Hide" prefix combined with the feature name, simplifying localization and ensuring consistent naming for toggle-based actions.
