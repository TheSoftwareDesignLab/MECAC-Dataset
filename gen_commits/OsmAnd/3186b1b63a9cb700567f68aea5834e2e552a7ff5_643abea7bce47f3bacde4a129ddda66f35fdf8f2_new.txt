fix: Dynamically size measurement tool bottom sheets

Introduces ScrollViews to the measurement tool's options, selected point, and snap-to-road bottom sheets. Implements dynamic height calculation to prevent content from overflowing the screen, ensuring all options are accessible across different screen sizes and orientations. Also includes minor layout weight adjustments for the measurement tool fragment in landscape mode for better UI balance.
