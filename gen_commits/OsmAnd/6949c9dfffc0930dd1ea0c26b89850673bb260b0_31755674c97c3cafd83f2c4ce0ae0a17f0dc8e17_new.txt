fix: Side panel width and widget icon/text display

Limit side widgets panel width to 45% of the screen to prevent excessive space usage on wide displays.
Ensure simple widget icons are always visible when configured, removing previous size/orientation conditions.
Apply consistent text styling and boldness to horizontal widgets.
