feat: Enhance multi-touch zoom/rotate centering

Improves the multi-touch zoom and rotation experience by ensuring
that the map content initially under the pinch center remains
in place throughout the gesture.

The previous centering logic during gestures could result in slight
drifts. This change stores the initial map tile under the pinch
center and actively re-centers the map to keep this tile under
the current pinch center while scaling and rotating.

Also fixes a Y-coordinate inversion when getting the map location
from a screen point during multi-touch start.
