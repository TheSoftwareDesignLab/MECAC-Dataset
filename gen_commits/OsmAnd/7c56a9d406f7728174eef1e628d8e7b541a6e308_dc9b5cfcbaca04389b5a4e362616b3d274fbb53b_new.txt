fix: Enhance auto-zoom's handling of active turns

Refine the logic for `nextTurnInFocus` within `getShowDistanceToDrive`.
- Prioritize using the distance of the currently focused turn for zoom calculation.
- Explicitly clear `nextTurnInFocus` when a turn is no longer active or no next turn is available.
This ensures more consistent and stable auto-zoom behavior when approaching and navigating turns.
