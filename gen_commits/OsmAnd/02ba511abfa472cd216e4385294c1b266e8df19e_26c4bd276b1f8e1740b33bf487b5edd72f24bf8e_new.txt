- Introduced a NauticalBridgeHeightWarningCard to alert users about vessel height limitations in boat routing mode.
- Added new string resources for vessel height and width descriptions and warnings.
- Updated VehicleParameters settings to include distinct icons and descriptions for boat-specific height and width parameters, differentiating them from general vehicle parameters.
- The warning card provides a direct link to the relevant settings for adjustment.
