fix: MapContextMenu: Guard updates and improve layout height checks

The `updateMenu()` method now executes only after the fragment's view (`onCreateView`) has been fully created, preventing potential premature updates or crashes.
Additionally, negative height calculations for title, download, and progress containers are explicitly handled to ensure layout stability.
