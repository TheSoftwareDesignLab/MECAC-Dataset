fix: updateModeButton saves and applies application mode

The `updateModeButton` method now explicitly sets the selected application mode in user settings and triggers a full settings refresh. This ensures the chosen mode is persisted and correctly applied across the application.
The initial call to `updateModeButton` in `onCreate` was removed as it is no longer necessary.
