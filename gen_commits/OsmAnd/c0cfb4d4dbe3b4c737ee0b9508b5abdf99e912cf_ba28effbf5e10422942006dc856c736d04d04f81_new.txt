feat(ka): Translate many UI strings to Georgian

Added Georgian translations for numerous user interface strings previously displayed in English.
This update covers descriptions for speed cameras, speed limits, toll road avoidance, map widget labels (e.g., street name, configuration, compass, speed, altitude), and background service settings (e.g., screen lock, sleep mode).
Includes a minor correction for an existing Georgian string and an updated translation for the 0.8.2 release notes.
