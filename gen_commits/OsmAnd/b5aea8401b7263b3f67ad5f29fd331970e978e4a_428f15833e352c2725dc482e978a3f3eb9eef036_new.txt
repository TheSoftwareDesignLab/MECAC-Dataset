refactor: Make ImportHelper a singleton managed by OsmandApplication

Moved ImportHelper instantiation to OsmandApplication and AppInitializer.
Activities and fragments now retrieve ImportHelper from OsmandApplication.
Introduced `setUiActivity` and `resetUIActivity` to manage the active UI context.
Extracted ImportType, GpxImportListener, and OnSuccessfulGpxImport into separate files.
Implemented ImportTaskCallback and BaseImportAsyncTask for standardized post-import notifications.
