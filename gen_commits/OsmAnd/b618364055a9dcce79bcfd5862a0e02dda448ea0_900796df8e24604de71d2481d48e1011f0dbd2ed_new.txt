feat: Enhance landscape coordinate keyboard item spacing

Adjusts `layout_weight` for `coordinate_input_keyboard_item.xml` in landscape mode.
Increases the vertical space for the keyboard item text (from 0.3 to 0.5) and reduces top/bottom spacing (from 0.35 to 0.25).
This change makes the key labels more prominent and easier to interact with.
