refactor: Remove redundant layout_gravity in storage dialog TextViews

The `android:layout_gravity="fill_horizontal"` attribute was removed from multiple TextViews (e.g., `deviceMemoryTitle`, `sharedMemoryTitle`) in the data storage place dialog. This attribute was redundant as these TextViews already specify `android:layout_width="wrap_content"`, which dictates their width.
