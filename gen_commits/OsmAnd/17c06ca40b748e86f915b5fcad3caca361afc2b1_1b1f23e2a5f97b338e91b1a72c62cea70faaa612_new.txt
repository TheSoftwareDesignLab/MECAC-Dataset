feat: Implement paged widget panel reordering

Introduces the ability to organize map widgets into multiple pages within a panel,
starting with the right-hand widget panel. Users can now:
- Add new widget pages.
- Reorder widgets across different pages via drag-and-drop.
- Delete existing pages (moving widgets to the previous page).

This involved:
- New layouts for "add page" and reorderable page items.
- Updating widget preference storage in OsmandSettings to support page separators.
- Modifying MapWidgetInfo and related classes to track widget page indices.
- Major refactoring of the ReorderWidgetsAdapter and WidgetsDataHolder to manage
  page creation, deletion, and widget movement between pages.
