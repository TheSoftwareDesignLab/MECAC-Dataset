feat: Revamp map widget reordering experience

The map widget reordering functionality in the Configure Screen has been significantly refactored and improved.
- Replaced outdated `WidgetItem` and `DataHolder` with a new `WidgetsDataHolder` and enhanced `MapWidgetInfo` to manage widget data.
- Centralized widget order persistence in `WidgetsPanel` with the new `setWidgetsOrder` method.
- Updated `MapWidgetRegistry` and related fragments to use the new widget management system, moving away from `ContextMenuAdapter` based configurations.
- Improved icon rendering and active state handling in `WidgetViewHolder`.
- Also refactored the `ResetProfilePrefsBottomSheet.showInstance` method signature, removing the `prefId` parameter and reordering existing arguments, with corresponding updates across all calling sites.
