feat: Make width card top divider dynamic based on coloring

When a route info attribute (e.g., speed, altitude) is selected for route/track coloring, the top divider of the corresponding width card is now hidden. This enhances UI clarity by removing unnecessary visual elements.
Also, refactored `RouteLineColorCard`'s `modeChanged` logic for better readability and conciseness.
Added `final` modifiers to fields and `NonNull`/`Nullable` annotations.
