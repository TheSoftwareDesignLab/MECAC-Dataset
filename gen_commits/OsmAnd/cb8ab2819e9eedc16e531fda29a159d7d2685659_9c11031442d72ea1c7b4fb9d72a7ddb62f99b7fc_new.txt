refactor: Split TurnDrawable color update methods

The `TurnDrawable.updateColors` method has been refactored into two distinct methods for clearer responsibility:
*   `updateTextPaint(@NonNull TextPaint textPaint, boolean nightMode)`: Exclusively updates text-related paint properties.
*   `updateColors(boolean nightMode)`: Exclusively updates the drawable's background and stroke colors based on night mode.

Additionally, the redundant `mini` parameter was removed from the `TurnPathHelper.calcTurnPath` call within `TurnDrawable.setTurnType`. The `NextTurnBaseWidget` has been updated to correctly utilize these new methods.
