feat: Introduce configurable modes for Trip Recording Distance widget

The Trip Recording Distance widget now supports displaying different distance metrics.
Users can switch between 'Total Distance', 'Last Uphill', and 'Last Downhill' modes.
- 'Total Distance' shows the overall recorded distance.
- 'Last Uphill' shows the distance of the most recent uphill segment.
- 'Last Downhill' shows the distance of the most recent downhill segment.

A new `TripRecordingDistanceInfoFragment` has been added for mode selection, and `TripRecordingDistanceWidgetState` manages these settings per application profile. The widget dynamically updates its value and icon based on the active mode.
