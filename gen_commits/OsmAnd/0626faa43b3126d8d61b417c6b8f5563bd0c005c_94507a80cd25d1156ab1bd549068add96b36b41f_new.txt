refactor: Streamline default settings and widget visibility

Adjust several default preferences and widget availabilities for improved consistency.

- Enable snap to road for pedestrian mode by default.
- Set map rotation to bearing for pedestrian mode by default.
- Simplify default 3D map mode visibility to 'VISIBLE'.
- Consolidate transparent map theme default to false, removing per-mode overrides.
- Show 'Second Next Turn' widget for pedestrian mode.
