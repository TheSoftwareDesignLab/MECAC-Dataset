refactor: Adjust default preferences and fix routing logic

- Adjusted `isProfileDependent` flag and explicitly set mode-specific defaults for `SAVE_TRACK_TO_GPX` and `SAVE_TRACK_INTERVAL`.
- `SHOW_ALTITUDE_INFO` now defaults to disabled globally but is enabled for BICYCLE and PEDESTRIAN modes.
- Moved "Monitor settings" preference group to "Profile Dependent Settings" category.
- Fixed `newRoute` determination in `RoutingHelper` to check the current route status, preventing incorrect recalculation prompts.
- Refined distance check in `MapInfoLayer` from `d != 0` to `d > 0`.
