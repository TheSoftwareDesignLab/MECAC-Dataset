refactor: Dedicate methods for Sherpafy tour details views

Replaces generic `showHtmlFragment` calls with `showDetailedOverview` and
`showDetailedInstructions` for semantic clarity. Introduces new UI states
(`STATE_DETAILED_INSTRUCTIONS`, `STATE_DETAILED_OVERVIEW`) and updates
navigation logic to handle these specific detailed views.
The original `showHtmlFragment` is now a private helper.
