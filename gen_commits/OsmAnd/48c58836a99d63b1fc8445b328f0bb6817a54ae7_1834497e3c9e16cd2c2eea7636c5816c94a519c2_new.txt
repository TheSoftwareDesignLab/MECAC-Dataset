feat: Migrate track options to system menu and add long press selection

- Replaced custom popup menus with `androidx.appcompat.widget.PopupMenu` for track folder and item options, providing a native look and feel.
- Implemented long-press actions on track items and groups to directly access the track selection mode.
- Centralized track selection logic into a dedicated `showTracksSelection` helper method.
- Updated accessibility content description for the overflow menu icon.
