refactor(bot): Standardize units in Telegram location messages

OsmandFormatter functions now support generating formatted distance, altitude, and speed strings with non-localized units. This is leveraged to ensure that all text messages sent by the OsmAnd Telegram bot for location sharing use consistent, non-localized units (e.g., "m", "m/s", "km") regardless of the app's current locale.

This improves the clarity and universal understanding of location data shared via text messages. The logic for constructing these messages has also been centralized into OsmandLocationUtils.getTextMessageContent, simplifying the TelegramHelper.
