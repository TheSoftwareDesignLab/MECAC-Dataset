fix: Translate osmand_ prefixed POI types correctly

Adds a fallback to strip the "osmand_" prefix when looking up POI types if a direct match is not found. This ensures that types like "osmand_amenity_restaurant" are correctly identified and translated even if the `PoiType` is defined without the "osmand_" prefix.
