refactor: Isolate Android Auto navigation logic

Moved Android Auto specific navigation functionality from NavigationService
into NavigationSession to improve separation of concerns.

- NavigationService now focuses on general navigation and GPX tracking.
- NavigationSession manages its own lifecycle, CarContext, location updates,
  and trip updates via NavigationManager callbacks.
- Android Auto foreground service notification is now handled
  directly by NavigationCarAppService.
