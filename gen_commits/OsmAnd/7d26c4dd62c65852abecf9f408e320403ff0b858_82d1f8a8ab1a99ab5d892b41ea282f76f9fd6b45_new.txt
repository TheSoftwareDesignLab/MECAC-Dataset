refactor: Smoothen auto-zoom transitions and use ComplexZoom

Introduces a `ComplexZoom` class to handle zoom levels with base and fractional parts.
Adds `smoothenAutoZoom` to dynamically calculate animation duration, providing
a smoother transition for auto-zoom changes, especially when integrated with
`MapRendererView`.
