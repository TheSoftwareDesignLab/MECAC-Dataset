refactor: Remove custom AccessibleToast implementation

Removes the custom `AccessibleToast` class and its supporting files, including `notification.xml`, `NotificationTextView.java`, and `TextMessage.java`.
All existing calls to `AccessibleToast.makeText` have been replaced with the standard `Toast.makeText`.
This change simplifies the codebase by relying on the default Android Toast implementation for all toast messages.
