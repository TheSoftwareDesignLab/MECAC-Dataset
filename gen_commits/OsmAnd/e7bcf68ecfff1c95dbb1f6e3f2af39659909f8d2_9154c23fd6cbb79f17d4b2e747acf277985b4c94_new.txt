fix(navigation): Improve compass stability during low speed map rotation

Activates the compass for map rotation when the device's speed is very low (< 0.5 m/s)
or unavailable, even if a bearing is technically present.
This prevents erratic map rotation caused by unreliable GPS bearing data at low speeds,
improving map stability in "Rotate map by bearing" mode during navigation.

Also removes an unused OlsonTimeZone import.
