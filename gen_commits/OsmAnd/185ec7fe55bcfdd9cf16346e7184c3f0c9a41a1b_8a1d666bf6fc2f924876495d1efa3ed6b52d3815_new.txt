feat: Implement profile color and icon selection UI

Introduce dedicated UI for selecting profile colors and icons within the Profile Appearance settings.
- Add `preference_circle_item.xml` and `preference_color_select.xml` layouts for displaying color/icon options.
- Update `ProfileAppearanceFragment` to dynamically render and manage color/icon choices, reflecting selections in the toolbar profile preview.
- Rename `profile_appeariance.xml` to `profile_appearance.xml` (typo fix).
- Refactor cancel/save buttons in `preference_cancel_save_button.xml` to use Material AlertDialog style and adjust dimensions.
- Simplify `circle_contour_bg_light.xml` drawable.
