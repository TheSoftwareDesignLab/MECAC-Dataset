feat: Redesign map rendering and appearance settings UI

Moves map rendering and appearance settings from the traditional Android
preference screen to dynamic on-map controls. Introduces interactive
widgets for map text size, ruler visibility, position on map, rendering
style, and custom rendering attributes directly on the map view.
Refactors custom rendering property storage and application.
