feat: Improve Wikipedia POI source UI with new list item layout

Introduce `list_item_with_selector.xml` for reusable menu item displays.
Apply this new layout to the Wikipedia POI source selection, adding a secondary arrow icon for better user experience.
Refactor `R.string.data_source` to `R.string.poi_source` for clarity.
Update wording for status messages (e.g., "Enabled" to "On", "Online" to "Online only").
