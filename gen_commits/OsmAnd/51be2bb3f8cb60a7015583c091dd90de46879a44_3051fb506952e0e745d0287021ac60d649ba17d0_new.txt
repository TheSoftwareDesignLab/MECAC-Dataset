feat: Public transport details: add boarding time, refine fragment mgmt

Introduces boarding time as a distinct parameter in public transport route
calculations and display within the route details screen. This replaces
previous implicit handling with explicit `boardingTime` for segment timing.

Also, enhances the `ChooseRouteFragment` to allow setting an `initialMenuState`
when opening route details, providing more control over the UI presentation.

Refactors `RouteDetailsFragment` retrieval logic to use `routeId` for better
fragment management within the `ViewPager`.
