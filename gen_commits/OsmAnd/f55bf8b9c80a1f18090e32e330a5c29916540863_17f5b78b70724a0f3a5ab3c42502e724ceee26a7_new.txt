feat: Increase weather forecast animation duration to 6 hours

The weather forecast animation now covers a 6-hour period, up from the previous 3 hours. A new constant, `FORECAST_ANIMATION_DURATION_HOURS`, was introduced to manage this duration.
Additionally, the default initial time for the forecast slider on future dates has been adjusted from 12 PM to 9 AM.
