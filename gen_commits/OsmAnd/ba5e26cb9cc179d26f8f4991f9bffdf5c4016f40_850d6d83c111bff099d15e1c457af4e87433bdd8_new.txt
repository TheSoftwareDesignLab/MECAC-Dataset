feat: Streamline routing and options in measurement tool

Removed the 'Snap Track Warning' dialog, providing direct access to routing options.
The 'Get Directions' and 'Reverse Route' actions have been removed from the measurement tool's options menu.
Includes a null-safety check for `getTrkSegment()` in `isSnapToRoadTrack()`.
