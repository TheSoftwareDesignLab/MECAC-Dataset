feat: Add setting to show persistent zoom buttons in navigation

Introduces a new option in Navigation settings to control the visibility of zoom buttons during active navigation.

- When enabled, dedicated zoom buttons are displayed persistently on the right side of the map.
- When disabled (default), standard zoom and menu controls are hidden by default during navigation, appearing temporarily on map interaction.
- Refactors the navigation countdown mechanism to stop on any interaction with map controls.
