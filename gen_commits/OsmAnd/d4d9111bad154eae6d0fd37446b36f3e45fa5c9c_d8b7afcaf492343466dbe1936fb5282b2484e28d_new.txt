- Enhance RenderingClass to support detailed metadata including descriptions, categories, and inner class definitions.
- Update RenderingRulesStorage to parse nested rendering classes, merge attributes from dependencies, and dynamically create sub-classes from `inner-names`.
- Refactor map route configuration fragments to use the new RenderingClass hierarchy.
- Introduce RenderingClassFragment and a revamped RenderingClassesCard for detailed, interactive configuration of rendering classes and their children.
- Integrate RENDERING_CLASS dashboard type for improved navigation and management of map styles.
