feat: Auto-reconnect external sensors on disconnect

Introduces a mechanism to automatically attempt reconnection when an external sensor disconnects unexpectedly.
A scheduled executor manages reconnection attempts with a delay and a timeout. If a reconnection fails, a toast message is displayed.
Plugin lifecycle methods (init/disable) now properly manage the reconnection scheduler.
Also allows manual reconnection from the sensor widget.
