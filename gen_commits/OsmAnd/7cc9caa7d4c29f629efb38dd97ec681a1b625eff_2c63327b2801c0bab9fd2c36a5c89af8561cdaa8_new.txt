feat: Add support for route text tags and ferry routing

- Extracts and stores specific text tags (`ref`, `name`, `direction`, `duration`) for routes.
- Integrates `route=ferry` across map generation, rendering, and routing.
- Prevents null values for routing rule tags during protobuf serialization.
- Adds dedicated tracking for route string data size.
