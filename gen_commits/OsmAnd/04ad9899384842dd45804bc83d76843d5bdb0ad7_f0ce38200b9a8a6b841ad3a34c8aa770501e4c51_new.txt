feat: Add left side navigation preference

Introduce a new setting for users in left-hand traffic countries to
configure navigation behaviour accordingly.

Temporarily disable OsmAnd offline navigation service as it is not
yet available. A toast message will now inform the user, and routing
will fall back to CloudMade in these cases.
