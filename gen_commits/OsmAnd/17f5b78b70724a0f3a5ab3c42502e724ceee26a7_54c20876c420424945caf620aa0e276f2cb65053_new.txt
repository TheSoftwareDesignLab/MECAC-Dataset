feat(weather): Enhance forecast animation to use 3-hour window

The weather forecast animation now plays for a fixed 3-hour period.
The animation's start time is precisely determined from the user's selected time on the slider, rather than the start of the day.
Animation correctly stops after the 3-hour window has elapsed.
