feat: Add system accessibility settings shortcut

Adds a preference in Accessibility Settings to link to the system's Accessibility settings.
This preference is shown when OsmAnd's accessibility mode is 'Default' and system accessibility is currently disabled, guiding users to enable necessary system features.
Includes refactoring of the `preference_permission.xml` layout and custom styling for the new preference entry.
