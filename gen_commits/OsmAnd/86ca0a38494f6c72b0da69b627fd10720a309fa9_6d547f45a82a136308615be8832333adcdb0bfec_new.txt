feat: Allow external apps to add items to navigation drawer

Introduces a new AIDL API method `addOpenAppNavDrawerItem` that enables external applications to add a custom entry to OsmAnd's main navigation drawer.

The method accepts the item's display name, the target application package, and optional intent flags. These details are stored in OsmAnd's settings. When the drawer item is selected, it launches the specified external application.

The OsmAnd-telegram client has been updated to utilize this new API to integrate itself into the OsmAnd navigation drawer.
