refactor: Update headliner assets and refine layout margins

Refreshed various `headliner` and `close_button` image assets.
Consolidated landscape-specific drawable resources by removing redundant `drawable-land` and `drawable-large-land` assets.
Adjusted `layout_marginLeft`, `layout_marginRight`, and `layout_marginTop` for headline elements across different `menu.xml` layouts to improve visual alignment.
Standardized `layout_marginTop` from `px` to `dp` in the default `menu.xml`.
