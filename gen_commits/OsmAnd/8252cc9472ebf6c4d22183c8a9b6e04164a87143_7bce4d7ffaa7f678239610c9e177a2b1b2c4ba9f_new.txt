refactor: Consolidate profile & icon selection dialogs

- Merged `ProfileBottomSheetDialogFragment` and `SelectIconBottomSheetDialogFragment` into `SelectProfileBottomSheetDialogFragment` for a unified selection experience.
- Standardized bottom sheet item height and padding, and updated divider style.
- Renamed "Routing Type" to "Navigation type" in relevant strings for improved clarity.
- Introduced a confirmation dialog for discarding unsaved profile changes during editing.
- Ensured the default application mode is set upon profile deletion.
- Refined routing profile description to display the source filename for custom profiles.
- Improved `getRoutingConfig()` initialization logic and encapsulated `routingConfig`.
