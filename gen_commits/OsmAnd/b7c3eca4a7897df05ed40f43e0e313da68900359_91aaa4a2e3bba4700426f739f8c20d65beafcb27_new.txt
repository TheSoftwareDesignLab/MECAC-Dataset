feat: Measure distance from single touch to current location

Introduces the ability to measure the distance from a point on the map,
indicated by a single finger touch, to the user's current GPS location.

- Activated by touching and holding a finger on the map.
- The distance is displayed visually on the map with a connecting line
  and in the ruler information widget.
- Updates `RulerControlLayer` to handle single touch events, draw the
  distance, and manage state.
- `MapInfoWidgetsFactory` is updated to display this new distance value.
