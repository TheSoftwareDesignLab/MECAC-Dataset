Scale images within tour descriptions to fit the screen width, preventing overflow.
Introduce an `onResume` check to re-index tour data and return to tour selection if necessary after completing a download, ensuring newly downloaded tours are immediately available.
Temporarily disabled a generic toast message in `OsmandApplication`.
