feat: Support map widgets from connected AIDL apps

Refactor widget creation flow to allow connected AIDL applications to provide custom map widgets.
Introduces new delegation methods (`askCreateExternalWidget`, `askCreateWidgetInfo`) in `OsmandAidlApi` and `ConnectedApp` to dynamically query and create external widgets and their info.
The `WidgetType.getById` method now recognizes AIDL-prefixed widget IDs, enabling `MapWidgetsFactory` and `WidgetInfoCreator` to properly handle these external widgets within the UI.
