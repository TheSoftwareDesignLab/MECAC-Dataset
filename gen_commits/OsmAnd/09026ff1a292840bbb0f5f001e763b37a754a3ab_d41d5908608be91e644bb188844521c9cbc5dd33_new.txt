feat: Preserve fractional zoom when setting main layer

The fractional zoom part (floatZoomPart) is now preserved from the current viewport
when the main map layer is set. Previously, it was implicitly reset to 0.
If the integer zoom level needs to be clamped to the layer's min/max zoom,
the fractional part is explicitly reset to 0 to ensure a consistent state.
