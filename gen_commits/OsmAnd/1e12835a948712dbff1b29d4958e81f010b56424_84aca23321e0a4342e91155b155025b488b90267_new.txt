feat: Use snapped mode for navigation from markers

When initiating navigation directly from the Plan Route markers fragment,
the application mode (e.g., car, bicycle) determined by the snapped route
in that context will now be applied. Previously, the default user's
application mode might have been used, overriding the intended mode from
the planned route.
