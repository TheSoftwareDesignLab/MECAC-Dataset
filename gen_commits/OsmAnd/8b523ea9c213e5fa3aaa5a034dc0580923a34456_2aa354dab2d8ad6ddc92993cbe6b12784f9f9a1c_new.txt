feat: Redesign Notes list for landscape orientation

Groups notes list items into visually distinct cards, each starting with a header, to
better utilize screen space on wider displays. The traditional list view
is retained for portrait orientation. Also makes the list footer portrait-only
and adds IDs to header layout elements for programmatic access.
