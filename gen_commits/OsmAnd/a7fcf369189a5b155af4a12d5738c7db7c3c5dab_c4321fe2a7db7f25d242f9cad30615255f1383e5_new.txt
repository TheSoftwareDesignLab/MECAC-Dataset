feat: Add map HUD controls to track appearance screen

Extract map HUD controls (my location, zoom buttons) into a new shared layout `map_hud_controls.xml`.
Integrate these controls into `TrackAppearanceFragment` to provide direct map interaction.
The controls' visibility and position now dynamically adjust based on the `TrackAppearanceFragment`'s context menu state, appearing when the menu is in a header-only state.
