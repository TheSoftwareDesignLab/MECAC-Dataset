fix: Address potential memory leaks and improve widget management

- Use WeakReference for OsmandSettings listeners to prevent memory leaks.
  Listeners are now garbage collected if no other strong references exist.
- Ensure map widgets (Distance, Monitoring, OsMo) are registered only once.
  This prevents redundant registrations when updateLayers is called.
- Optimize map bitmap creation by dynamically selecting ARGB_8888 or RGB_565 config.
  Allows reuse of bitmaps with matching configuration and improves rendering.
