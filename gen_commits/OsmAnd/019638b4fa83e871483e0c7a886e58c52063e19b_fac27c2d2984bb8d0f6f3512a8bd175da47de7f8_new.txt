feat: Improve map object selection and add amenity data lookup

Introduces a `ResourceManager` to efficiently search and retrieve `net.osmand.data.Amenity` objects from binary map files. This enables:
- More robust map object selection, transitioning from JNI objects to core data objects.
- Display of a multi-selection context menu when multiple objects are found at a tap location.
- Integration of the multi-selection menu directly within the `MapContextMenu`.

Also includes a style update for expandable list item backgrounds.
