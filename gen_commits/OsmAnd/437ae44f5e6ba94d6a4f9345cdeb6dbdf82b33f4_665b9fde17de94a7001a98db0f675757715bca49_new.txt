fix(dashboard): Refine scroll animation and layout

Refactor dashboard scroll alpha animation logic for smoother transitions
and proper handling during fast scrolling. Introduced a `setAlpha` helper
method to manage transparency across different API levels more effectively.

Extracted the dashboard toolbar height into a new dimension resource
(`dashboard_map_toolbar`) and adjusted `dashboard_map_top_blur`.
Made minor layout adjustments to `dash_navigation.xml` by removing
unused padding/margins and specifying text size directly.
