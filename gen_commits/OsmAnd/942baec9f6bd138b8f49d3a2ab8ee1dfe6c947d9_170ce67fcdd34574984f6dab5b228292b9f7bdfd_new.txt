refactor: Refine routing context setup and thread task execution

Update CurrentPositionHelper to initialize the default routing context
using files from address repositories. This ensures the context has
access to address-specific map data.

Remove unnecessary synchronization block during task execution in
RoutingHelper, improving concurrency for route calculation jobs.
