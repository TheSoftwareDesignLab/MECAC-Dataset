feat: Auto-hide keyboard when scrolling search lists

In QuickSearchCustomPoiFragment and QuickSearchSubCategoriesFragment, the soft
keyboard will now automatically dismiss when the user starts to scroll the list.
This improves the user experience by preventing the keyboard from obscuring
list content during navigation.
