fix: Resolve menu background based on layout direction

Previously, background attributes for side menus and panels were always resolved using `left_menu_view_bg`. This change introduces a check for the layout direction (RTL/LTR) to dynamically select between `left_menu_view_bg` and `right_menu_view_bg`. This ensures correct background rendering for UI components in RTL mode.
