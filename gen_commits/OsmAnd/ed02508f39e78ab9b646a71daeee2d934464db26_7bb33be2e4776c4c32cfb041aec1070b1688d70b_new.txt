feat: Add OK/Cancel buttons to boolean settings dialogs

Multi-choice boolean settings dialogs (e.g., for alarms, speaking options)
now include "OK" and "Cancel" buttons. Changes are only applied when "OK" is
pressed, allowing users to revert selections with "Cancel". Dialogs now also
display a dynamic title.

Introduced a new createListPreference overload in SettingsBaseActivity to
allow setting title and summary directly during creation.
