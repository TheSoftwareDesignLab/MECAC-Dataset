fix: Consume multi-touch end event when zoom mode active

Ensures that the ACTION_UP or ACTION_CANCEL event is fully consumed
by MultiTouchSupport when a multi-touch zoom or rotation gesture
ends and was active. This prevents other listeners from processing
the event and ensures correct event flow after a gesture completion.
