refactor: Migrate search/POI filter UI to TextViewEx, add shadows

Replaced AppCompatTextView and AppCompatButton with TextViewEx in search and POI filter layouts.
This change centralizes font control (roboto_medium) and text casing using osmand:typeface and osmand:textAllCapsCompat attributes.
Also, introduced shadow drawables above bottom action bars for improved visual separation.
Adjusted text sizes and button heights for consistency.
