refactor: Standardize map pixel coordinate calculations

Consistently use NativeUtilities.getPixelFromLatLon for converting LatLon coordinates to screen pixels. This change removes redundant helper methods like 'getCenterPoint' and 'latLonToScreenPoint', simplifying the code and ensuring a unified approach for pixel calculations in the ruler layers.
