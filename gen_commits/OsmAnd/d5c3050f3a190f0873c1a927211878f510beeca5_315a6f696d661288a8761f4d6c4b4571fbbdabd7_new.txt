feat: Improve GPX track start/end time display

Format GPX track start and end times more concisely in the context menu.
If the start and end times fall on the same day, only the time part will be shown for the end time, avoiding redundant date information.
Introduced `isSameDay(long, long)` utility method in `OsmAndFormatter` and made `isSameDay(Calendar, Calendar)` public.
