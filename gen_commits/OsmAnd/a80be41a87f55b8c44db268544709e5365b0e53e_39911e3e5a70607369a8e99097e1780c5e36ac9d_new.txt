refactor: Centralize and specialize quick action dialog titles

Introduce `getDialogTitle` method in `SelectMapLocationAction` and override it in derived navigation quick actions. This allows for more specific and descriptive dialog titles (e.g., "Add destination point") when selecting a location, replacing the generic "Choose location".
