refactor(tracks): Unify folder paths and enhance sorting capabilities

Standardized track folder handling to use absolute paths consistently across import, save, and selection dialogs. This improves reliability and flexibility in track management.

Further enhancements include:
- Refactored `TrackFolderAnalysis` for better encapsulation and lazy loading within `TrackFolder`.
- Introduced new sorting modes for track folders: by date, distance, and duration.
- Migrated `SortByBottomSheet` to `MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment` to provide contextual sorting options.
- Fixed an inversion bug in `TrackFoldersHelper.isLoadingTracks()`.
- Improved UI/UX for new folder creation dialog with immediate focus and keyboard.
- Updated recording track item layout and description formatting.
- Changed "Menu" button to "More actions" in My Places tracks view.
