refactor: Distinguish desired and active car nav states

Rename `carNavigationActive` to `carNavigationShouldBeActive` to clarify that the
variable represents the intent for car navigation to be active, potentially
before `NavigationManager` is fully initialized. This ensures `navigationStarted()`
is correctly invoked once the manager is available, addressing potential timing issues.
The `isCarNavigationActive()` method has been removed as it's no longer needed.
