refactor: Improve purchase dialogs and free version banner

- Removed `purchase_dialog_active_card_row.xml` to consolidate layouts.
- Standardized XML namespaces (`xmlns:osmand`, `xmlns:tools`) and added `tools:text` attributes across several purchase dialog layouts for better Android Studio preview support.
- Simplified the presentation of the `FREE_VERSION_BANNER` in `ChoosePlanDialogFragment` to use a single TextView and added dismiss button listeners.
- Activated the `isDeveloperVersion` check in `Version.java`.
