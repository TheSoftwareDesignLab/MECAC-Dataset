feat: Add nightly adaptive icon and scale drawable logos

Introduces a new adaptive icon definition for the nightly application,
ensuring proper display on Android 8.0+ devices.

The logo drawables (`ic_launcher_osmand_monochrome.xml`,
`ic_launcher_osmand_nightly_logo.xml`, and
`ic_launcher_osmand_plus_monochrome.xml`) have been scaled
from 0.75 to 0.85 and re-centered to improve their visual
prominence and alignment.
