feat: Add setting to keep map position on double-tap zoom

Introduces a new preference, "Keep map center on double-tap zoom", to modify double-tap zoom behavior.
When enabled, double-tapping to zoom in will attempt to keep the current map center (or a relative point) as the zoom focus, rather than centering on the tapped location. This provides a "magnify" effect.
Includes improved animation handling for combined zoom and pan movements.
