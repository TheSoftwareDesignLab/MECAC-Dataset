feat: Control Wikipedia button visibility based on scroll direction

Previously, the "Read Full Article" button was hidden during any web view scroll/move and shown on touch start/end. This change introduces logic to detect vertical scroll direction after a touch gesture. The button is now hidden when the user scrolls down the Wikipedia article content and shown when scrolling up, improving the reading experience.
