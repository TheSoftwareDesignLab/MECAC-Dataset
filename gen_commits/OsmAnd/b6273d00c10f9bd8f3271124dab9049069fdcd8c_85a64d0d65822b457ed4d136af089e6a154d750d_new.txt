refactor: Use double for zoom-related calculations

Changed `zoomScale` and `zoomAnimation` fields in `RotatedTileBox` from `float` to `double`.
Updated all related methods, parameters, and calculations across the application
to use `double` for fractional zoom levels, improving precision in map rendering
and animation.
