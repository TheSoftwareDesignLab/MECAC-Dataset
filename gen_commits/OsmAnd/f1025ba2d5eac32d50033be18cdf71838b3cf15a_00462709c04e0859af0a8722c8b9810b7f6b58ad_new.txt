feat: Show detailed zoom and map density info

The zoom level display in both the development widget and map controls layer has been enhanced.
The ZoomLevelWidget now calculates and displays a precise offset based on fractional zoom and map density.
The MapControlsLayer also shows a more detailed fractional zoom (with sign and leading zero) and the map density value.
This provides users with a more comprehensive understanding of the current map's scale.
