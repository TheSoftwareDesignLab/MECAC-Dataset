feat: Support sharing plain text to quick search

Switches from handling `android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT` to `android.intent.action.SEND` for `text/plain` mime type. This allows OsmAnd to receive shared plain text from any application that supports standard text sharing, directing it to the Quick Search functionality. The previous `PROCESS_TEXT` action was specific to Android M's text selection context menu.
