refactor: Extract and reuse map animation zoom calculation

Moves the logic for calculating the optimal initial zoom level for map animations into a new reusable method, `AnimateDraggingMapThread#calculateMoveZoom`. This method determines a zoom that keeps the target location within a reasonable pixel distance, preventing very fast or skipped animations for distant targets. It is now used to adjust the zoom in `MapContextMenuFragment` before showing a point on the map.
