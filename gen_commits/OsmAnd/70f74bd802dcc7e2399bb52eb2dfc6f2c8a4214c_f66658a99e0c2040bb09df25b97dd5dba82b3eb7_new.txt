refactor: Apply ListText style for UI consistency

Centralizes text styling by replacing hardcoded `android:textSize` attributes
with `@style/ListText` in various layout files. This improves maintainability
and ensures consistent typography across the application.
Also includes a minor text color update in `search_main.xml`.
