refactor: Unify MapRendererView event handling and animation

Migrate OsmandMapLayer to implement MapRendererViewListener, enabling layers to subscribe to onUpdateFrame callbacks directly from MapRendererView. This replaces the use of MapRendererTargetChangedObservable in layers like PointLocationLayer and RouteLayer.
Centralize animation control within MapRendererView by removing the dedicated MapAnimator in AnimateDraggingMapThread, simplifying animation management.
Ensure all derived map layers properly call super.onPrepareBufferImage to facilitate the new listener registration logic.
