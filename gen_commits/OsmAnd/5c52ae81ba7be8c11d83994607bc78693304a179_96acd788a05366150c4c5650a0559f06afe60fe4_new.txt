refactor: Migrate backup status UI to RecyclerView

The backup and restore status screen has been refactored to use a RecyclerView.
This replaces the previous static card-based layout with a more flexible and efficient RecyclerView implementation.

- Removed `BackupUploadCard`, `LocalBackupCard`, and `RestoreBackupCard` classes.
- Introduced `BackupStatusAdapter` and dedicated `ViewHolder` classes (`HeaderStatusViewHolder`, `WarningViewHolder`, `ItemViewHolder`, `ConflictViewHolder`, `ActionButtonViewHolder`, `LocalBackupViewHolder`, `RestoreBackupViewHolder`) for various UI components.
- Updated `ExportBackupTask` to include item-specific and general progress tracking.
- Renamed and made `BackupStatus` enum public.
- Adjusted background colors for list items in `backup_upload_item.xml` and `backup_warning.xml`.
- Modified `OsmandBaseExpandableListAdapter` to use a static `adjustIndicator` helper.
