refactor: Migrate MAP_ACTIVITY_ENABLED to boolean and improve nav session stop logic

Migrates the `MAP_ACTIVITY_ENABLED` setting from an `OsmandPreference<Boolean>`
object to a simple `boolean` field, simplifying its usage across the application.

Additionally, fixes an issue in `NavigationSession` where the application mode
was reset incorrectly when a session stopped, even if a route was active.
The app mode will now only be reset if no routing is currently active.
