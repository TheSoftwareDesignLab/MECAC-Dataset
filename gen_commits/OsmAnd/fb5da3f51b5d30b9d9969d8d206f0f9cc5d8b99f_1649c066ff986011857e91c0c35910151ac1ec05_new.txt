feat: Add online routing engine URL testing

Implements the ability to test custom online routing engine URLs directly from the settings screen. Users can input a URL in the example card, trigger a test, and see the success or failure of the routing request in a dedicated result view. This helps verify the correct setup of custom routing engines (GraphHopper or OSRM).
