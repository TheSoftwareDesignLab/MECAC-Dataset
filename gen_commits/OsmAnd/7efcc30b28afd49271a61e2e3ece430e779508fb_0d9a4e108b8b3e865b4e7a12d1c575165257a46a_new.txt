feat(android-auto): Auto-fit map to route after calculation

Automatically adjusts the map view in Android Auto to display the full calculated route.

This change introduces:
- Finer-grained zoom control (`smallZoomIn`/`smallZoomOut`) for map adjustments.
- An overloaded `fitRectToMap` method to utilize this precise zooming.
- The route preparation menu will no longer automatically open in Car View mode after route calculation, as the map now auto-adjusts.
