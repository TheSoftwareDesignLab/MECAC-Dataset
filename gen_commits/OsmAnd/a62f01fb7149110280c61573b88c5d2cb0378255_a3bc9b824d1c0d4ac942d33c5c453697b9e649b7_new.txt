feat: Add 'moveable' property to fix widget positions

Introduce a `moveable` property for `ButtonPositionSize` to control whether a UI element can be repositioned.
This property is set to `false` for key map HUD elements like widget panels, the top bar, measurement buttons, and recording layouts, preventing their movement.
