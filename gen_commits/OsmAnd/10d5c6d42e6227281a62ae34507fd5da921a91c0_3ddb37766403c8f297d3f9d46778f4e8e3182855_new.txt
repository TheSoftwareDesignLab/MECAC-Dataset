feat: Implement scrollable UI for download map fragment

Wrap download tiles fragment content in a LockableScrollView. This allows the UI to be scrolled, particularly useful in portrait mode to accommodate more content.
Map interaction is improved by temporarily disabling parent scrolling when the map window is touched, and re-enabling it after interaction. The map view also re-centers its focus upon parent scroll events.
