feat: Improve profile settings and reset bottom sheet UI

Introduced new layouts for bottom sheet preference info and profile items with radio buttons. Added support for custom backgrounds to `BaseBottomSheetItem` classes.

Reworked `ResetProfilePrefsBottomSheet` to leverage these new components, providing a clearer and more visually consistent presentation of the profile to be reset and the action's description.

Also includes:
- Renamed "Copy from other profile" preference key and method to "Copy profile settings".
- Reordered profile actions in `configure_profile.xml`.
- Corrected typos in `MenuBottomSheetDialogFragment` for button type methods.
- Refined action icon click logic in `EditProfilesFragment` for custom profiles.
