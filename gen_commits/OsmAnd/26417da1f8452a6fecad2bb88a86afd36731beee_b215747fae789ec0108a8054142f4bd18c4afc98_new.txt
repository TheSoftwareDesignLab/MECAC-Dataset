refactor(backup): Simplify authorization UI logic

Removed explicit toolbar title setting, relying on parent activity or fragment's defined title.
Streamlined the "Sign Up" button's logic by removing the subscription check. The "Create new account" option is now always available, simplifying the onboarding flow for OsmAnd Cloud.
