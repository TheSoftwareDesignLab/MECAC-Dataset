fix: Improve POI editor UI behavior and focus management

- Reset scroll position when switching tabs in the POI editor dialog.
- Clear existing views before binding opening hours data to prevent duplicates.
- Enhance focus and soft keyboard display for new tag input fields.
- Centralize `currentTagEditText` management within `EditPoiContentAdapter`.
