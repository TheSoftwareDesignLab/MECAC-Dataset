refactor: Improve map refresh and transport lines UI

- Updated map refresh mechanism to use `OsmandMapTileView.refreshMap(true)`
  and `mapActivity.updateLayers()` for consistent updates.
- Added bottom spacing to the transport lines fragment for better layout.
- Disabled state saving for switches in bottom sheet items to prevent
  unintended state restoration.
