feat: Improve OSM authorization feedback and AIDL widget icon handling

Display a success toast message after OSM authorization if no warning is present.
For AIDL widgets, handle cases where menu icon resources are not found by using `ContextMenuItem.INVALID_ID` instead of `0`, preventing potential issues with invalid resource IDs.
