feat: Add theme-aware tinting to splash screen text

Refactor splash screen background color logic for clarity using a dedicated variable for system default night mode.
Introduce a `textColorId` to select between light and dark text colors based on the active theme.
Apply dynamic tinting to all OsmAnd and OpenStreetMap text images using `UiUtilities`, ensuring visual consistency and readability across different themes, especially when system default night mode is active.
