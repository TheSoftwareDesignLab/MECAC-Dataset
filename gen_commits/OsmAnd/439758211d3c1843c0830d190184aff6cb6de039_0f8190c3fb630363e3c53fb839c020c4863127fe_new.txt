refactor: Simplify splash screen text logic and remove debug log

- Refactored the logic for displaying the "OsmAnd InApp" text on the second splash screen
  to check `InAppHelper.isFullVersionPurchased()` instead of multiple individual plugin/purchase checks.
- Removed an obsolete debug log statement from the splash screen dismissal process.
