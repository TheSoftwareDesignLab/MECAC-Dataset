fix(context-menu): Adjust text vertical positioning

Corrects the vertical translation of the text view within the context menu layer.
Previously, `textView.getTop()` was used, which could lead to incorrect alignment.
Changing to `textView.getBottom()` ensures the text is properly positioned relative to its anchor point.
