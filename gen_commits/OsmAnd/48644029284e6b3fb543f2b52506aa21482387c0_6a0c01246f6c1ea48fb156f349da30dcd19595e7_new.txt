feat: Add finger location support for map markers

This feature allows users to temporarily use their finger's location as the reference point for map markers.
When a user long-presses and drags on the map, the map marker distance and direction arrows will point relative to the finger's position after a short delay.
This temporary state is reset when the finger is lifted or on another long press.
The `MapMarkersWidget` has been updated to display information relative to this custom finger location.
