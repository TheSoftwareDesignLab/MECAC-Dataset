fix: Invert OFF_ROUTE_DISTANCE scaling

Previously, OFF_ROUTE_DISTANCE scaled directly with arrivalDistanceFactor,
leading to unintended behavior. This change inverts the scaling logic
using (2.0f - arrivalDistanceFactor) to ensure it adjusts inversely,
providing more consistent control over navigation announcement parameters.
