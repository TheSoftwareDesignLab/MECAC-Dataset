refactor: Remove redundant content descriptions from context menu icons

Removed `android:contentDescription` from `ImageView` elements in the map context menu.
These icons are part of composite buttons that also include a `TextView`, which already provides the necessary accessible label.
This change avoids potential duplication for screen readers, improving accessibility.
