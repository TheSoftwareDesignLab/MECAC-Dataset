feat: Dynamically style travel download/update button

The primary download/update button for travel cards now dynamically adjusts its background and text color based on its enabled state, which is determined by internet availability. This provides better visual feedback to the user.
New helper methods `getPrimaryBtnBgRes` and `getPrimaryBtnTextColorRes` were introduced to manage the styling.
