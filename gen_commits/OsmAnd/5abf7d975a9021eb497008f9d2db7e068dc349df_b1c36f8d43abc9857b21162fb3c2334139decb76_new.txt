feat: Adjust voice prompt distances and logic

Refactor PREPARE_LONG_DISTANCE initialization to updateAppMode().
Update voice prompt distances and default speed for various modes:
- Increase PREPARE_DISTANCE_END for pedestrians.
- Increase TURN_IN_DISTANCE, TURN_IN_DISTANCE_END, TURN_DISTANCE, and DEFAULT_SPEED for car/bicycle modes.
Enhance voice guidance logic in updateStatus():
- Modify condition for playGoAhead() based on speed and turn-in distance.
- Introduce more granular conditions for STATUS_UNKNOWN, STATUS_LONG_PREPARE, and STATUS_PREPARE messages.
Disable "prepare" voice prompts for "keep left/right" turn types.
