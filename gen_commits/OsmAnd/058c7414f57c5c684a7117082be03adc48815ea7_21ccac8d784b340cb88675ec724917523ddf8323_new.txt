feat: Revamp settings export/import UI and categorization

The settings export screen has been redesigned from a bottom sheet to a full-screen fragment. Exportable items are now categorized into "Settings", "My Places", and "Resources" for improved clarity. The UI includes updated item selection and approximate file size display. Internal refactoring was done to support the new categorization.
