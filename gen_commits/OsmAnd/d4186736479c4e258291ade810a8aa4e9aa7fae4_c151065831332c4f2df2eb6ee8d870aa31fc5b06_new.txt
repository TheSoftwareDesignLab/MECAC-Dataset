feat: Enhance AIDL navigation drawer item management

Refactor AIDL API to support multiple "Open App" navigation drawer items.
Items are now stored as a JSON array in a single preference, replacing individual item preferences. Each item includes the `appPackage` and is limited to 3 items per app, removing older ones if the limit is exceeded. Updates registration logic to display all stored items.
