fix: Improve multi-touch zoom/rotate centering logic

Re-engineered multi-touch map centering during zoom and rotate gestures.
The map now re-centers by calculating the offset between the initial
pinch LatLon and the current multi-touch point in 31-tile coordinates,
then applying this delta to the map's target. This replaces the previous
`initialCenterTile` approach, providing more robust and accurate re-centering.
