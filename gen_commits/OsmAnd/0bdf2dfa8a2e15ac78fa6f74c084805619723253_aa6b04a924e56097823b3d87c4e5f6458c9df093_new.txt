feat: Add gradient coloring for route line

Introduce the ability to color route lines dynamically based on their altitude or slope profile.

This includes:
- Adding 'Altitude' and 'Slope' as new color modes in the 'Route Line Color' settings.
- Implementing a `GradientCard` to display relevant min/max values for the selected gradient type.
- Storing the chosen gradient scale type in `RouteLineDrawInfo` and application settings.
- Updating route rendering logic to apply gradient colors when selected, both for preview and on the map.
- Adjusting `gradient_card.xml` to support flexible content presentation for gradient data.

This provides users with a new way to visualize route characteristics directly on the map.
