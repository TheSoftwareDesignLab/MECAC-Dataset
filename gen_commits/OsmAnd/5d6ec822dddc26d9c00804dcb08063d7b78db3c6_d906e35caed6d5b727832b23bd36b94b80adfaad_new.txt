feat: Enhance Edit POI dialogs with theming and local edit feedback

Apply day/night theme to all dialogs and their custom views (EditText, CheckBox, LinearLayout) within the Edit POI screen, ensuring visual consistency.
Display the OsmAnd context menu for locally saved POI edits after deletion, providing immediate feedback.
Refactor internal classes by renaming `MyAdapter` to `poiInfoPagerAdapter` and adjusting method/constructor visibility to package-private.
Updated `TAG` to use `getSimpleName()`.
