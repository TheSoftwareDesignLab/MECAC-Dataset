feat: Make compass button dynamic and configurable

Introduces the ability to dynamically move the compass button to the map's
dashboard when the "Configure Map" section is active, and restore it
afterward.

This change also refactors widget management by distinguishing between
widget visibility (on the map) and availability (in the settings menu)
using dedicated maps and registration methods. The compass button is
now registered as a side widget, allowing its visibility to be managed.
