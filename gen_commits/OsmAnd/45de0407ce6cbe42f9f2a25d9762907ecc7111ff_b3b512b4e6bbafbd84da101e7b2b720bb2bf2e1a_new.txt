feat: Rework map widgets configuration with drag & drop reorder

This commit introduces a redesigned UI for configuring map widgets,
allowing drag-and-drop reordering of widgets and pages/rows.
It includes validation rules for complex widget placement in vertical
panels, adds a dedicated empty state view, and refines widget item
layouts with individual dividers.
