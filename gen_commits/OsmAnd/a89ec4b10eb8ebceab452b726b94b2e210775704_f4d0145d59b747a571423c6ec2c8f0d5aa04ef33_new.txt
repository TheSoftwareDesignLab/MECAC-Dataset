fix: Correctly handle point names and name IDs in RouteDataObject

Ensures that `pointNames` and `pointNameTypes` arrays are properly resized and shifted
when inserting a new point into `RouteDataObject`. Previously, these arrays
were not handled, which could lead to data loss or incorrect data.
Also, the `nameIds` array is now correctly copied in the copy constructor
to maintain data integrity. A static logger instance was added.
