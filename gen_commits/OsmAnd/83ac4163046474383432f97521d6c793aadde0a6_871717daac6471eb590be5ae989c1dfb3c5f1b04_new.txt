fix: Correctly hide profile availability switch for Default mode

Refactors the logic in `ConfigureProfileFragment` to consistently manage the visibility of the profile availability switch. The switch, which toggles a profile's active status, is now reliably hidden for the "Default" application mode and shown for other custom profiles.

Adds state persistence for `profileDependent` in `BasePreferenceBottomSheet`.
