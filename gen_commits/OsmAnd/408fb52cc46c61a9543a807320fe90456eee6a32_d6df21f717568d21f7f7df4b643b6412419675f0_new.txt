refactor: Unify download and update selection dialogs

Introduces `MultiSelectionMode` enum to `SelectIndexesHelper` to allow
dynamic configuration of dialog titles and action buttons. This enables
reusing the helper for both map download and update operations with
context-specific texts. The `UpdatesIndexFragment` now explicitly uses
the 'update' mode, displaying 'Update maps' as the dialog title.
