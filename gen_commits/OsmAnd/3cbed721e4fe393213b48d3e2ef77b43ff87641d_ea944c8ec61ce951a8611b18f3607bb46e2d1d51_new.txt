refactor: Unify 3D map tilt angle calculation logic

Extracts the 3D map tilt angle calculation into a reusable method
`getAdjustedTiltAngle` within `OsmandMapTileView`. This method
centralizes the logic, which is now consumed by `Map3DButton`
to determine the default elevation angle, removing redundant
hardcoded angle definitions.
