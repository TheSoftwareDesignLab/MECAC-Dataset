feat: Add Dashboard button to route preparation in landscape

- Introduced a new Dashboard button to the route preparation bottom bar, visible only in landscape orientation.
- Increased the width of the route planning layout (`map_route_planning_land_width`) to accommodate new controls.
- Improved visibility management of map controls (zoom, layers, compass, menu, location) by hiding them when route info or preferences dialogs are active, reducing UI clutter.
- Replaced `dialog.hide()` with `dialog.dismiss()` for better dialog lifecycle management in `MapRouteInfoControl` and `MapRoutePreferencesControl`.
