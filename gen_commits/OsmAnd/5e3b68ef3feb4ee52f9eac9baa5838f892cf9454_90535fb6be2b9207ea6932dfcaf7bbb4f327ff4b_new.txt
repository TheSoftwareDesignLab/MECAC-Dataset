refactor: Migrate coordinate input keyboard to LinearLayout

Rewrites the coordinate input keyboard implementation from a GridView-based approach to a custom LinearLayout layout. This change provides more flexibility for styling and direct control over individual key elements.

Key changes include:
- Introduction of a dedicated 'coordinate_input_keyboard.xml' layout.
- Replacement of GridView with the new LinearLayout layout in dialogs.
- Removal of the custom 'KeyboardAdapter' class.
- New drawable selectors for keyboard item backgrounds.
- Refactored fragment logic to set up and handle key clicks using explicit view IDs and `setupKeyboardItems` method.
- Renamed `keyboard_item_bg_pressed` to `keyboard_item_pressed_bg` for consistency.
