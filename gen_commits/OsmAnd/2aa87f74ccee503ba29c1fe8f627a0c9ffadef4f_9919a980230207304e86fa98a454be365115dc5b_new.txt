feat: Automate special phrase generation and refactor loading

Introduces a new shell script (`generate.sh`) to automate the process of fetching, parsing, and generating `specialphrases_*.txt` files from the OpenStreetMap wiki.

Refactors the special phrase loading logic by moving language selection into the `SpecialPhrases` class itself. This makes `SpecialPhrases` more self-contained and removes conditional logic from `OsmandApplication`. Updated Javadoc clarifies behavior regarding uninitialized language or missing keys.
