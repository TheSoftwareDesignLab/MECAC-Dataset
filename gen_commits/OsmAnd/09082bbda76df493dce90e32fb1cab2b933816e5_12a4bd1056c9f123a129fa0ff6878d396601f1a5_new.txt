fix: Use mode-specific settings for Turn Screen On power button

Previously, the enabled state of the 'Turn screen on power button' preference was determined using global settings. This commit updates the logic to retrieve mode-specific values for 'Turn screen on time' and 'Use system screen timeout', ensuring the preference's enabled state accurately reflects the current application mode.
