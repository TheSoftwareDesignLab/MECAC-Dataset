feat: Enhance double-tap scaling with visual marks and better detection

Corrected display height calculation (`displayHeightPx`) to use `size.y` instead of `size.x` in both `DoubleTapScaleDetector` and `OsmandMapTileView`. This resolves an issue with incorrect scaling on certain devices or orientations.

Refined double-tap scale gesture detection by introducing a delay before confirming `isDoubleTapping` during an `ACTION_MOVE` event. This prevents premature activation and improves gesture accuracy.

Implemented a new visual scale indicator in `OsmandMapTileView`, displaying a vertical line with marks representing zoom levels per screen height, utilizing `SCALE_PER_SCREEN`.

Disabled long-press events while the double-tap scale gesture is active to prevent conflicts.
