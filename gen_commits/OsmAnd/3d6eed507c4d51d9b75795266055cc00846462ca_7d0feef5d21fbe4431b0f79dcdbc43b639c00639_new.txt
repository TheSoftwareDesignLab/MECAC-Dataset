refactor(fr): Translate new strings and refine route message

Translated several previously English strings to French, including descriptions for speed cameras, speed limits, toll roads, and the recent changes tip.
Corrected the translation for `route_updated_loc_found` from "parcours" to "itinéraire" for improved accuracy.
