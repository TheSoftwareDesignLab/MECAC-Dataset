fix: Improve map text rendering and collision detection

- Refactored `isClockwiseWay` method from `MapSwingAlgorithms` to `MapAlgorithms`,
  and removed the deprecated `MapSwingAlgorithms` class.
- Enhanced text rendering logic in `OsmandRenderer` by refining bounding box
  calculations for text, particularly for text drawn along paths.
- Improved collision detection and spacing by more accurately considering
  text height, width, rotation, and `minDistance`.
- Passed `pathRotate` to `TextDrawInfo` for better orientation handling.
- Adjusted the length condition for drawing text on polylines.
