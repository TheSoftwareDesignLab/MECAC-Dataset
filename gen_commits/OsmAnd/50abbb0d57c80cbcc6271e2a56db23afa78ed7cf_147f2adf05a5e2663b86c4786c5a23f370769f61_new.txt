feat: Enhance map URL handling in AndroidManifest

Consolidates intent filters for various map provider URLs into a single block.
This adds support for 'maps.yandex.com', 'map.baidu.cn', and 'map.baidu.com'
hosts, and merges OpenStreetMap hosts into the broader filter for improved
URL scheme parsing and maintainability.
