refactor: Use OnlineRoutingEngine.equals for state comparison

Add an `equals` method to `OnlineRoutingEngine` to enable direct comparison of engine instances.
Remove the redundant `OnlineRoutingEngineObject` nested class and its associated initialization keys.
Refactor `OnlineRoutingEngineFragment` to leverage the new `equals` method for detecting unsaved changes,
simplifying the code and improving state management by using `OnlineRoutingEngine` instances directly.
