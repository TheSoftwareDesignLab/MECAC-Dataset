feat: Introduce Quick Actions Widget structure

Adds foundational files for the new Quick Actions widget. This includes
the main widget layout, an item layout for individual quick actions,
and the `QuickActionsWidget.java` class with a `PagerAdapter`
to manage quick action views. Initial setup for ViewPager and navigation
buttons are present but commented out, indicating an early stage of
development for this new UI component.
