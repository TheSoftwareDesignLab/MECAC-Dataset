refactor: Streamline zoom animation and touch gesture logic

- Refactor zoom calculation during animation to consistently manage `zoomAnimation` and `zoomFloatPart`.
- Simplify multi-touch gesture end handling by consolidating state updates.
- Rename `finishZoomAndRotationGesture` to `finishPinchZoom` for improved semantic clarity.
