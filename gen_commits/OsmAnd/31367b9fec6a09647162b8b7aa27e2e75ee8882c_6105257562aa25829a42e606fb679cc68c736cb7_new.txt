feat: Support multi-line quick action titles in dialog and list

Enhances the quick action name input and display:
- The quick action create/edit dialog now allows the name input field
  to span up to 5 lines, dynamically adjusting the dialog's height.
- Quick action list items now display titles across up to 2 lines,
  truncating with an ellipsis if the text exceeds this limit.
