refactor: Centralize day/night mode logic across fragments

Encapsulated day/night mode detection in `DayNightHelper.isNightMode(boolean usedOnMap)`.
Promoted `nightMode` field and `isNightMode()` method to base fragment classes, along with `useMapNightMode()` for specific context.
Removed redundant `nightMode` fields and repetitive `isNightMode()` calls in numerous fragments.
Added fragment re-attachment on `onConfigurationChanged` in `MapActivity` to ensure consistent theme updates.
