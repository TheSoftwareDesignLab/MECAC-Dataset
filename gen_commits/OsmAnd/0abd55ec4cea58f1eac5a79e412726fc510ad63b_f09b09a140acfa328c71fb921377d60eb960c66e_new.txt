feat: Enhance Mappers promo sign-in button UI with OSM logo

Adds an OpenStreetMap logo icon to the "Sign in with OpenStreetMap" button
in the Mappers promo fragment.

Also:
- Adjusted horizontal margins of the sign-in button for better spacing.
- Refined text view width and gravity within the sign-in button.
- Standardized all relevant buttons to use `ROUNDED_SMALL` for a consistent look.
