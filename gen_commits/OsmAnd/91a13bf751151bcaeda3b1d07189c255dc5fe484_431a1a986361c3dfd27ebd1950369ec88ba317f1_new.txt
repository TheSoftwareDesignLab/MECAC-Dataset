feat: Fit route on map when opening route menu in collapsed state

When the route preparation menu (`ChooseRouteFragment`) is opened in a
collapsed state (e.g., header only), the map will now automatically adjust
to show the full calculated route. This provides immediate visual context
of the route on the map.

- Introduced `ADJUST_MAP_KEY` to signal if the map should be adjusted.
- `showFromRouteInfo` now passes `ADJUST_MAP_KEY=true` when the initial
  menu state is not `FULL_SCREEN`.
- Added a new `showRouteOnMap()` method in `RouteDetailsFragment` to
  consolidate the logic for fitting different route types on the map.
