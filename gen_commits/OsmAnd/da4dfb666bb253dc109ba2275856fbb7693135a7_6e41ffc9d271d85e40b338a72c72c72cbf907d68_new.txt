refactor: Standardize map animation completion callbacks

The `AnimateDraggingMapThread.startMoving` method has been refactored to remove the `joinAnimations` parameter and introduce a `finishAnimationCallback`. This provides a consistent way for callers to be notified upon animation completion.

The `movingToMyLocation` flag in `MapViewTrackingUtilities` is now reset via this new callback.
