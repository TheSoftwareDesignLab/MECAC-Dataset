feat: Add extensive route activity types and refactor handling

Introduced a comprehensive set of new route activity types for better
categorization and filtering. This includes various forms of motorcycling,
cycling, hiking, water sports, and aviation, exposed via new string resources.

Refactored the internal constant `ACTIVITY_TYPE` to `ROUTE_ACTIVITY_TYPE`
for improved clarity and consistency. A new `ROUTE_TYPE` constant was also added.
Updated GPX processing logic to correctly manage and extract these activity types
into GPX metadata.
