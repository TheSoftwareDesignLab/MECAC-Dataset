refactor: Hide route recalculation text and restructure UI

The TextView displaying the "recalculate route to your location" message has been commented out,
removing it from the user interface.
A new LinearLayout was added inside the ScrollView to group the remaining UI elements,
such as the "non-optimal route calculation" checkbox, improving layout structure and maintainability.
