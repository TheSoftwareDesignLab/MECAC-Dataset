feat: Rework selection bottom sheets and SRTM download UI

Introduces a new hierarchy for selection bottom sheets, with `SelectionBottomSheet` as a base class. This enables `SelectModeBottomSheet` for single-item mode selection and `SelectMultipleWithModeBottomSheet` for multiple selection with mode. `SelectMultipleItemsBottomSheet` is refactored to extend the new base.
Updates SRTM download dialogs to leverage the new bottom sheet types, providing distinct UIs for single and multiple SRTM selections, including metric/imperial unit choice.
Renames 'MultipleIndexesUiHelper' to 'SelectIndexesUiHelper'.
