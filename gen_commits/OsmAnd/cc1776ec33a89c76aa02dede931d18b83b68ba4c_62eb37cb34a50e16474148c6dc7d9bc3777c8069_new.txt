refactor: Improve Measurement Tool UI and expand/collapse logic

- Redesigned custom radio buttons to use a central divider instead of a button.
- Reorganized Measurement Tool fragment layout, moving radio buttons to the bottom of the header.
- Refined logic for expanding and collapsing additional info (points/graph) views.
- Introduced a neutral collapsed state for custom radio buttons.
- Set consistent minimum widths for action buttons in the measurement tool.
- Disabled X-axis points on charts within the Measurement Tool.
