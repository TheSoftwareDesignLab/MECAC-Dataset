feat: Persist Send POI comment and improve editor UI

- The comment message in the "Send POI" dialog is now persisted across dialog openings, remembering the last entered text.
- Updated the "Edit POI Advanced" layout to use theme-aware text colors for improved dark mode compatibility.
- Added `tools:text` attributes to the layout for better design-time preview.
