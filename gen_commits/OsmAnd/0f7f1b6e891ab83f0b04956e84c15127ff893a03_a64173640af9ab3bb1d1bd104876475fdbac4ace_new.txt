feat: Add filename to GeneralRouter profiles

Introduce a 'filename' field in GeneralRouter to track the source XML file of a routing profile.
Refactor RoutingConfiguration's parsing methods to accept and propagate the filename to the GeneralRouter instances.
Update AppInitializer to asynchronously load custom routing profiles and set their filenames.
This change allows associating a routing profile with its original definition file.

Also includes minor refactoring of HashMap initializations using type inference and a UI fix in ProfileBottomSheetDialogFragment for correct item selection display.
