feat: Generalize local OSM modifications for POIs and Bugs

Introduced `OsmPoint` as a base class for `OpenstreetmapPoint` and `OsmbugsPoint`, centralizing the `Action` enum and string mappings. Updated UI strings and menu IDs to reflect broader support for both POI and Bug modifications. Refactored `LocalOpenstreetmapActivity` to manage and upload both types through a unified interface.
