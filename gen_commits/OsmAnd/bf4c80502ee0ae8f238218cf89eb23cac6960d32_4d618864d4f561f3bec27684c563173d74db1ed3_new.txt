perf: Cache map marker line paths for rendering

Previously, line paths connecting map markers to the current location were
recalculated for every marker on each redraw. This commit introduces a cache
(`cachedPaths` HashMap) for these `Path` objects.

Paths are now only recalculated when:
- The map's zoom level changes.
- The map's target coordinates (`target31`) change.
- The list of active map markers is invalidated.

This change reduces redundant path calculations, improving rendering
performance for map markers.
