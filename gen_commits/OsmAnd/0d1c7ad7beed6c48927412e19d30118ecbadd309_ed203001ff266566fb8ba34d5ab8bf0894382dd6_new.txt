refactor: Unify quick action editing behavior

Removed `isActionEditable()` checks in `CreateEditActionDialog` and `QuickActionsWidget`.
This change ensures the quick action name field is always editable in the dialog
and that the long-click listener for edit/delete options is always attached to items.
All quick actions can now be managed uniformly via the user interface.
