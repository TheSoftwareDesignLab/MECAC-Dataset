feat: Enhance multimedia notes camera app selection

Replaced the boolean switch for choosing between OsmAnd and system camera/video recorder apps with a dialog. When clicking on the "Camera app" preference, users can now select either "System default" or "OsmAnd" from a list for both photo and video capture.

Additionally:
- The "Shutter sound" option is now only visible when the OsmAnd camera app is selected, as system cameras manage their own sound settings.
- Refactored preference IDs into constants for better code maintainability.
