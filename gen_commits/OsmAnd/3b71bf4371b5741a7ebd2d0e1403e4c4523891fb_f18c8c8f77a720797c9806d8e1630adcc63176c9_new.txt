refactor: Implement enum-based location and navigation icons

Replaced direct resource ID usage for map location and navigation icons with `LocationIcon` and `NavigationIcon` enums. This centralizes icon definitions, improving consistency and maintainability across application modes.

Updates include:
- New `map_car_navigation_xml.xml` and `map_nautical_navigation_xml.xml` drawables.
- `ApplicationMode` updated to store and retrieve icons using enums.
- Profile appearance preferences adapted to display and manage the new icon types.
- Map rendering layer (`PointLocationLayer`) updated to draw icons from the enums.
- Renamed preference keys (e.g., `select_map_icon` to `select_location_icon`) for clarity.
