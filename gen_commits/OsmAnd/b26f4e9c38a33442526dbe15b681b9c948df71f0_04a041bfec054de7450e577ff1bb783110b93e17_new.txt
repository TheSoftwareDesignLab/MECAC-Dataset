feat: Add strings for speed cameras, limits, toll roads

Introduces new string resources for displaying speed cameras, speed limits, and options to avoid toll roads in the `values-sk/strings.xml` file. Also includes a new tip string for recent changes.
Note: The added strings are currently in English and need to be translated into Slovak.
