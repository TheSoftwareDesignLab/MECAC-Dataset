fix: Improve map controls visibility logic

Refines the conditions under which zoom buttons and the 'Back to Location'
control are displayed or hidden. Adjusts boolean logic related to various
application states, including track appearance, GPX approximation, route
planning, waypoint choosing, and follow track modes, to ensure correct
UI presentation.
