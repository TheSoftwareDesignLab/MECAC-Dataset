chore: Add native rendering context resource cleanup

Introduces a mechanism to explicitly deallocate native rendering context handles.
The RenderingContext class now stores a native handle and uses its finalize()
method to call a new native function for resource cleanup, preventing potential
memory leaks of native rendering resources.
