feat: Elevation profile chart improvements and GPX refactor

Extracted elevation gain/loss calculation logic into a new `ElevationDiffsCalculator` class for better modularity.
Enhanced the Elevation Profile widget to:
- Highlight the current GPS location on the chart and keep it in view.
- Dynamically update uphill/downhill/max grade metrics based on the visible chart range.
- Allow users to tap the chart to set a highlight and drag to update visible range metrics.
- Utilized a custom `GPXHighlight` for flexible highlight management.
Added bounds check to `RouteCalculationResult.getNextRouteLocation`.
Adjusted chart highlight bar width and refactored `IFillFormatter` to lambda.
