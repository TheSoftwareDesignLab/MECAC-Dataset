fix(hu): Correct hyphenation and phrasing in translation strings

Corrected several instances of hyphenation in Hungarian translation strings for improved grammatical correctness. Specifically, "Telegram-fiók" was changed to "Telegram fiók" and "Telegram-chatre" to "Telegram chatre". Also, "Tovább”-ra" was updated to "Tovább” gombra" for better phrasing.
