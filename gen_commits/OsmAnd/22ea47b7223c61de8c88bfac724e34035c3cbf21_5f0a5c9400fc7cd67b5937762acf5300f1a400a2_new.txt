refactor(ui): Enhance RTL and layout direction consistency

Migrated various XML layouts from physical padding attributes (e.g., `paddingLeft`) to logical margin attributes (e.g., `layout_marginStart`) or structured nested layouts for improved RTL support.
Introduced new helper methods in `AndroidUtils` for API-level safe and RTL-aware manipulation of view padding, margins, and compound drawables.
Centralized layout and text direction application using `UiUtilities.setupLayoutDirection(View)`, which recursively applies direction to views and their children, ensuring consistency across the UI.
Removed redundant layout direction calls in various UI components now covered by the new centralized mechanism.
