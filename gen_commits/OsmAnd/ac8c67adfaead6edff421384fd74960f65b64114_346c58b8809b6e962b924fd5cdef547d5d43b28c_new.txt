fix: Monitoring widget reflects non-global recording status

The 'record' state, indicating profile-based recording, is now an instance
variable in SavingTrackHelper. This state is exposed via getRecord()
and used by OsmandMonitoringPlugin to correctly update the monitoring
widget's icon and track distance display when non-global recording is active.
This change reactivates previously commented-out logic for the widget.
