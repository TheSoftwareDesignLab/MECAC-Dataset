refactor: Streamline Measurement Tool UI and additional info

Restructures the Measurement Tool fragment's layout and logic for managing
additional information panels (points list and graph).
- Moves the custom radio buttons into a dedicated container.
- Centralizes the logic for switching between additional info types.
- Ensures the additional info view collapses when a point is selected on the map.
- Updates the custom radio buttons component to support a central button.
- Removes redundant layout attributes and explicit minimum widths for buttons.
- Simplifies chart X-axis point display logic.
