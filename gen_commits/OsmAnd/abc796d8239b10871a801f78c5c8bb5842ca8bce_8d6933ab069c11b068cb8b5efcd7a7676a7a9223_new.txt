feat: Conditionally show Wikivoyage in map context menu

The "Travel" (Wikivoyage) option in the map context menu will now only be displayed if the Wikivoyage database file is present on the device. This prevents showing a non-functional menu item to users without the data.

The icon for the "Travel" item has been updated to `ic_action_travel`. The `WikivoyageDbHelper` was refactored to introduce an `isDbFileExists` method and centralize database file path resolution.
