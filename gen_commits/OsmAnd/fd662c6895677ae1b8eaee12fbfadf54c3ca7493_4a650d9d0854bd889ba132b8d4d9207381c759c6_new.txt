chore(i18n): Add untranslated navigation settings and tip strings

Adds new string resources for displaying speed cameras, speed limits, avoiding toll roads, and a release version tip. These strings are currently in English and serve as placeholders within the French resource file (values-fr/strings.xml) for future translation.
