refactor: Streamline dashboard card dismissal UX

The "Rate Us" dashboard card dismissal no longer offers a Snackbar with an undo option. Dismissing the card now directly updates user settings and refreshes the dashboard.
The generic `SwipeDismissTouchListener` has been updated to exclusively trigger dismissal on rightward swipe gestures for consistent behavior.
