feat: Add navigation preference strings and 0.8.2 release tip

Adds new string keys for display options related to speed cameras, speed limits, and avoiding toll roads. Also includes a release tip for version 0.8.2. These strings were added to the Hungarian resource file but currently contain English values, requiring translation.
