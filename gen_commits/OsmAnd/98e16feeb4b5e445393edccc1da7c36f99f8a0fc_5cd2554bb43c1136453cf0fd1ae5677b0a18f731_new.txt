feat(i18n): Add parking plugin strings and update GPX translations for Latvian

Adds new strings for the Parking Position plugin (`osmand_parking_` and `context_menu_item_` prefixes) to the Latvian resource file. These strings are currently in English and serve as placeholders for future translation.

Also translates existing GPX upload privacy options (`gpxup_public`, `gpxup_identifiable`, `gpxup_trackable`, `gpxup_private`) into Latvian.
