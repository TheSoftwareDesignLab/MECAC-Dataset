refactor: Improve help link and title for map source editing

Update the help icon and URL for the "Edit Map Source" fragment to direct users to a specific documentation article on adding online raster map sources.
Rename the "Mercator Projection" title in the tile storage format bottom sheet to the more general "Storage Format".
