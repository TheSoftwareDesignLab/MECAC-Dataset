fix: Prevent duplicate accessibility announcements on map HUD

Marked shadow text views as `importantForAccessibility="no"` to
prevent screen readers from announcing duplicate information.
Removed redundant `setContentDescription` calls on the top bar
to ensure a clearer and less verbose experience for accessibility users.
