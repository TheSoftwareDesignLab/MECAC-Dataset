feat: Support general lane display when turn lanes are absent

Introduces `RouteResultPreparation.parseLanes` to determine the number of
lanes from OSM tags like `lanes`, `lanes:forward`, and `lanes:backward`.
This general lane information is now used as a fallback to display
lane guidance when specific turn lane data is not available.
