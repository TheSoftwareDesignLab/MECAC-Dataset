refactor: Rename quick actions and refine keyboard mapping

- Renamed "Show/Hide Navigation/Search View" quick actions to "Open Navigation/Search View" for clarity.
- Updated related constant names, string resources, and key event mappings.
- Improved keyboard key symbol representations (e.g., Back, Esc, Menu).
- Adjusted default keyboard assignments (e.g., Toggle Drawer to 'M', Esc for Back).
- Implemented dynamic icon for "Change Map Orientation" action based on current compass mode.
