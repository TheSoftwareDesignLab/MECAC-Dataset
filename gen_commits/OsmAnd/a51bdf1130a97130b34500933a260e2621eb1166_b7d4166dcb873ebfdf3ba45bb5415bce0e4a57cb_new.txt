refactor: Enhance context menu text concatenation for i18n

Replaced direct string concatenation with resource-based formatting for combining text elements in the map context menu. This ensures correct display and ordering of combined strings (e.g., title, type, count) across different languages, especially Left-to-Right and Right-to-Left scripts. A new string resource, 'ltr_or_rtl_triple_combine_via_space', was introduced.
