fix: Correct GPX spinner item selection and route clearing

Removes the 'updateSpinner' flag, allowing the GPX route spinner's 'onItemSelected' listener to always execute. Adds a check to ensure GPX route parameters are only cleared if a route is actively being followed, preventing unnecessary recalculations and improving robustness.
