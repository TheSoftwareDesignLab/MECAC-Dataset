feat(notes): Add dedicated list item layout and theme icons

Introduces `note_list_item.xml` for a consistent and richer display of notes in lists.
Updates `NotesAdapter` to use this new layout, replacing the previous `note.xml` for individual items.
Ensures icon colors adapt correctly based on the current theme (light/dark).
Removes obsolete divider and play button references from `note.xml` as they are now handled by the new list item layout.
