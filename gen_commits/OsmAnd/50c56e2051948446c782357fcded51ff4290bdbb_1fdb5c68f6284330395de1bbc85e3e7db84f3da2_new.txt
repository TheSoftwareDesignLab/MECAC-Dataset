refactor: Enhance trip recording sheet UI and interval slider visibility

Adjusted padding for consistency in `bottom_sheet_with_switch_divider_and_additional_button.xml` and `trip_recording_fragment.xml`.
Refactored `trip_recording_fragment.xml` to group the interval slider and "confirm every run" switch, and added a second divider.
Implemented dynamic visibility for the interval slider, making it initially hidden and toggled with the expanded info view.
