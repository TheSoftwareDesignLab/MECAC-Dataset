refactor: MapInfoLayer controls with new View hierarchy

Replaces direct drawing and logic for map info elements with a modular View-based system.
Introduces `MapInfoControl` as an abstract base for UI elements, `MapStackControl` for managing collapsible stacks, and dedicated `TextInfoControl`, `NextTurnInfoControl`, and `MiniMapControl` classes.
This improves separation of concerns, UI state management, and layout flexibility.
Adds `android:clipChildren="false"` to `main.xml` to support rendering of expanding views.
