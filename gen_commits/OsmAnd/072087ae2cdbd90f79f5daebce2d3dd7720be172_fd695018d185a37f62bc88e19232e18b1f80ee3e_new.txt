fix: Initialize map viewport with actual screen dimensions

The OsmandMapTileView is now constructed with the actual width and height of the window's decor view. These dimensions are used to set the pixel dimensions for the initial map viewport, replacing previously hardcoded values (400, 700). This ensures the map view's current viewport accurately reflects the display size from the start.

Also, minor UI adjustments were made to left margins in:
- `favorites_list_item.xml`: changed margin to 2dp.
- `search_history_list_item.xml`: added a 4dp margin for the type name icon.
