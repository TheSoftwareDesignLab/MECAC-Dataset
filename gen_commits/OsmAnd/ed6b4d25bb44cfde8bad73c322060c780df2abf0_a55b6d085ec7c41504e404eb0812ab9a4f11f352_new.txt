refactor(wikivoyage): Streamline search cancellation and UX

Removed `cancelled` parameter from `SearchListener.onSearchFinished` callback.
The UI now hides the progress bar immediately when the search query is cleared.
The search input field is automatically focused when the dialog resumes.
Results are always passed to the adapter, simplifying cancellation handling logic.
