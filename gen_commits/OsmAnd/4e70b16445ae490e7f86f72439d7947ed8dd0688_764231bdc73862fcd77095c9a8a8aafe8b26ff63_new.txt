fix(quickactions): Prevent unwanted space in switchable action text

The previous use of R.string.ltr_or_rtl_combine_via_space could introduce an unwanted space or incorrect formatting between the quick action item name and the selection arrow. Directly concatenating the translated item name with the arrow and ellipsis ensures precise and consistent display, preventing potential layout issues.
