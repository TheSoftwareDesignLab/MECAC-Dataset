refactor: Standardize UI inflation with UiUtilities for theming

Consistently use UiUtilities.getInflater() and UiUtilities.getThemedContext() to ensure
dialogs, fragments, and widgets correctly apply day/night mode themes.
This centralizes UI creation logic and improves theming consistency across the app.
