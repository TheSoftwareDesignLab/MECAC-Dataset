refactor: Simplify and unify map zoom logic

Consolidates and simplifies map zoom operations across the application.
Removes conditional double zoom steps, standardizing all zoom-in actions
to a single step.

Ensures any ongoing zoom animation is explicitly stopped before
initiating a new zoom to improve animation fluidity.
`MapContextMenuFragment` now delegates to `map.zoomIn()` and `map.zoomOut()`
for better encapsulation.
