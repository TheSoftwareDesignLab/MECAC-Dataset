fix: Correct profile icon color and selection logic

In `SelectProfileBottomSheetDialogFragment`, base app profile icons now use their
defined `profile.getIconColor()` considering night mode, instead of generic
active/default colors.

In `ProfileAppearanceFragment`, pass `getStringKey()` instead of `getRoutingProfile()`
to the profile selection dialog to ensure the correct profile is pre-selected.
